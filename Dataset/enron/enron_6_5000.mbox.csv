,09/26/2001,,louise.kitchen@enron.com,david.zaccour@enron.com,,RE: MBA Question for Louise,"A.  EnronOnline has been a extremely successful e-Commerce project in the energy industry.  As of September 14, 2001, it has completed over 1.4 million transactions worth $800 billion.  Currently, 60% of Enron's transactions are done via EnronOnline and the company's transaction costs have been reduced by 75%.    

Our business model for leveraging the internet has proved invaluable and is inherently strong.  We built EnronOnline in collaboration with input from commercial as well as technological experts.  Over the past 22 months, we have successfully the EnronOnline e-commerce platform to:  

1) Access new markets and customers
In addition to enhancing its Natural Gas and Power businesses, EnronOnline has enabled Enron to get into other markets, for example, broadband, paper, freight, metals, weather, petrochemicals, and even financial instruments from all over the world.  The system has been instrumental in reaching many more customers than previously possible via telephone or face-to-face meetings.  

2) Manage high volume of products and transactions
Enron does more than 5,000 online transactions in an average day.  Before EnronOnline, a buyer might have needed to make numerous phone calls to hunt down prices; now s/he can go to EnronOnline and instantly buy or sell a commodity at a market-driven price, with no transaction fee.  The easier price discovery attracts more companies to EnronOnline.  More trading builds liquidity and more liquidity tends to narrow bid and offer spreads, resulting in better prices and more deals for Enron.

To paraphrase Smart Business (September 2001), a long-term gas contract, that in 1981 took two years to execute, and in 1997 took two weeks - now takes less than a second online [thanks in part, to EnronOnline].  Because of the technology and software EnronOnline has developed, it is relatively easy for Enron to add new products to trade online, further making it easier to move into new markets without having to wait for long lead-times required to develop new systems.
 
3) Improve Competitive Position And Bottom Line

EnronOnline has truly differentiated itself in the industry by using the internet effectively.  The results have been widely reported in the media.  Internet Week (October 2000): ""Enron is a company that fundamentally transformed itself on the Internet - having whipped its existing businesses into online ones, ridden the Net into many new markets, added $60 billion in revenue last fiscal year, and has beaten Wall Street earnings forecasts in the first two quarters of this year . . . [Enron's] second quarter net income rose 40% from the year-earlier quarter to $404 Million, on 196 percent higher revenue of $50 billion . . . the Internet trading marketplace Enron launched in late 1999 is allowing the company to pounce on market conditions with startling efficiency. EnronOnline now does more than $4 billion a day in trades, in everything from coal and steel to storage services and weather derivatives. 

Enron was praised in Smart Business magazine (September 2001) as No. 1 of the ""Smart Business Fifty"" list for successfully embracing the Net to expand and enhance the business.  

Forrester Research (Forrester Report April 2001) predicts online energy trading will explode from a $400 billion market in 2000 (with EnronOnline dominating most of the wholesale energy trades), to $3.6 trillion in 2005.  Enron leads the field with double the online trading volume of its nearest competitor."

I am really getting worried on timing.  Could you guys get together and see if you can push forward on this today.  Try rining Dinerstien and explain the urgency.  
I did mention to Hutchins and Costas that this is my main concern last week.  So we should involve Greg if you can't get anywhere.
 
Thanks

Let me know your thoughts and possibly we can discuss at this morning's meeting.  I will be participating by phone from the airport as I am on my way to Stamford.  


As we move forward we have two huge tasks to complete at the same time, the integration with UBS Warburg and the re-start of our business.    The UBS corporate governance facilitates the creation of several committees which will meet on a regular basis to resolve issues and report on progress.  Within the UBS framework we will be creating a 'Transitional Steering Committee',  'Integration Committee' and 'Gas and Power Operating Committee'.  

UBS has already created the Integration Committee which we will merge into.  

Dave Forster will be attending all of these groups in the early weeks to ensure consistency and good communication.  Dave will also act as our point person for Mark Bridges from UBS, ensuring the simplest and most effective methods of communication are in place for both parties.

This email outlines the governance structure that will be formalized with immediate effect:

1.	Transitional Steering Committee:
This committee will be responsible for the overall management and co-ordination of the integration efforts for both the initial Launch Date and the later Disentanglement Date at the end of 2002.
Committee Members:
Mike Hutchins (co-chair)
Greg Whalley (co-chair)
Louise Kitchen
Pat O'Donnell
Mike Bolin
Proposed Logistics:
This committee will meet on a weekly basis until shortly after the Launch Date, and then bi-monthly thereafter until December 31 2002.
Minutes will be distributed to senior UBS and Enron management only.
Proposed Time	- Wednesday 8:30am CST

2.	Integration Committee:
This committee will be responsible for the day-to-day management and co-ordination of the integration efforts for both the initial Launch Date and the later Disentanglement Date at the end of 2002.  Any issues, which this committee cannot resolve, will be escalated to the Transitional Steering Committee.  

Proposed UBS Energy Committee Members:
Louise Kitchen (co-chair)
Pat O'Donnell (co-chair)
Mark Bridges 
Sally Beck  - Operations
Mark Haedicke - Legal
Wes Colwell - Financial Operations
Bill Bradford - Credit
David Port - Market Risk
Jay Webb - IT
Jenny Rub - Infrastructure
Peter Keohane - Canada
David Forster - ubswenergy.com 
UBS counterparties
Proposed Logistics:
This committee will meet on a weekly basis until reviewed at December 31 2002.
Minutes will be distributed to the Transitional Steering Committee and team members as appropriate.
Time - Thursday 9:00am CST

3. 	Gas and Power Operating Committee:
This committee will be responsible for the operational running of the Gas and Power Trading business.   The initial focus of this group will be the re-starting of the business. Following the relaunch the purpose of the Management Committees will be to push through its strategic plans and targets globally, to be able to react to market changes quickly, and provide a forum for communication across all locations.  These committees should also maintain, and develop further, any synergies between the Gas and Power Business and other UBS businesses.

Proposed Committee Members:
Louise Kitchen (co-chair)
Greg Whalley (co-chair)
Tim Belden
Chris Calger
John Lavorato
Kevin Presto
Hunter Shively
Rob Milnthorp

Here's a little fact - two years to the day of launch I turned EnronOnline off worldwide when it was in full swing, it was actually just when we had the downgrade announcement.  I think it will be back though.

I think I am still in shock that a rogue finance group and some bad investments brought down a trading shop.  That must be first.

Tuesday, Dec. 4 
I was part of the greatest team I have ever seen or heard of. We had unmatched talent and skill. We had a seemingly bottomless pool of experience to draw upon. We consistently diplayed unyielding determination and unwavering resolve. But, above all, an unbreakable commitment to help make Enron Online great. Throughout the decline we did what we had always done -- we did our best. 
* * * * *  ""Enron took my 401(k), they took my stock options, they took away the day-old pastries that were always on the desk outside my office. ... They took away my boss and my co-workers, whom I considered a family. I loved my job, and in the end they took that, too.""  Matt Hommel,  former Enron employee * * * * * 	
We have all read the news and we all know the things that happened at Enron and we all know the names of those to blame. At the end of it all, the truth is that bad things happen. For myself I humbly asked for only one thing: The chance to rebuild Enron Online. I waited all day praying that I would get a call to tell me that my wish had been granted. Around 9 p.m. I got the call from the senior director that I hoped was good news. In the utmost professional manner, I was informed that there was no good news. 
Now it's over. I still get a bit choked up when I think about it. I don't work at Enron, and the team that I was a part of has been scattered in the streets. I made some good friends at Enron, but I know I won't see many of them again. Enron took those friendships, Enron took my 401(k), they took my stock options, they took away the day-old pastries that were always on the desk outside my office, they took the free sodas and the big screen TVs and the foosball table. They took away the free dinners we got on Friday nights during the new releases to the Web site. They took away the admin who always teased me because I ate like a pig and never gained weight. They took away the guy that beat me in foosball 5-1, despite the fact that he played with one hand and was carrying on a conversation on his cell phone while he played. They took away my boss and my co-workers, whom I considered a family. I loved my job, and in the end they took that, too. 
But let me say this. I have my memories. I am not going to ruin them with feelings of resentment or betrayal. I am going to keep my memories. They belong to me.

Anyway EnronOnline:  There are two versions today - we keep one in NewCo and the Estate keeps one.  Two teams can be allocated for each.
It works - we have enough people to do it.

In terms of the Estate:
The Estate will keep a copy of the source code and the Estate will also maintain a staff on both the development side and the support side in order to ensure the service can be maintained.  The source code and build process are sufficient to allow for running almost immediately.  We actually have two EnronOnline environments today - the 'staging environment' and the real 'production environment'.  Essentially we would leave the staging environment for Enron - it is simply a question of staffing which I believe is totally possible now we have allocated the staff to NewCo and the Enron estate.

In terms of NewCo:
EnronOnline will be maintained for NewCo using the production environment.  With its own staff."

It's Saturday night in Houston and Marcus (my husband) and I just hung your painting in our dining room.  It looks unbelievable - we love it.  I decided because I loved it too much to bring in home and it is now in our home.  Thankyou so much .

Tammie will sort our the money on Monday.

I love it so much I had to bring it home.It is far too good for work.

Take care and obviously our thoughts are with you at this time.  We look forward to the yellow one and we have already decided where to put it.  I will take so photos so you can see how prominent the red one is in our home.

Take care

I apologize for not having responded earlier but I do not think I received the invitation, which is quite possible bearing in mind the difficulties here at the moment.  We have recently received approval from the bankruptcy judge to sell the portion of the business I jointly manage to UBS Warburg and in fact I am planning to relaunch enrononline (under our new entity) and we hope to be up and running around the time you are in Germany.

I am sure you understand that it is going to be a busy time for me in February combining the integration with UBS and restarting the gas and power trading operation under our new owner.

I appreciate your comments and thank you for your invitation but I do not feel able to accept.

I hope you all have a safe and enjoyable trip to Germany.

I really believe that putting Reg in the legal area is the best choice to ensure your group doesn't fall down any cracks as it doesn't have a direct equivalent in  UBS.

Once upon a time there was a shepherd looking after his sheep on the edge of a
deserted road. Suddenly a brand new Porsche screeches to a halt. The driver, a
man dressed in an Armani suit, Cerutti shoes, Ray-Ban sunglasses, TAG-Heuer
wrist-watch, and a Pierre Cardin tie gets out and asks the shepherd, ""If I can
tell you how many sheep you have, will you give me one of them?""

The shepherd looks at the young man, then looks at the large flock of grazing
sheep and replies, ""Okay.""

The young man parks the car, connects his laptop to the mobile-fax, enters a
NASA Webster, scans the ground using his GPS, opens a database and 60 Excel
tables filled with logarithms and pivot tables, then prints out a 150-page
report on his high-tech mini-printer. He turns to the shepherd and says,

""You have exactly 1,586 sheep here.""

The shepherd answers,

""That's correct, you can have your sheep.""

The young man takes an animal and puts it in the back of his Porsche. The
shepherd looks at him and asks,

""If I guess your profession, will you return my animal to me?"" The young man
answers, ""Yes, why not?""

The shepherd says, ""You are an IT consultant.""

""How did you know?"" asks the young man.

""Very simple,"" answers the shepherd.

""First, you came here without being called. Second, you charged me a fee to tell
me something I already knew, and third, you don't understand anything about my
friggin' business. Now can I have my dog back?"""

Netco does not have any disaster recovery facilities, equipment, software or people.  It is true to say that Netco is getting everything we have but we never had disaster recovery.  Netco is not getting additional equipment that the estate has to provide this function in the future either as it would mean the estate would lose functionality.

In terms of our budget we only have a place holder for $10mm in the budget which Jenny assumes would cover equipment and licences but not facilities or ongoing costs.  Assumption is that we would take this year to get it in place and budget for next year.  We really are guessing too as we never had this facility before.

For your information, I have attached the current proformas (UBS and the standard).  I know John and Mike have had a lot of conversations on this - essentially where we stand is that the work has been done to complete the commercial reductions (by name) but the non-commercial groups have just been reduced across the board and we intend to start the process today on how to cut the numbers on the non-commercial side.  The theory was that communicating the Netcolite concept was something we would not do until we had a bit more clarity.  Webb knows but that's about it on the non-commercial side.

Hope this helps.

Hopefully this will assist the meeting on Monday morning.

Contracts Structure

There are three key documents that create the contractual environment for NetcoOnline: the 'Password Application' (PA), the 'Electronic Trading Agreement' (ETA) and the commodity contracts in the form of 'General Terms and Conditions' (GTCs) (or, alternatively, a Master Agreement). The PA is the only document which needs a written signature from the customer. The other documents are accepted online.


PassWord Application (PA)

The PA is a one-page document and is the only document that has to be physically signed by the counterparty (as opposed to any of the other documents, which are accepted online by clicking acceptance). The PA is the document by which the customer agrees to be bound by the terms of the ETA and the GTCs.  

The PA, signed by an authorized person in the counterparty company, and approved by Netco, allows the customer to obtain a Master User ID. The Master User will be able to set up all traders and administrative users within his/her company and administer their access to various products in NetcoOnline. 

We will send copies of the PA to likely customers of NetCoOnline before we launch the site. The document will also be available to be printed from the website after we launch. Customers will specify their Initial Password in the PA and must change it in the first log-in session. Upon receipt of signed PA, Netco will under normal circumstances enable the Master User Passwords within 24 hours for pre-approved customers. For counterparties with whom we are not familiar, more time is needed to run credit, legal, contracts, regulatory and tax check.


Electronic Trading Agreement (ETA)

The ETA binds counterparties to completed transactions through NetcoOnline. When the counterparty accesses NetcoOnline for the first time, he/she will be prompted to read and accept the ETA in order to proceed. The ETA states that all trades done via NetcoOnline will be governed by the General Terms and Conditions (GTCs) posted online for a particular product, unless there is a Master or any other Agreement between Netco and the counterparty in place.


General Terms and Conditions (GTC)

To be sent when the Buyer is known.
When a customer offers to transact in a Product type for the first time, he/she will be presented with the relevant GTC. The GTC's are similar to a streamlined Master Agreement, in that they provide the general contractual framework for multiple transactions in a given commodity. GTC's identify termination rights, provisions for security (as appropriate), operational conventions (nominations, etc.), payment periods, tax treatments, force majeure, penalties for non-performance, etc. 

Customers must accept the terms of the relevant GTC online in order to proceed with a transaction, unless the company has a Master Agreement in place with Netco. Only one acceptance of GTC per Product Type per company is required. If there is a valid Master Agreement, then the system will not display the GTC, and the Master Agreement will apply.

I thought it may be helpful to introduce Dave Forster, Dave is the Vice President in charge of the commercial/operational aspects of EnronOnline (that was!).  We do have a relaunch plan in place which highlights critical timings which need to be met over the next weeks.  I hope this will assist you.  The attached document is a high level outline of what needs to be done between ourselves and the buyer.  

Should UBS be the winning bidder, we are currently planning to use the website name ""ubsenergy.com"".  If you intend to give us one of your own doamine names please let us know. 

If you have any questions  on the timetable, please do not hesitate to contact Dave or myself, or on the form of the agreements Mark Taylor.

I would like a black mat again.  In reality this is a picture for a friend so I will copy to her and she can order it directly based on the fact that it doesn't look like I got any discount for being a returning customer.

So Ellie, this is what you want with a black mat.  

MTX233-60 Solitude, Lake McDonald   $1030.00  ($936.36 ex GST  for o/seas
orders)
FRMM60 Mount and mat $198.10 ($180.09 ex GST)
      Freight $250.00  

Fay, please co-ordinate with Ellie.

We have had a lot of discussion on the contractual arrangements we would need to put in place in order to recommence trading as quickly as possible.  I am working on producing a fuller list for you today.  However, there is one particular contract/licence which does require special treatment - Power Marketing Licence to be granted by FERC.  In order to ensure that we start this process as quickly as possible we are looking to complete the filing documentation in advance of the bankruptcy decision on our future.
 
Our current strategy is as follows (all dates are approximate)
 
Present - January 10th, 2002        Complete filing documentation
January 11th                                Visit with FERC (One of senior executives here plus a senior executive from our buyer)
January 13th                                 File and request an expedited process
 
It would be extremelly helpful if you could identify someone for the Head of our Regulatory Group (Jim Steffes) to co-ordinate with at Citi.

Obviously we still do not have a deal but the deadline is approaching and preparations need to be finalized.

The main areas to focus on over the next week are:-

(i) 	Re-start/Integration Plans (due on Jan 7)				To be forwarded to Louise	
	These plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible.  
	The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14, 2002.	
(ii)	Budget (due Jan 3, 2002)						To be forwarded to Faith Killen 
	First year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized)
(iii)	Seating Plans								Tammy Shepperd to co-ordinate
	We need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the Enron South building.
	I have asked Tammy Shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around January 11,2002.
(iv)	Due Diligence
	We continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thursday). Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements.

I would ask that both John and I are notified of any changes to the Netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis.  Please forward all alterations to Jeanie Slone who has responsibility for the master list.

Communication - I believe that the New Year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on Netco and what our policies are.  I am asking David Oxley to co-ordinate with all of you on this.  I know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible.

If you are unavailable this week, please ensure you delegate this work out.

We need to start working on getting everyone together who is in Netco in time for the sale of the company.  The ideal move time would be either this week-end or the next.  The idea is that everyone (856) resides on 5 and 6 in the new building.  HR has the most up to date list of who all of the people are.  But essentially the organisation is just a smaller version of what we have today.

All commercial people on 6, non-commerical on 5.  We would need to plan for an office to be created in the room next to mine (but hold off on implementing that piece).

As the credit group is already here (in the room next to mine) - it would be really good to move them first so they do not have to move back to the old building and then back.

,12/26/2001,,louise.kitchen@enron.com,tammie.schoppe@enron.com,,Expenses,"I have never received any expense in my bank account, probably due to the difference in the names on the systems.  This is a huge issue and I need to know how much money is missing immediately and how this gets resolved.  I would think that we issued them in 'Kitchen' and therefore they were bounced by my account which is in 'Nettelton'.  I may be wrong if this is a common problem.

I may never have been paid any.  Please check all expenses going back all year.

This is a huge number which state they have been paid and have not hit my bank account.

Of the expenses showing up not cleared on my bank account I have received none of the payments which I think adds up as follows:

11/13/01	4,069:72
11/10/01	21,010:15
11/10/01	3,319:40

Plus I have a cheque for a prior expense which bounced which is for about $4000.

In pre- petition expenses this is clearly more than $5000.

In post petition - I also have expenses pending which will bounce if the name on the payee does not correspond to the account holder name.

Tammie - please work on this as our highest priority tomorrow."

They know you are picking up the tickets - you will need a photo id too. You need to be in your seats 30 minutes before the show - get a cocktail to take in - I recommend the 'O'.

We need to make swift progress on this - unlike in the US the contracting entity with our counterparties will not be UBS AG, London Division but UBS Warburg Energy (Canada) Ltd.  With the lack of parental company guarantees forth coming from UBS, this is going to be an issue.

There are two main points, because of our current history our customers will not contract lightly with a subsidiary with no guarantee and secondly the credit group are asking for guarantees from our customers.

I would like to have a pedicure every 4 weeks at the samr time as my manicure.  So I have an appointment every two weeks going forward for amanicure and a pedicure every 4 weeks.  The pedicure needs to be with someone else so its at the same time.
3.  Could you start working on the Trip to the uk at xMas. I need a chauffeur when we arrive to take us either to Kings Cross to get a train or go all the way home.  
Depends on price.  Kelly Ferrari will have the name od ac chauffeur company.
I also need the name of some apartments in London to stay in from Jill Whitehead - could you try ringing her - she has a web address.

I am not expecting any of this today, but its nice to have things to look forward to.

A user of ibuyit can select whether they want new equipment or old equipment.  So I surveyed our assistants - obviously more than ours up here, to see if any of them knew that you could order OLD equipment instead of NEW.  None of them did, including TJ Black who has since I have been receiving my weekly reports ordered the most IT equipment.

Jenny's group is to some extent relying upon this selection to buy the equipment.  Don Black's equipment was bought new even though he is about to move but will get used in remote offices where they have no flat panels.  So the buying is done by EA and someone else is benefitting.

As there is no way around ibuyit, I think we need a default where we use old equipment instead of new equipment.

Steve Hotte will take over from Beth Perlman as CIO ENA. Anthony Dayao will remain CIO EES but in addition to Anthony's EES responsibilities, he will also assume responsibilty for creating a combined Wholesale/Retail Power Trading and Risk Management system working closely with Steve Hotte. 

On the commercial side, I am thinking Beth.    I have had preliminary discussions with Beth and Mark on her moving over to our side to manage our requirements.  If you have a problem with this - let me know.  I have to say finding someone to do this is a difficult job and all ideas welcome.  I think Beth brings a base understanding of the business and certainly should be able to drill down on IT side.  Its a huge budget and we need someone really responsible for it.

On the operations side, I have asked Sally to take a large portion of the IT development budget into her budget as essentially its things like maintenance.

Bit of an issue here.  I had thought we were marking purely the intrinsic value of the options due to their illiquid nature.  I really think we need to mark these down to real values unless we can prove out the value by selling a proportion of the warrants into the market.

We also clearly have a write down from the number on the balance sheet which is way too high. 

Please could you evaluate the warrants and come up with a proposal of how we deal with them.

,10/15/2001,,louise.kitchen@enron.com,abigail.taylor@enron.com,,From their web page,"Why can't I consume alcohol on Atkins? You should not drink alcohol during Induction, but you can drink moderate amounts of alcohol during the Ongoing Weight Loss, Pre-maintenance and Maintenance phases of the Atkins Nutritional Approach. When given the choice, your body will burn alcohol for energy before it burns fat. But alcohol does not act as a carbohydrate so it will not interfere with burning fat in the same way that sugars and other carbohydrates do. 
Alcohol consumption may also increase yeast-related symptoms, such as bloating, gas and cravings for sweets, and can therefore interfere with weight loss. Beer, which contains yeast, probably has the most yeast-forming components of any alcohol. An occasional glass of wine or vodka is the best choice. Scotch and other grain-based spirits are more likely to promote yeast problems. 
Note: Use only mixers that contain no sugar or fruit juices. Even tonic water contains carbs and regular soda is made with sugar. Seltzer, club soda, mineral water and non-aspartame diet sodas are better alternatives.

I would put them all ahead of Bernie however I have no data points apart from p&l on nothing with Frank so I can't comment on him..  Not huge differences in order, apart from your slant on Canadians!  The main issue with yours is Calger behind Benson and Zufferli (and even maybe Dana), he's a future leader of this organisation.

Assuming we are starting with no budget for IT development, please could you sit down with each of our Business Sponsors and agree a number with them.  They are:

Tim Belden (or his appointed person) for West Power
Lloyd Will for East Power
Geof Storey for Gas 
Laura Luce for Peoples and Global Net
Chris Gaskill for Gas Fundys
Rob Milnthorp (or his appointed person) for Canada.
Mark Haedicke/Greenberg (or his appointed person) for Legal.

Each of the above will be allocated their charge for IT development and capital (apart from Geof who will allocate across the desks) and therefore is the best person/people to decide on the costs.  Please could you arrange a short meeting/discussion with each and agree a budget as the process so far is not working.

I am assuming its zero at the moment.

,06/26/2001,,steve.walton@enron.com,"christi.nicolay@enron.com, james.steffes@enron.com",,RTO Governance,"Jim,

	In Denver you asked for our views on RTO Governance, i.e., preference for Stakeholder vs Independent Board.  As a basic principle, I believe that the key issue is independence energy marketing, generation ownership etc.  I have given each of these a grade from 1-10 based on my preference.

For-Profit Transco--Grade 10.  The best form of governance is the for-profit Transco.  It is governed by a independent corporate board and regulated by FERC.  Independence is a fact of corporate structure and regulatory restriction.  The Transco can take on delivery risk, building new facilities as necessary to meet customer demand.  The Transco is prohibited from taking any long term position in the energy market, and it is compensated only by system through flow (total load served and energy wheeled).  Unfortunately I think the likelihood of Transcos forming is remote.  The biggest obstacle is the difficulty of getting around the tax problems.  The LLP/LLC structures skirts the tax problem, but it also results in converting a sizable investment in to a passive investment with control by a minority owner.  I think the only way to get Transcos in the short run is for there to be a short window (2-3 years) when transmission owners have the ability to sell assets to a company combining assets, without taxes.  Those missing the window would have to pay taxes on a pre-sale merger transactions as they do now.  This would compel owners to determine if they want to be transmission owners and spin off could occur.  Federal assets (TVA, BPA, WAPA) are unlikely to be spun off for some time, if ever.
For-Profit-Gridco-Grade 8.5.  I see this as a slight variant from an ISO form.  Like the transco, independence arises from  corporate structure and regulatory restriction on activities.  However, I don't think it can take on much risk for delivery or congestion cost certainty.  The Gridco will be thinly capitalized in comparison to the cost of the transmission system or the value of energy transmitted.  As a result its efficiency over the not-for-profit ISO is some share of operational benefits.
Not-For-Profit ISO with Independent Board--Grade 8.0.   This is actually very close tie with the For-Profit Gridco.   The best form I have seen is that proposed for RTO West.  The members of the ISO (the customers and stakeholders) select a nominating committee representing each class of members.  The nominating committee selects a search firm to proposed candidates who meet the conflict of interest standard.  The nominating committee elects directors from the slate of candidates.  Every member of the nominating committee votes on every director.  A majority of the committee must agree to every director selected.  Directors must stand for reelection every three years, with staggered terms for the directors.  The Board of Directors is subject to open meeting requirements except for personnel matters.  An Advisory Committee is formed of the members,  but it is open to participation by all parties.  The Advisory Committee meets periodically by itself and with the board.  However, any party may submit its views to the board on any matter.  The Advisory Committee serves as a forum for discussion but it is not a gate keeper determining what the board should be told.  There is no voting class structure for the Advisory Committee because it does not make recommendations as a group.  Individual groups submit their views directly to the board.
Not-For-Profit ISO with Stakeholder Board--Grade 5.  This is a poor option, far below the Independent Board.  The first CA-ISO board showed it self to be largely paralyzed by the inability of the various stakeholders to vote for anything that would harm anyone.  As a result, in my view, they never really enforced the file tariff, e.g., forming new zones when it was clearly needed.  However, two worse forms exist.
Not-For-Profit ISO with State Appointed Board--Grade 2.1.  This is an even poorer outcome, since state politics will prevent the ISO from ever acting independently.  This kind of board will serve at the Governor's pleasure.  It will discriminate in the interests of a single state.  Even if the board were appointed by multiple governors, it would have no incentive to provide an efficient market.  To include multiple states, an interstate compact is needed with Congressional approval.  Similar organizations (Northwest Power Planning Council, Colorado River Commission, Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, etc.) have slow reaction times and are political driven.
Not-For-Profit Transco--Grade 2.0.  Lacking an efficiency target imposed by a profit goal, a not-for-profit transco would tend to maximize the benefits for its own staff.  The management will want to extend the size of the enterprise to justify salaries and the staff will have few reasons to care about customer service.  This is the DMV.  This kind of agency will tend toward condescending, paternalistic approaches to its services, i.e., imposing the values of the staff on the response to any request for service.

,06/26/2001,,steve.walton@enron.com,james.steffes@enron.com,,Re: TOP 10 ISSUES TO DISCUSS FOR WHOLESALE MARKETS,"Jim,

	Sorry to be late.  I could only come up with a top seven.

Strategy for FERC Advocacy.  What are the potential risks of a Standard Model versus the delay in waiting for slowly developing Regional Proposals?
Congestion Management.  Depends on outcome of above discussion.  Do we continue to work on proposals not conforming to the Standard Model?
Definition of Long Term Transmission Property Right, (be that financial or physical).  This is the key to expansion; any party building or funding new transmission needs to have certainty regarding what they acquire for their investment.  Do we order transmission owners to build for revenue requirement and then just auction off rights once built?  This is really the old monopoly model.  Is it possible/preferable to use an open-season model for major expansion products between market hubs?
Allocation/Auction of FTRs.  The existing systems are heavily committed so little will be left to auction under most allocation schemes.  Often the existing claims have to be prorated.  The Grid Florida order seems to validate allocation proposals.  What is our position?
Secondary Markets for Transmission Rights.  The lack of secondary liquidity in PJM-FTR  and NY-TCCs goes much deeper than just the allocation of the rights.  What changes are needed to move the market?  Would a change in information availability (price and physics) change the market?  Does the definition right need to be modified?  
RTO Governance Model.  The paramount need is independence from energy market, which goes beyond the nature of the board to the depth of involvement in the market.  There is always some one pushing things like long run acquisition of ancillary services, which then gives the RTO a position in the energy market and its role as operator is biased to protect is position.  The California experience is instructive as the ISO has begun to see its duty of controlling prices instead of a duty to impartially operate the system.
Transition to RTO-World.  NERC activities seem to continue to be focused on the ATC/TLR approach while the RTOs are moving to congestion management systems in which ATC something of a anachronism.  Is this the time for NERC to be writing a entire new set of standards to meet the needs of a passing paradigm.

I've included a short status report on each.
 Regards. Howard

Merger of NYISO with PJM and NEPOOL into one consolidated Northeast ISO. Status: Protests pending before FERC. On 6/28 Agenda.
Elimination of ICAP market (long-term). While market continues to exist, assuring consistent programs among the northeast ISOs so that product can be freely traded across borders. Status: Stage II Tariff changes just approved by Management Committee; will make NY's market more consistent with PJM. MOU process being pursued by NY to eliminate current barriers to New England capacity being sold into NY.
Allowing power marketers to take positions inside the state. Currently, marketers can only go long and short at the border proxy buses. Status: Virtual Bidding, expected to be implemented by November 1, should resolve this issue.
Allowing multi-hour block import/export transactions to be scheduled. Status: On target to be implemented by November 1.
Access to Data: Status: Comprehensive list of data approved by Business Issues Committee last fall. Computer enhancements being implement and much of requested data has begun appearing on Oasis. All material should be available by end of summer.
Elimination of separate New York State Reliability Council. Dominated by TOs; marketers have no seat. Status: Raised as part of RTO protest. See 1 above.
Adoption of Best Practices to resolve critical seams issues. Status: Little progress being made. Unlikely to get addressed in meaningful way without FERC leadership role. 
Simplification of billing and assessment of transmission service charges for exports. Billing is currently done by each TO based on flow based models. Status: Under consideration in Committee.
Reduction/elimination of out-of-merit generation decisions by TOs. Status: Issue under investigation by ISO. Unlikely to be resolved without ISO assuming control over (i.e., securing) much of Con Ed's distribution system
Oppose circuit breaker, bid caps, temporary extraordinary procedures, penalty provisions and other forms of market intervention programs that impede the proper functioning of the markets. Status: FERC has recently allowed some of these measures to continue (bid caps and TEPs), although only for six months and not the 18 requested by the ISO. Circuit Breaker is pending before FERC. Penalty provisions just filed at FERC under ""exigent circumstances"" authority. Will be opposed at FERC. PR campaign designed to affect policy and public opinion to be launched imminently under IPPNY banner.
Revise ISO credit policies. Status: Major revisions under discussion by ISO committee in consultation with Price Waterhouse. TOs likely to be subject to some credit requirements for first time.
Revising the way day-ahead energy prices are determined in ISO model to eliminate impact of ISO unit commitment for reliability purposes when loads refuse to purchase their forecast requirements in day-ahead market. Status: Issue likely to begin getting discussed later this fall."
,06/22/2001,,dave.mangskau@enron.com,james.steffes@enron.com,,RTO Concerns,"Jim:
In response to your request at the meeting at the Omni I have attached my thoughts regarding RTO development.  But as only an occasional substitute attendee at a few MISO meetings you should rely on Mike Roan's comments to a much greater extent.  Should you have any questions please contact me."
,06/22/2001,,dave.perrino@enron.com,james.steffes@enron.com,"alan.comnes@enron.com, christi.nicolay@enron.com, steve.walton@enron.com",RTO top 10 (6),"Jim,

As per our meeting on Jun 15 below is a list of my top 10 (6) RTO issues:

Independent Board with stakeholder (advisory) board(s).  Once an RTO becomes fully funded and operational it is essential that there is an independent group of individuals responsible for making business decisions.  However beneath this organization should be specific stakeholder groups which work out details of issues to be decided upon by the Board.  The advisory groups should included at least a planning, market operations and monitoring committees.
Balancing Energy / Ancillary Service Market(s).  (Defining market as a place for participants to conduct trading business - not commit resources as in PJM, ISO-NE or NY and a place for the RTO to ""post"" requirements for ancillary services, etc.)  The market does not have to be run directly by the RTO but I believe, for the sake of liquidity, you need one centrally utilized (endorsed) market available for participants to access. This would NOT preclude any other markets from operating in parallel.  Based upon the CA experience, where, once the CalPX folded, there was not a significant increase in activity on APX.  Our real time traders need a market with sufficient depth to be able to liquidate outstanding positions in the physical market.  Without a single balancing energy/ancillary service market operated or sanctioned by the RTO these markets would become disbursed and we would suffer until the market itself sorted out which one it preferred to use.
Congestion Management - The rights can either be physical or financial.  There are two key elements, there needs to be some type of flow-based methodology for assignment and scheduling, and there must be a form of ""use-it or lose-it"" stipulation.  First, the mapping of the rights to the actual use of the system eliminates ahead of time most of the curtailments currently being experienced in the eastern interconnection.  A flow-based reservation and scheduling scheme, with proper information sent to the market, allows participants to be pro-active in resolving any potential congestion either by re-scheduling, offering counter-flows or simly accepting re-dispatch costs.  Second with no use it or lose it rule there will not be a robust secondary market of unused transmission rights. All one has to do is look at the lack of liquidity and trading of FTR's in PJM and CA and TCCs in NY to see there is NO incenmtive for the holders of those rights to dispose of unused rights or sell them to an entitiy who would find value in acquiring them.  A secondary market for transmission rights is essential for several reasons not the least of which is initial distribution of rights to incumbents and grandfathered contracts.  If these two procedures limit the amount of available transmission on a firm basis to the market, at least with a well designed secondary market this should make transmission capability available, at least on a short-term basis.  In addition it is key that the RTO process schedules in a timely manner and post to the marketplace unused transmission capability which would be available on some type of recallable basis.
Interconnection Agreement - If at all possible there should be an RTO-wide interconnection agreement (IA) available.  In DSTAR the stakeholder group had reached a consensus that they should have a regional IA, however before the TO's filed their informational filing with FERC they pulled the common IA and plan on filing TO specific IA's.  (Not being familiar with state by state rules the possibility for a multi-state RTO to actually implement a region wide IA may not be possible, but we should still promote this concept.)
Penalties - Depending upon design we need to be vigilant to biased ancillary service and scheduling requirements and penalties.
Web Site - This may be better described as market data transparency.  It would be better to be inundated with market information, as with PJM, than not to have information, as with the CAISO.  Transparent pricing information has NOT hurt the PJM region, in fact it has more than likely helped keep the markets operating as well as they have.  In the case of DSTAR it would appear that they should have sufficient market data posted, but as with everything else we need to remain vigilant. 

I hope you find these comments useful.  I'd be happy to discuss them with you anytime.

,09/26/2000,,donnie.myers@enron.com,kevin.ruscitti@enron.com,,ENA sale to EES at Willow Run (ANR),"Kevin,

 I received a statement from Wisconsin Gas that shows what we received at the 
different points from Wisc. Gas.  My understanding on the deal that we have 
with EES is that we only buy from Wisconsin Gas what EES requests from us.  
On the statement, I can match up what is in our system for all of the points 
except for Willow Run (Michcon).  The Wisc. Gas statement is showing that we 
purchased 13,291 dth on August 16.  I did not see anything come through for 
EES at this location so I asked Julie Boehl in volume management to look into 
it.  She did not see a brokered deal entered for EES at Willow Run.  EES is 
showing purchasing 11,408 from us (they may be incorrect on their volumes) 
and we are not showing any sales that match to this volume.  Could you please 
check into this for me and let me know if this is missing in the system?"
,09/11/2000,,charles.jacobs@enron.com,kevin.ruscitti@enron.com,,FirstEnergy 6/2000,"Kevin - Just when you think it's safe to go back in the water!!  Mark Zwick 
at FirstEnergy called earlier.  I had called them last week after we found 
all the deals to make up for what they invoiced us for June's production.  We 
had some volume differences that Mark called to discuss.  On two of the deals 
(281431 and 308806), we have a total volume of 108,000 and 6,007 
respectively.  They invoiced us for 117,180 and 6,512. He claims our volumes 
are in mcf's and that if you apply the conversion factor of 1.085, you come 
up to his numbers.  The question is - who's right?? - Do we input mcf's in 
Sitara and if so, how can we get them adjusted to the dt's they invoiced us 
for?  And if our numbers are already in dt's, why does he think they're not?

The other thing is on deal #303253, we have a volume of 2,952 @ $3.26 where 
they invoiced us for 8,045 @ $3.835.  On this deal, he says our volume is an 
imbalance volume for MAY production (instead of June).  Could there still be 
another deal floating around out there for June's imbalance??  He says he got 
to that number by taking the total volume and subtracting out the other two 
deals (131,737 - 117,180 - 6,512 = 8,045).  He's supposed to be faxing me 
something to show that.  Would it be possible for me to bring that to you 
tomorrow sometime and maybe we can call him together to work all this out?

Sorry to keep harping on this but I'm sitting on a $600,000 receivable that's 
going to start drawing some attention.  Let me know if tomorrow afternoon 
would be convenient for you.

The rest of the weekend was fine.  I forgot to tell you on Saturday night about our choir's performance at this community function we had.  In fact, I was on my way home when you and I were talking.  Sometimes our choir members are so sad, they don't always show up at functions and events like they should, unless its an opportunity to showboat.  So.....I had to sing on the front row on Saturday evening.  We sounded like crap....I was so embarassed, I actually got so hot and started sweating, because of my embarassment.  It was awful.  I just thought about that when your e-mail arrived.  Kendall was very whinny and cried alot yesterday, I actually thought he might be getting sick, because that was so out of character for him, but he's back to his old self now, just talking alot and being hard-headed.

I just called the lawyer again and got the secretary....she said that she had been out sick with pneumonia and the attorney had some major oral surgery, so she could not talk....so I'll give this firm the benefit of the doubt.  The secretary said she would have her call me back shortly or at least the secretary would call me and let me know.

So ""F"" is starting to feel the effects of his years of dishing out dirt.  I hate that it hurts, but most men do end up regretting their previous behavior.  I know what you mean about your Dad.  In my case, my dad would be saying, hold on....

Anyway, I love you too and can't wait to see where we both go from here....."

As promised, here are estimated historical pricing for deliveries at the Nipsco city gate.

These prices also assume that you purchased gas at the First of the Month Index.  Please keep in mind that these sales prices are for deliveries to the Nipsco City gate, and you will need to find out what Nipsco will charge you to transport the gas from the city gate to your burner tip.  If my memory serves me, I believe you indicated that you were buying your gas directly from Nipsco, and if that is the case, then we will be comparing ""apples to apples"".

I've done some research on the actuals that you make reference to (Vectren).

Enron's sale with Heartland Steel is at the interconnect between Midwestern Gas Transmission and Vectren (formerly know as Indiana Gas).  The actual volumes that you are reporting and consider to be your monthly actuals are volumes that I believe are behind Vectren's city gate (which means that you more than likely have an imbalance on Vectren's system).  This bears checking with Vectren, regarding an imbalance behind their gate.  You should be receiving some type of statement or invoice from Vectren.

Per the contract, Enron uses the Midwestern Gas Transmission (pipeline statement) to actualize our monthly invoices to you.

I've attempted to draw a diagram for you to make it as clear as I can.

,10/16/2001,,l..mims@enron.com,richard.tomaski@enron.com,,PEPL Class,"Here are my cryptic notes from the PEPL class:

The field area of PEPL is considered to be everything upstream of Haven

Haven is considered to be the demarcation between Field and Market area on PEPL

PEPL mainline divided into 100 mile marker segments

Two legs in the field area---Liberal and Seiling and/or Elk City (named after the Elk City Plant)

Liberal historically has been a constrained area, but has seen alot of non-constraints as of the last couple of years due to the strength in the West, as well as production declines in the area

For anyone trading PEPL cash, etc, it is important to watch the spreads b/t Rockies,  CIG, TW and PEPL--for instance the variable rate to move CIG into PEPL is roughly nine cents.  The fuel is 2.67%

Another big point that frequently gets constrained is CIG Lakin--point flows roughly around 175,000 MMBtu/d


Field Storage - there are actually two storage facilities in the PEPL field area, although PEPL considers field storage to be at Haven, Haven is traded as a field point

Greensburg off of NNG is another major supply area on PEPL--called Mullinville on the NNG side, it is called bi-directional, but most likely can be done by displacement only

Tuscola - is the interconnect between Trunkline/PEPL interconnect

Lebanon - often constrained

Also talked about not being able to drop off at multiple delivery points on PEPL--unlike ML7"

She's a member of a book club and they had their 3rd annual literary Gala last night at the Omni Hotel.  It was nice, but long.  The tickets said it started at 6:00 and I got their at 6:00.  The doggone ticket should have said cocktails at 6:00 and seating at 6:45.  I was tired of standing around waiting to be seated.  But, girl, Ms Thang felt so good last night.  I felt like a million dollars in my semi-formal attire.  After I left church, I went to one of my favorite stores, Chico's, and bought myself a nice dressy top to go with my floor length (not by design, I'm just not tall enough) black skirt.  The top that I bought set it off so nicely.  It was black, light brown and gold!  I wore my rhinestone choker and my rhinestone big hoop earrings, not the ones I wear all the time, but a new pair, much mo' flashy and my black high heel sandals that show all my foot.  Boy, I felt good about my appearance.  When I came out of the bedroom after getting dressed, Jordan said ""Mommy.......you look pretty.  Made my evening.  Of course, Bozo the husband, didn't say one word.  But I felt good, I even had Jordan take some pictures of me, so we'll see how those come out (smile).  

We have severe plumbng problems I discovered when I got back home, Todd said the septic tank is stopped up, I have no idea what that really entails, but it must of been ugly.  He was pissed!

Looking forward to rehearsal tomorrow night, speaking of rehearsal, I was wondering where Samantha had been, and Poiter told me yesterday that she's back in school, so that's why she's hasn't been there.

How did your evening go last night?  We still need to talk, maybe we'll get a chance to visit tonight.  Todd already said he wasn't going to be home until around 11:00 p.m. on Mon, Tues, or Wed, of this week, due to Power Mart.  I said fine, have fun.  I am so bitter, I'm ready for a change too.  Right now, it doesn't seem like me and the boys would be missing much.  All we do is coordinate our schedules to see when we can schedule different, independent, activities.  Plus, I'm ready for a new house, clean break and new environment.

Oh well, talk with you later!

Just a note to recap our recent and ongoing discussions regarding the disposition of the Heartland Steel and CSN agreements:

At this point, Enron's Legal Department has requested documentation from CSN that substantiates the fact that CSN did purchase Heartland Steel.  I have contacted your legal counsel, Mr. Tarter, and obtained information that will hopefully satisfy Enron's request.  The next step for me is to meet with my legal staff on Monday, October 15, 2001 to determine the following:

1) Is the relationship between Heartland Steel and Enron completely severed?

2) Do we come up with a brand new pricing and deal structure with CSN, or does the existing structure with Heartland Steel remain in place?

Once, these determinations have been made, we'll follow up with the necessary legal documents.

I'm hoping to have resolution to these entire process by early next week.

Talk to you then.


P.S. As a notional indicator, November, 2001 pricing for Chicago city gate delivered volume (which is comparable to your location) would be estimated at NYMEX (currently $2.41) plus approximately $0.10.

As far as a publication such as PIRA, that Enron would recommend, we really aren't comfortable making recommendations as such.

Regarding our electronic trading platform EnronOnline, I would like to spend a few minutes via the telephone, walking you through the steps to access that program (forms to be electronically completed).    I think you will enjoy having access to this tool, so let's set up a time.

P.S. Would you be trading under the entity, Corn Products, International, or another entity?  If it is Corn Products International, then we can proceed rather quickly.  I'd also like you to start looking at our ISDA agreements (International Swap Dealers Association), so that when you are in a position to trade financially, we have all the contracts in place.

Please reply when you have a moment.

Thanks"

I do not feel that the Heartland Steel/CSN issue is resolved.  We are now getting calls from a representative of CSN (Companhia Sidergica Nacional, LLC) saying that they have purchased Heartland Steel effective July, 2001.  If this is the case, then why are we continuing to invoice Heartland Steel?  Have we been paid by Heartland Steel?  Have we been continuing to receive the prepayments, and if so from whom?  Has CSN assumed the contractual obligations of Heartland Steel?

While the credit risk is not my responsibility, I am, however, extremely concerned that we really do not have a firm handle on the identity of our actual counterparty.

Will you please let me know how we should proceed.  I have a call into the CSN representative and it appears that they are not really happy with us, and would like to receive a visit from an Enron representative.

As we discussed the pricing for December, 2001 will be as follows (all prices are estimates at this time and will follow the direction of the NYMEX):

For Enron to perform full balancing, this means if you nominate 1,000 MMBtu/d and you burn 2,000 MMBtu/d or if you nominate 1,000 MMBtu/d and you burn 500 MMBtu/d..... the price will be  an estimate of $3.10 per MMBtu for December, 2001




For Enron to perform the service, just as we are currently doing for November, 2001, whereby you buy or sell the difference at a Chicago Gas Daily price.....the sales price for a baseload quantity (you select your quantity up to 1,500 MMBtu/D) will be an estimate $2.85 per MMBtu/d.


As I stated above, all the prices listed above are estimates.  As of this date, Enron will need to receive a pre-pay on the above listed deals.

Please call so that we may discuss.

Thanks




P.S.  The burns are as follows:

Date		MMBtu/d

11-12		  581
11-13		1876
11-14		1287
11-15		1180

Please show me a bid for this Cargill Deal.  It is 25 MMBtu/d day, May-October, 2001 with balancing and anything else that typically goes along with it.  I think the best option at this time is just ot get a bid from you.

Also there is a piece at Nicor that goes along with it, but it is a monthly volume commitment, and does not include balancing.  I don't plan to give you that portion, but it may be that the customer does not want it broken up.  The volume is roughly 33,000 for the month.

When I got in this morning, I had received an e-mail from Daddy on last Friday.  He said that everything was okay financially  for the future, and they only had an immediate need for the tax money.  He sounded okay with me asking about it.  He even said ""You are so sweet with words"".

He just doesn't realize, but we get that ability from him.

How was your weekend, mine was good, we spent alot of time outside.  We went to the B-Day party and the kids bowled and boy did Kendall love bowling.  In fact Jordan, ny athletic one, bowled a strike.  They call it bumper bowling because they put up little bumpers.  All the kids enjoyed it so much, Natasha and I are going to take the kids back in a couple of weeks and let them bowl one day after we get off work.  Bowling alleys notoriously have good food.  Yesterday, we went to the park and spent several hours outside, it was like in the low 80's yesterday.  I'm glad daylight savings time is here, its so nice to be able to get home and get things taken care of before it gets dark.

This morning, I went to drop the kids off at the daycare at 6:30 a.m. (mind you, I'm running about 10  minutes late) and the daycare teacher (the wife of one of Todd's good friends) that opens up the facility (she's the only one with a key) was late again.  Now the heffa was late one day last week and I didn't say anything, beccause everyone is late every once in awhile, but she made me late for work last week.  So...I blew up this morning and had to leave the kids standing in the parking lot with about 3 other teachers and 6 other parents with their kids.  I want to call up their and complain, but I think I'll talk with her first (maybe!)    She needs to get her stuff together, because first thing in the morning is not a time to play with folks.

Also, I hooked Cynthia Patterson up with one of my customers (A divorced brother from S. Carolina).  Girlm she called me this morning, and she was so giddy.  She said they really had a good time talking on the phone, they talked two hours.  They are meeting for lunch on tomorrow.  I'll be anxious to hear what he thinks of her after meeting her.

Robin called last night after I spoke with you and told me that her impression was that Rev. Jackson was resigning.  I called Horace this morning and asked him if he resigned and he said, Oh no, he had just made a mistake (I get the impression that Greg caught Horace dogging him out and called him out on him, and Horace being the good, honest person that he is, couldn't lie).  He said that it was his idea to get up and talk to the church.  Robin said he was just crying while he was talking.  He said he's in ""time out"" now.  I tried to ask him if Gregg put him in ""time out"" but he kind of kept talking.  He said he's really having family problems surrounding this church thing and he's just going to be sitting out for the next couple of weeks.  He won't be in the pulpit, he said Gregg would probably have him sitting with the deacons.  I asked him what is going on with the deacons,  and he said it would take all day to talk about that, and he had someone in his office.  I let him go after that.  Now isn't all of that interesting.   

I forgot to tell you that I spoke with Sharon Mayon on Friday.  She married Tyrone this past Sunday.

Sorry, I received all of your messages, but did not respond, sorry.  So little C.J. looks like a ""half-breed"", (that's what you''re trying to say!).  Is he cute?  I can't wait to see him.  Yes, I did talk to Teena yesterday afternoon, she sounded happy.  

I spoke with Daddy yesterday and told him to sit his butt down and stop trying to go to work, especially if there are no health benefits that he will be losing.  Instead of concentrating on that job, I told him to concentrate on his health.  He said I was right, and said he was going to seriously consider it.  I had to laugh when he said he went to work and fell asleep reading or trying to throw away some paperwork.  That was hilarious.  Can you imagine the secretary going in and finding ""little bitty"" daddy sitting there asleep.  I cracked up.

The concert was good, you know those young men ""showed out"".  However, the concert was supposed to start at 8 and did not start til 9 and had several acts before them and as a result, did not get out of the concert until 1:15 p.m.   I was a tired sister, but it was well worth it.  The Hilton Southwest is close to me, its right be Sharpstown Mall.  Tell me that dates again.

I need to look at the calendar again, but I think we will be leaving on Saturday the 9th of June.  We'll probably stop in Coffeyville for a day or so and come on through to Omaha.  

I'm sad to hear that Daddy's tube does not seem to be doing the job.  I had to hear that, because I too feel confident that if we can get some nourishment into his body that he will get alot better.  I'm so glad you stepped in and are taking matters into your own hands.  I also feel like Daddy feels real good that you are stepping in as well.  I spoke with Mom yesterday, daddy was sleep, so she really got a chance to tell me how everything really is.  She too is now saying that Daddy is in pretty bad shape.

I asked Daddy about the retirement, and he said the same thing,  he is not ready yet. but the reality of it is, is that we still need to move now and not wait.  I just hope he understands.  I'm glad Daddy is not in alot of pain.  I think with him seeing the boys will really cheer him up.  It's so hard to face all of this uncertainty isn't it.  The good part, if there is any, is that Daddy is going to a better place with no more suffering.  He's certainly had a good life and we all want him to go on forever, but if there is pain involved, I 'd rather see him out of pain.  Just keep praying for Daddy as well as Mom.

Tasha told me that you just got back from your trip abroad.  Was is just Fantastic! (smile).  Any brotha's and sistah's over there?  Hope you had a great time.    I would love to see pictures sometime.  I would like to purchase some of that eyeshadow base.  I think it is the triple action cream or something like that.  It has the gold cap to it.  Also, I would like some black eyeliner.  Just call me whenever you have it.  Also, I'd like some of that ""Stress Free"" cologne from the Private Spa collection.

Just let me know when you have it.  

Thanks!"

like to discuss the waiver of conflicts section with you):

Page 2, item (3) should read ""The payment of a ""project fee"" of $175,000 upon 
the achievement of each milestone described in Exhibit A to this letter.

Item (4) should read ""The payment of a ""project fee"" equal to 2% of the 
project's total cost upon the achievement of the milestone described in 
Exhibit B to this letter.

Exhibit A should read as follows:

Individual milestones subject to ""project fee"" payments:

1. With respect to Haywood Power I, L.L.C. (""Haywood Power""), the abandonment 
by the Tennessee Valley Authority (""TVA"") of its proposed 320 MW expansion of 
its Haywood County, Tennessee facility (""Lagoon Creek""), which results in 
Haywood Power being allowed by TVA to interconnect into an existing 500kV 
open bus position in the Lagoon Creek substation. Achievement of this 
milestone shall be evidenced by the interconnection specifications set forth 
in an Interconnection Agreement between TVA and Haywood Power, and the 
milestone shall be deemed to be achieved upon execution of said 
Interconnection Agreement.

2. With respect to Haywood Power, the decision by TVA to eliminate the 
Network Upgrade related to the reactive power requirements as set forth in 
Haywood Power's System Impact Study, presently estimated at a total cost of 
$5 million.  Achievement of this milestone shall be evidenced by the Network 
Upgrade requirements set forth in an Interconnection Agreement between TVA 
and Haywood Power, and the milestone shall be deemed to be fully achieved 
upon execution of said Interconnection Agreement to the extent such Network 
Upgrade cost is eliminated. To the extent that such Network Upgrade cost is 
less than $5 million, but greater than zero, a pro rata portion of the 
$175,000 project fee shall be paid.

3. With respect to Calvert City Power I, L.L.C. (""Calvert""), the elimination 
of TVA's present requirement for Calvert to pay for a Network Upgrade 
consisting of the construction of a new 30 mile 500kV transmission line from 
Cumberland to Montgomery. Achievement of this milestone shall be deemed to 
occur upon (i) Calvert having determined in its sole and absolute discretion 
that the overall project economics of its 510 MW generation facility are 
viable, and (ii) execution of an Interconnection Agreement between TVA and 
Calvert.

Exhibit B should read as follows:

The development and construction of a generating facility in cooperation with 
or partnership with certain distributors of the TVA (a ""Development 
Project""). Any such Development Project shall initially be proposed by Wyatt 
or Sideview Partners, Inc.exclusively  to Enron. Enron shall have thirty(30) 
days to make a determination as to whether to proceed with any proposed 
Development Project. Enron shall not have any obligation to proceed with any 
Development Project. At such time as all definitive agreements related to the 
Development Project have been executed, the Development Project shall be 
deemed to be an approved Development Project (an ""Approved Project""). For 
purposes of payment of the project fee, the milestone shall be deemed to be 
achieved, for Approved Projects only, 50% upon the commencement of 
construction of the Approved Project, and 50% upon commencement of commercial 
operation of the Approved Project. For the avoidance of doubt, a project fee 
shall not be payable for any Development Project unless it becomes an 
Approved Project as defined herein."

Tag 23841 was cut by 50 MW for HE 01 and HE 02.  Wally @ NEVP said he heard of the cut @ 23:30 on 06/27/01 but he neglected to call us and tell us about the cut.  The reason for the cut was PAC non-firm tranny being cut that PSCO bought.  However they sold us a firm product.  PNM didn't know about the cut either until their reliability person told them they were pushing power on the grid (Approx. time of notification 01:20).  We booked out with PSCO and PNM for HE 01 and HE 02 on the 4C345 part of the transaction (deals 666385 and 666387).  For HE 03 25 MW was cut and we booked out with PSCO and PNM on the 4C345 piece of the transaction (deals 666385 and 666387).  PSCO resupplied the power for HE 03 from SRP @ Mead 230.   The same thing happened for HE 06 as HE 03.  SRP resupplied  the power for HE 06.  I bought back for HE 06 from PSCO @ 4C345 and resold the power to SRP.  The deals are in the RT Inc. sheet for the 28th of June.  After the fact, I spoke with Ryan @ PSCO and he agreed to be billed liquidated damages for HE 01 and HE 02 on the MEAD 230 part of the transaction (06:00 on Kate Symes Phone).

It was not specified which bus it was to be delivered to.  There was a tag put out and it was made by us and has PSCO listed as the PSE on the transmission from the 345 bus to the 230 bus.  It was denied so that does not mean much.  I had a lengthy discussion with PSCO on this around 7:40am on the 17th(turret #149).  You will want to listen to the WHOLE conversation since we take several different directions throughout the conversation.  Bert also had a prior discussion with them about 3 minutes earlier on turret #143.  Craig should have done the deal between 5am and 5:30 am.  I finally got PSCO to take responsibility for the schedule in a second discussion at 8:15am.  They are supposed to put in a transmission request after the fact for HE 7.  They claimed on the last phone call that Craig did not say ""until further"" and they will not accept responsibility for HE 8.  He is supposed to pull tapes and get back to me but of course I have no faith in PSCO and am writing this now since, I'm sure you will hear on the tapes, the guy knows that he is wrong and wants to cover it up and hope settlements doesn't get after him.

 I enjoyed your recent e-mail but was sorry to hear about your dad.  It 
sounds as though his health has deteriorated significantly.  These are always 
difficult times.  As I watched my mother and father's health deteriorate and 
ultimately watched them die, it is a very defining time in our lives.  But we 
can be very thankful to have such great parents and to have had the privilege 
to have been raised in such loving homes.

 Sounds as though Eric has done very well as SMSU.  He is joining an 
excellent company.  I am also delighted to hear that he will continue his 
education working toward an MBA.  As we are living in an age where 
intellectual capital is so valuable, it is important for every young person 
to obtain the very best possible education they can.  As to our family, 
within the last ten days our youngest daughter Elizabeth was married to a 
young man from Buenos Aires, Argentina.  They met while they were both 
working on a project as lawyers in Buenos Aires.  They're currently on their 
honeymoon but shortly after returning will be moving from Buenos Aires to 
Miami, Florida.  This past Thursday night our sixth grandchild was born.  It 
was born to our son David and his wife Courtney.  It was a 7 lb., 10 oz.,  20 
inch little boy.  So we now have three grandsons and three granddaughters 
ranging from about 2 years - 4 months down to a few days.  They are a great 
deal of fun.  We are doing quite well.  I am looking forward to seeing Ginger 
""Rees"" Copeland when she comes to Houston.  I would be delighted to arrange 
tickets for you and your family should you ever have occasion to visit 
Houston.

 I hope you have a great summer."

The reason Ken and Linda were trying to reach you from the plane was that 
they had some suggestions for the hotel rooms and wanted you to know their 
preference.  They would like to give the Jasmine Suite that they are 
currently in to the Vittors with a connecting bedroom, to take care of their 
family.

They would like Mark and Natalie to have the end or corner suite that the 
Vittors have.

Ken and Linda said that they would prefer two connecting rooms, hopefully on 
the 3rd or 4th floor.  They would like for the rooms to have the ocean view 
on the North side.  If that isn't possible, it would be o.k. to overlook the 
pool, but they would not really like the south side as it wouldn't be as 
quiet.  The two rooms would give them everything they need, with 2 baths.

They said they can be reached in Switzerland tomorrow.  The Hotel Meierhof's 
phone number is:  41-81-416-82-85, Fax is:  41-81-416-39-82.  They should 
arrive in Davos about 9:00 a.m.

Dear Colette:

 In response to your e-mail concerning the upcoming New Delhi World Forum, I 
would expect that this forum should evaluate the impact of what is happening 
on our project at Dabohl with reference to enticing other foreign 
investment.  As you probably know, the State of Maharastra has been slow 
paying and no paying for the electricity from our plant at Dabohl for 
sometime and more recently both the State of Maharastra  and the Government 
of India have refused to honor their government guarantees on this project.  
We have filed a political force majeure on the project and indeed will be 
moving into arbitration on that and a number of other issues in London in the 
not too distant future.  Again, I believe this will send a very negative 
signal to the market place as to the advisability of international companies 
investing in India.  I would think you might want to build one panel around 
this subject.  

 If there's any way we can be of help, let me know.

,12/11/2000,,rosalee.fleming@enron.com,kelly.merritt@enron.com,,Re: Advertising Campaign - NASCAR,"Dear Kelly:

I appreciate your comments regarding Enron's advertising focus.  First, Enron 
become involved  with Enron Field for two reasons:  to keep the Astros in 
Houston and to gain energy and facilities management business for Enron 
Energy Services.  Acquiring the naming rights to the stadium came much later 
in our negotiations with the Astros.  In addition, while sports events like 
NASCAR are exciting to watch and get a fair amount of media play,  we're 
targeting a more specific audience with our advertising dollars.
  
Increasingly, Enron,s integrated products and services require the approval 
of an organization,s highest ranking officers, people who carry a &CXO8 
title, such as chief executive officer, chief financial officer, chief 
information officer or chief technology officer. These individuals may not 
recognize Enron,s name and abilities as readily as energy-centric executives.

We also want to reach the elected and appointed officials who set policy and 
regulations affecting Enron businesses worldwide. The ""Ask Why"" advertising 
campaign launched in February this year was designed with these groups in 
mind as well as to put the Enron name and image on everyone,s radar screen. 
Enron commercials continue to appear on business channels such as CNBC and 
CNNfn, as well as the History Channel, ESPN and network news programs. Some 
are running in Europe as well.

While we won't rule out entirely the possibility of directing some of our 
future advertising dollars toward sports events, for now, we believe we are 
spending our ad budget where it will have the greatest positive impact on our 
business.

Thanks for your suggestion.  Keep them coming.

Ken

Western State Power Forum: May 22 and May 23

Plans are proceeding nicely for the Western State Forum on May 22 and May
23.  We have an outstanding group of confirmed speakers and panelists
including many individuals that I assume you know as colleagues and friends.
I will be sending you more information on the Forum in the next few days. I
am going to send you the preliminary agenda  this morning.

You will be speaking at a critical time in the Forum; that is, just after
panels on power problems and polices and just before the final session
linking power and energy strategies to environmental objectives. It would be
great if your talk to the participants in the Forum could help them see the
relationship between power and energy related objectives and environmental
issues including GHG emissions. You should feel free however to focus your
talk in a manner of your choosing. Again, I will send you the prelim. agenda
soon.  Could you send me a title however for the final agenda's purposes?
We hope to print the final agenda later this week.    Thank you.

An Enron contact to discuss developing small-scale generation on Tribal lands.

Our views on the impediments to distributed generation and suggestions on how 
to remove those impediments.

A description of the credit issues that continue to impede DWR,s ability to 
sign contracts with power suppliers, and options to resolve them. Two 
possible options for addressing the credit issue are 1) a California PUC 
order clarifying that DWR will recover its power purchase costs through 
rates, and 2) an amendment to AB1X designed to accomplish the same goal.  I 
have attached talking points regarding the California PUC order and proposed 
amendments to AB1X.  We believe that an amendment to AB1X is the preferable 
option.

Our assessment of the supply/demand picture in California.

Our suggestions for a legislative package designed to solve both the near- 
and long-term electricity crisis in California.  We will deliver to your 
office today detailed legislative language.  In those materials we will also 
identify existing bills that we believe can easily accommodate our proposed 
language.

I hope that the information is useful.  Please do not hesitate to contact me

2. Key Barriers to Distributed Generation

Excessive and Unnecessary Utility Stand-by Charges

Solution: The executive orders issued by the Governor on February 14th took a 
step in the right direction.  Utility stand-by charges have always been 
designed by the utilities to protect their monopoly position, extract 
monopoly prices from customers, or both.  But there is no reason to limit the 
elimination of these charges to generation facilities that are less than 
1MW.  These limits will only lengthen unnecessarily the time it takes for 
California to close the significant gap between supply and demand and reduce 
the risk of black outs this summer.  We would propose lifting the cap by 
offering amendments to SB27X, which is designed to facilitate development of 
distributed generation.
 
Excessive delays and costs related to interconnecting facilities with 
investor-owned and municipal utilities

Solution:   The Governor,s executive order regarding interconnection is a 
step in the right direction*D-D-26-01 requires utilities to complete 
interconnection studies within 7 days.  California should ensure that this 
requirement applies to all generation facilities, including distributed 
generation.  In addition, the financial conflicts the utilities face when 
interconnecting generation facilities are simply too powerful to overcome 
through executive orders or other regulations.  To the greatest extent 
possible, California should shift control over interconnection away from the 
utility and place that control with the California ISO.  This could be 
accomplished through amendments to SB 27X.

Permitting and Air Quality Issues
Developers of distributed (i.e., &on-site8) generation that is 50 MWs or 
greater must receive certification from the California Energy Commission and 
therefore face all of the impediments to development that large-scale 
generation faces.  

Solution: California should ensure that the executive orders (D-22-01 thru 
D-26-01) issued by the Governor to expedite plant siting and maximize plant 
output apply equally to smaller scale, &distributed generation8 facilities. 
In addition, distributed generation that is less than 50 MWs continues to 
face local opposition.  The State should ensure that local, parochial 
interests cannot block otherwise beneficial distributed generation projects.  
These objectives could be accomplished through amendments to SB27X.

3. Credit Concerns Regarding Authority Granted to DWR in AB1X to Purchase 
Electricity on Behalf of the Utilities 

Enron responded to the RFP issued by DWR to enter into power contracts with 
suppliers.
Enron is in active discussions with DWR to establish contract terms with the 
goal of entering into a power purchase agreement as soon as possible.
However, ambiguities contained in AB1X have created significant credit risk 
concerns that need to be resolved in order to finalize contract terms.
We understand that the lion,s share of counterparties share Enron,s credit 
risk concerns.
Enron has proposed several options for resolving the credit risk issues and 
is working with DWR to arrive at a solution that is mutually agreeable to 
both sides and that might serve as a template for power purchase agreements 
going forward.

Summary of the Source of the Credit Risk Issue

Ambiguous Ratemaking Authority
The language in AB1X is ambiguous as to whether DWR has any authority to 
charge California ratepayers for the costs of purchasing power.  From our 
analysis of the bill, the language in AB1X appears to leave intact the 
California PUC,s exclusive jurisdiction over ratemaking in California.  As 
such, suppliers have no assurance that the PUC will agree to include in rates 
adequate charges to cover DWR,s costs of power purchases.

Ambiguous Regulatory Authority Regarding Contract &Prudence8
The language in AB1X leaves open the possibility that the California Public 
Utilities Commission could determine that power purchases made by DWR are 
&imprudent.8  On the basis of such a finding, the CPUC could then refuse to 
allow DWR to collect from ratepayers the costs associated with its power 
purchases.  Consequently, suppliers have no assurance that the PUC will agree 
to include in rates the charges to cover the costs of power contracts that 
DWR has entered into with suppliers.
 
Ambiguous Language Regarding the Ratemaking Mechanism that Will Be Used to 
Recover DWR,s Costs of Power Purchases
In addition to the ambiguity regarding ratemaking and regulatory authority 
noted above, the language in the bill is equally ambiguous with respect to 
the specific ratemaking &mechanics8 that AB1X directs the PUC to employ to 
permit DWR to recover its power purchase costs. Based on our analysis, it is 
extremely difficult to determine how the PUC would design the rates to ensure 
DWR recovers its power purchase costs.  Moreover, as currently drafted, it is 
difficult to determine whether AB1X would even permit the PUC to include in 
rates all of the charges necessary to fully recover DWR,s power purchase 
costs.  Again, this ambiguity raises significant credit risk concerns since 
suppliers have little assurance that DWR will have the ability to recover 
from ratepayers the costs of purchasing power.

Options to Resolve Concerns Regarding Credit Risk 

We have been working diligently with DWR officials to resolve the credit risk 
issues.  We have identified three options:

Amend AB1X
The amendments, which are attached to this email, would clarify that a) the 
PUC would accept as &prudent and reasonable8 all purchase costs incurred by 
DWR, and b) the PUC is obligated to include in rates the charges necessary to 
ensure that DWR fully recovers its costs of power purchases.  This is the 
preferred option, though we understand that the there may be some political 
challenges standing in the way of amending AB1X.  (See attached file 
entitled, &AmendAB1X.doc8.)

Clarify the Ambiguities in AB1X through an Order Issued by the PUC, and 
through Contract Language
This is the option that we are currently working with DWR officials to 
implement.  However, it is more complicated and could take significantly more 
time to implement than the ""legislative"" fix.  We have attached electronic 
copies of the talking points related to the order that the California PUC 
would need to issue under this option.  (See attached file entitled, 
&cpuctalkingpoints.doc.8)

Make Use of Other Instruments Designed to Address Credit Risk
As indicated in our letter responding to DWR,s RFP, we are willing to accept 
other forms of credit from DWR.  Those options include a letter of credit, 
cash prepayment, or an acceptable form of collateral.  DWR officials have 
indicated to us that DWR prefers to pursue the second options. That is, DWR 
prefers to clarify the ambiguities in AB1X through a PUC order and through 
contract amendments.

4. California,s Supply-demand Picture Heading into Summer 2001

Both the California Energy Commission and Cambridge Energy Research 
Associates (CERA), a private sector energy think tank, have issued reports 
showing that California faces a severe supply-demand imbalance.  They differ 
only on how much and how soon additional supply will be made available.  All 
credible sources agree that supply will be very tight throughout the Summer 
of 2001 and that unless a solution is found immediately, blackouts are 
likely.  

CEC and CERA both forecast that California will be short of supply this 
summer by approximately 5,000 MW.   These numbers are in line with our 
estimates.  California,s supply base currently has a 6% capacity margin, well 
below the average 15-20%, which is recommended for reliable system operation 
in the West.  Since the West relies more heavily upon hydroelectric power 
than other regions, reserves are particularly important, owing to the 
unpredictability of the weather and the dry year the West has experienced to 
date. In the event of a low rain and snow period, the system must possess the 
flexibility to respond to the reduced availability of power supply.  
California,s very low reserve margin makes it especially susceptible to this 
requirement.  

Other reasons for reduced supply for the Summer of 2001 include the early 
draw-down of reservoirs in the continual effort to manage California's severe 
supply-demand gap; emissions restrictions on existing plants; and a reduced 
number of customers who can be curtailed under their contracts with the 
utilities.  Cambridge Energy Research Associates asserts that at the current 
pace of siting, permitting and construction, adequate supplies will not be 
added to correct the market imbalance until 2003 at the earliest.

CERA predicts that California is likely to face approximately 20 hours of 
rolling black outs this summer.  The CEC paints a considerably more 
optimistic scenario, betting that California will bring an additional 5,000 
MWs on line to meet peaking summer demand.  It is our view that California 
should view the CEC's ""rosy scenario"" with considerable skepticism.

5. Suggested Package of Legislative Proposals Designed to Solve California,s 
Electricity Crisis

This email offers an overview of our proposed legislative solution.  We will 
deliver to your office tomorrow specific legislative language and existing 
bills that we believe can accommodate our proposals.

As we have suggested throughout the crisis, any solution to California's 
crisis must focus on four issues:

Increase supply
Decrease demand
Establish a truly competitive retail electricity market
Return California,s Investor-owned utilities to solvency

Increase supply--Legislative vehicle: SB28X (Sher)
To site and construct a power plant in Texas takes approximately 2 years.  
Enron and others have completed the entire process in other states in less 
than a year.  In California, it takes about six years, or longer.

The Governor,s executive orders and Senator Sher,s siting reform legislation 
are steps in the right direction.  Our suggested amendments can improve those 
efforts by further addressing the difficulties that project developers face 
in securing air emission reduction credits to meet the air permit 
requirements included in the CEC's certification requirements.  Enron,s 
proposal seeks to streamline the process for 1) obtaining credits and 2) 
transfering credits between air districts.  In addition, it creates an 
innovative emissions reduction bank to allow project sponsors to fund 
emissions in advance of obtaining certification, and permits the affected air 
districts to use those funds to finance projects that will produce the 
required reductions in pollution emissions.

Decrease demand*Legislative Vehicle:   AB31X (Wright)
Because of the delay in getting a solution in place in California, closing 
the supply-demand gap through energy conservation and efficiency offers the 
best chance of avoiding blackouts this summer.  This can be accomplished most 
effectively and quickly in two ways:

Buy-down demand
California is tapping into an enormous amount of money from the General Fund 
to finance DWR,s power purchases.  California could likely reduce demand more 
economically by running an auction to determine the payments businesses would 
be willing to receive to reduce their demand for a sustained period (e.g., 
through the summer months).  DWR could easily run an on-line auction to 
determine the price it could pay for these demand reductions.  To 
participate, businesses would be required to have the metering equipment 
necessary to monitor and verify that they are actually achieving the 
reductions.  Enron has developed an on-line auction software package, &Deal 
Bench,8 that it would be willing to contribute to the effort.

Use Price Signals to Incent Voluntary Curtailment
To be successful, customers need access to the following key elements:

An internet based hour-ahead price posting system to track the market price 
for hour-ahead power in real time. 
Real-time metering systems for baseline demand and voluntarily curtailment 
verification.
Settlement process that allows for market clearing prices of energy to be 
paid for load reduction (&Negawatts8).

The potential benefits of an effective demand response program would include:

&creation8 of additional summer peaking capacity in California, particularly 
in the short term, without requiring construction of additional generation 
resources.
reduction of  peak or super-peak load on the over-stressed California 
electric system, thus potentially reducing the overall cost of electricity in 
the state.
fostering of demand elasticity without subjecting customers to the full risk 
of hourly market price volatility by passing market price signals to 
customers and allowing them to voluntarily shed load and be compensated for 
responding. 

We estimate that we could generate a summer 2001 on-peak demand response in 
excess of 400 MW during certain high cost hours, and a demand response for 
summer 2002 on-peak hours that could exceed 1000 MW.  We further estimate 
that the market response to this program from all ESPs could be 2 to 3 times 
that amount.  We recommend that the State of California provide rebates 
directly to customers to fund the installation of advanced metering and 
control systems that would support load curtailment implementation.

Establish a truly competitive retail electricity market*Legislative vehicle: 
SB27X
The only customers who were protected from price volatility in San Diego were 
customers who chose Direct Access and signed fixed price deals with energy 
service providers.  Ironically, AB1X takes that important option away from 
customers and businesses.  It is critical that AB1X be amended to remove the 
prohibition against Direct Access.

Enron's legislative proposal would give customers freedom to enter into a 
direct access transaction, while simultaneously addressing the Department of 
Water Resources' concerns about stranded power costs that might result from 
customer migration.  

In addition, California will only achieve a competitive retail market when 
the utility is removed completely from the procurement function.  Procurement 
is not a utility core competency, as evidenced by the dire financial 
condition in which the utilities now find themselves.  California should 
therefore begin immediately to phase the utility out of the procurement 
function entirely, with the goal of having all customers served by a 
non-utility provider within 36 months.  To execute the transition, California 
should hold a series of competitive solicitations over the 36-month period in 
which competing service providers would bid for the right to serve segments 
of utility load.

Return California,s Investor-owned utilities to solvency*Legislative vehicle: 
AB18X
Utility bankruptcy will not increase supply and it will not decrease demand.  
In short, bankruptcy does nothing to solve California,s supply-demand 
imbalance.  In addition, bankruptcy increases the likelihood that consumers 
and businesses will bear the significant financial risks of having California 
State government assume the role of &electricity buyer8 for an extended 
period of time.  Finally, bankruptcy will undermine both investor confidence 
in California's energy markets and the private sector's willingness to 
participate in that market.

California can return the utilities to financial solvency by implementing a 
series of staged rate increases.  California should design those rate 
increases with the dual goal of returning the utilities to solvency without 
&shocking8 the economy or household budgets For example, California could 
amortize the recovery of the utilities, past debt over a 5-10 year period.  
In addition, the magnitude of the rate increase can be reduced in two ways: 
First, the utilities could absorb some portion of their existing debt in 
recognition of the risk they accepted when they agreed to the structure of AB 
1890.  Second, California can &net8 the revenues the utilities have received 
from selling electricity into the Power Exchange against the debts they have 
accrued due to the retail price cap."

,08/10/2000,,tori.wells@enron.com,galvan666@aol.com,,Sports Arena,"Dear Mr. Galvan,

Thank you for your recent letter concerning my support of a new basketball 
arena in Downtown Houston.  I believe that the responsibilities of my 
position at one of the world,s leading companies extend far beyond day to day 
business- I take a leading role in the communities where my employees live 
and work.  

I agree that corporate stewardship is essential in our community. At Enron, 
we are aware of the underserved populations in our neighborhoods, which is 
why each year we give back one percent of our earnings to charitable causes. 
As we have grown, so have these donations. Enron,s community investments 
include supporting programs that promote cultural diversity, educational 
programming and scholarships, and assisting those struggling to rebuild their 
lives. 

Three years ago, Houstonians took the initiative to keep the Houston Astros 
in town by passing a baseball stadium referendum that sparked the 
revitalization of our downtown district. A new downtown basketball arena to 
house our hometown Houston Rockets and Comets would amplify our current 
efforts. 

Houston has a vibrant, attractive, central business district that is 
recognized globally.  A basketball arena is of key importance for the 
continuing revitalization of downtown Houston, for keeping the Rockets and 
Comets in town, and for retaining an exceptional workforce in our world class 
city. We must not allow our city to lose its competitive advantage on or off 
the court. 

Enron has more than 6,500 employees who work and live in Houston and we all 
take great pride in this city and its success.  We plan to stay in Houston 
for a long time, and it is essential that the Houston Rockets and Comets make 
Houston their home, too. Downtown now has a new feeling and a new level of 
excitement and Houston cannot afford to stop the momentum.

Sincerely,

Ken Lay"

 I appreciated the update on your health status.  It appears you are taking a 
very tough situation and, with help from some of the best doctors in the

you know we are all pulling for you and betting on a positive outcome.

 Clearly your health is the number one issue now.  To the extent you want to 
work and can work, we are delighted to have you back in the office.  But that 
is a very distant secondary concern until you get everything done about your

redlined changes are attached.  If you have no objections to these changes,
we will then forward the document for counsel review.
1. We changed the party to notify in the event of default to our General
Counsel.
2. Under Article 5, we changed the Cross Default Amount ratings thresholds
from ""below BBB+"" to ""below A-"" to remedy the gap that otherwise would exist
from A- or higher and below BBB+.
3. Under Section 5.6. we added language to exclude our Joint Powers Agencies
from setoff provisions. Currently, they do not make sales to outside parties
since SMUD takes all their output. Since they are separate entities with
their own bond indentures, we believe it best not to include them as if they
were corporate affiliates.
4. On page 6, ""Transfer Date"" the time allotted is two days after receipt
from posting party. As we are currently organized and staffed, we would find
that timeline difficult to meet especially if we were providing a LOC. We
would prefer to have the time extended to 10 days.

In response to your questions:

done.
#3:  I'm fine w/excluding the Joint Powers Agency (take or pay contracts)

though...may want to verify and ask them of that.
#4:  I'm fine w/posting of 10days...as long as its on a bilateral basis.  I 
thought the ISDA accomplished that...but I may have misread it to apply to 
all margin calls similar to SMUD doing so.  Carol, can we have it apply to

experienced situations with certain cp's where we have had to come up with 
certain margining exceptions.

WRT amendments, such amendments can be done within the same time period as

representation (perhaps an officer's certificate of some sort) stating that 
they are going to their Board for posting of the collateral.

business day requirement for posting cash collateral nor a 3-business day
requirement for "" transfer date"" interest posting.

 We have a question into our counsel (who has been out sick) on whether we
need some form of Board approval for posting collateral.

Our main concern (and the reason we would like a 10- business day time
period) is if we choose to provide credit support with a LOC, we don't have
the staffing and bank pre-arrangements to be able to put an LOC in place
within a shorter period. Since we don't currently exchange collateral,
posting a LOC would not be something we do in the normal course of business.
As such, if the need should arise, we would like to have sufficient time to
allow staff to look at our alternatives and provide the form collateral that
best suits the situation."

Electric Business Understanding - November 27
The Electric Business Understanding Seminar will give a basic overview of the electric business for those with limited knowledge of this industry. This seminar is recommended for entry level to mid-level employees in either the gas or electric business or in businesses providing services to these industries. 
 
Understanding Swaps - November 8 & 9 and December 13 & 14
This course is appropriate for all employees wishing to obtain a practical understanding of the basic natural gas and power derivative structures that are traded and marketed today. An emphasis is placed on understanding how financial tools are added to physical structures to meet the risk management needs of clients.

Understanding Options - November 27 & 28 and December 18 & 19
This course builds on our Derivatives 1 program and is appropriate for all employees looking to extend their knowledge of basic derivatives. Swaps and options are revisited, but from a more sophisticated perspective. Option pricing concepts are approached pragmatically, both from the trading and structuring/marketing perspectives. The program does not involve complex mathematics.

Structuring Natural Gas Transactions - November 19 & 20
This course builds on the DI - Applied Energy Derivatives program, focusing on deal structuring opportunities particular to the Natural Gas markets.  Participants will develop insights into the economic inter-relationships between the physical operations (pipelines, storage, generation, etc.) and their synthetic financial counterparts (basis, time spread and multi-fuel derivatives).  Emphasis is directed at identifying marketing opportunities that follow from these concepts.  This is not an introduction to natural gas markets.  
 

For enrollment, or more information on these courses, please log on to http://elm.enron.com."

In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.

Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows: 

1.	Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.    
2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 
3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.
  
This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.
  
If you have questions regarding commercial aspects of this agreement, please feel free to contact Tom Moore, GSS senior contract manager at 713-345-5552.  For technical issues, please contact Hasan Imam, ENW IT manager at 713-345-8525."

In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

Tried to call you, but could't get through at 503.464.8637.  Is that the right number?  Here's some suggestions on how to access the data you want:
POINTS LIST:  My point list is pretty out of date.  If you have access to NW Passage, you can get to a current list by logging in, go to ""EBB"", then ""Point Capacity"", then hit refresh.  If you want to look at the capacity of a specific point, highlight the point and hit ""Point Capacity"".
SCHEDULED POINT VOLUMES:  You can look at scheduled volumes at all points, including the ""zones"" that we were talking about, via the scheduling screen.  You must be logged into NW Passage.  Go to the ""Noms"" Section, then the ""Scheduling"" window.  Click on the ""Meter"" radio button at the upper left and fill in the desired date or date range.  Hit ""Refresh"" and the point volumes should pop up and look similar to the view scheduling screen.  You have the option to save this information into a spreadsheet as well as look at volumes for a range of dates.  This should give you the same data as the unutilized capacity report with the addition of the other ""zone"" and throughput volumes.  It looks like a pretty comprehensive list of active points as well.  The scheduling screen is pretty powerful and has a lot of other features as well... you might play around with it or call me to find out what else it can do.
Please call me if you have any questions.

,10/16/2001,,jason.huang@enron.com,jason.wolfe@enron.com,,F759 and 900 data,"Jason, 

Maybe this will clear things up a little:

The monthly data (files ending w/ US) contain monthly data submitted by those respondents required to file monthly survey responses, and ESTIMATES for those other respondents required only to submit one annual survey response.  The data for those files, therefore, also include - for each State - a record for utility ID = ""99999"" and plant code = ""9999"" containing data values which represent the arithmetic differences between the ""estimated"" State totals and the sum of the net generation, consumption, and ending stocks data reported by the respondents to the Form EIA-759. 
The 2001 file will be a ""year-to-date"" file and is in this Monthly format until the data for the final month is finalized. 

The other files (Annual Data, files ending w/ YR) contain monthly data submitted by those respondents required to file monthly survey responses, and annual data for those other respondents required to only submit one annual survey response. No estimation procedures are involved. 

This only applies to the 759 (Utility) forms.  If you notice, there are only YR files for F759 forms. 

Also, keep in mind that for the 900 Forms before year 2001, the values are in Kwh and not Mwh.  To convert Kwh to MW, divide by 24 hours, 31 days, and 1000...not that you care about generation anyways, but just in case...

Got it?  Hope this helps.  If you need anything else, call this baller up here.

,10/16/2001,,no.address@enron.com,,,Third Quarter Earnings Results,"Today, we announced our third quarter earnings results, which were right on target with analysts estimates for recurring earnings per diluted share of $0.43.  This marks a 26 percent increase over the third quarter of last year, which is due to the strong performance of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural gas pipelines.  In addition, we also announced that we are on track for our earnings target of $0.45 for the fourth quarter ($1.80 for 2001) and $2.15 for 2002.

We made a commitment to you that we would provide you with timely information about Enron's business strategy and performance, so this email is intended to provide an explanation about our earnings this quarter.

Over the past few months, we have met with analysts to discuss Enron's performance.  We received considerable feedback from investors and analysts that we needed to expand our financial reporting to include details for more of our business units.  In response to that feedback, we have provided results separately for several of our business units.  For example, while we have provided volume figures for North America and Europe, this is the first quarter we have provided financials separately for Enron Americas and for Europe and Other Commodities.  In addition, information about our global assets had previously been included in our numbers for Wholesale Services.  This quarter they are reported separately.   Finally, even though our broadband business is now part of Enron Wholesale Services, we are continuing to report that business separately.

Following are the highlights of our businesses:

Wholesale Services: Total income before interest, minority interests and taxes (IBIT) increased 28% to $754 million in the third quarter.  Total wholesale physical volumes increased 65% to 88.2 trillion British thermal units equivalent per day (Tbtue/d).
Americas: IBIT increased 31% to $701 million.  Natural gas volumes increased 6% to 26.7 Tbtu/d, and power volumes increased 77% to 290 million megawatt hours (MWh).
Europe and Other Commodity Markets: IBIT remained unchanged at $53 million as compared to last year.  While physical gas and power volumes increased, low volatility in these markets caused profitability to remain flat.

Retail Services: Enron Energy Services reported IBIT of $71 million, compared to $27 million a year ago.  So far this year, EES has completed more than 50 transactions with large customers and more than 95,000 deals with small business customers.


Transportation and Distribution:
	Natural Gas Pipelines: IBIT increased slightly to $85 million in the third quarter.
Portland General: We reported an IBIT loss of $(17) million this quarter compared to IBIT of $74 million a year ago.  This loss is due to power contracts PGE entered into at prices that were significantly higher than actual settled prices during the third quarter.  Last week, we  announced an agreement to sell PGE to Northwest Natural.  This transaction is expected to close next year.
Global Assets: This segment includes Elektro, Dabhol, TGS, Azurix and Enron Wind.  Third quarter IBIT remained unchanged at $19 million compared to last year.

Broadband Services: IBIT losses were $(80) million in the current quarter compared to a $(20) million loss last year.  This quarter's results include significantly lower investment-related income and lower operating costs.

Corporate and other: This segment includes the unallocated expenses associated with general corporate functions. This segment reported an IBIT loss of $(59) million compared to $(106) million a year ago.

In addition, this quarter we announced one-time charges of $1.01 billion.  Over the past few quarters, we have conducted a thorough  review of our businesses and have decided to take certain charges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential  of our core businesses.  These charges include:
?	A $287 million write-down of Azurix Corp.
?	$183 million associated with the restructuring of Broadband Services.  This includes severance costs, a loss on the sale of inventory like servers and routers, and a write-down of the value of our content services contracts due to the bankruptcy of a number of customers.
?	$544 million related to losses from certain investments, primarily Enron's interest in The New Power Company, broadband and technology investments and early termination of a structured finance arrangement.  

With our announcements this quarter we accomplished three things:  1) we showed continued strong earnings and earnings growth in our core businesses, 2) we cleared away those things that were clouding this superb performance in our core businesses, and 3) We expanded our reporting of financial results to increase transparency for our investors.

IMPORTANCE OF THE GMAT:
	The GMAT score is a critical part of your application to business
school.  Indeed, in many cases, it is the single most decisive statistic
that admissions offices use in evaluating applicants.  While work
experience, GPA, essays, and interviews are all important components of your
application, the GMAT is the one objective factor that you can substantially
improve in a short period of time.

THE TEXAS MBA TOUR:
	All interested Enron employees are invited to attend the Texas MBA
Tour, which will be in Houston on Wednesday, January 23. The Texas MBA Tour,
of which The Princeton Review is a partner, is a group of six business
schools that host a joint MBA panel discussion and admissions fair.  The
participating schools are Texas, Rice, SMU, Baylor, TCU, and Texas A&M.  The
Princeton Review has agreed to handle registration for the event, so call
(800) 2REVIEW to register.

The net effect is that we have a $10 million reserve set up for CSU.  With 
respect to trader performance, $5.2 of that came from when Kevin McGowan 
managed the book (his entire ytd earnings before he moved to coal) and $4.8

on accept/reject/counter.

I am out of the office on Friday and Monday."
,10/12/2000,,greg.wolfe@enron.com,john.lavorato@enron.com,,For our discussion this morning,"John:

I spoke with Tim yesterday evening regarding your feedback to the 
compensation proposal I sent last week. Before our conversation this morning 
I wanted to give you a chance to review some of thoughts I have which might 
help keep our discussion more focused. 

First, I think we've both been at Enron about the same amount of time and 
probably share similar experiences about contracts and compensation at Enron. 
In general, my experience is that there has never been any open information 
by management about any overall compensation structures, equity plans, 
compatability between ENA groups or other Enron companies. Just as we all 
have to create our own path at Enron we generally must do our own research 
and draw our own conclusions about compensation within and outside Enron. In 
several cases we have lost people we are trying to contract as a result of 
the contracting process! In my opionion, this is mostly because of the lack 
of communication of any ""overall compensation plan"" which drives people to 
the market to make an evaluation which they otherwise may not be inclined to 
do if information were available. Among the many ENA managers I have worked 
with none has ever explained any such ""plan"". Tim has indicated that there is 
some sort of overall compensation structure plan that you and Dave Delainey 
are trying to adhere to. I would appreciate some discussion about this as it 
may relieve some of the concerns we all end up having about signing a 
contract without being 100% satisfied with the minimum amounts in the 
contract (primarily because we've experienced the verbal commitment which is 
forgotten or lost in the latest management shuffle). 

Second, Tim indicated some concern about locking in certain minimum overall 
compensation levels and that ""if a person were to have a bad year there may 
be no room for bonus"". I think this is a real concern particularly when we 
consider a new trader from outside the company. In my case, while I currently 
don't have a specific book that gets marked each day, I think there is a 
clear record over the past seven years of significant value to ENA's west 
power business. This value comes in several forms: value above the 
offer/below the bid, market information driving both short and long-term 
value into our books, developing new markets and products for ENA, extending 
my market knowledge and deal structuring capabilities on a continuous basis 
each day to other origination/strucuturing/mid-market/real time groups, 
building a no-risk/high value Services business, and providing leadership to 
employees about their role at Enron or Enron's role in the market. All of 
these efforts are focused on adding mark-to-market value to ENA in more ways 
than any single, specific book can measure. I am certain that I will continue 
to add value in these ways and have little concern about this ""bad year"" 
scenario.

Finally, I am trying to make sense of the proposed compensation that Tim has 
relayed to me. If I understand it correctly my cash compensation pay would 
change from $206k ($130 base /$56 COLA /$50 retention) over the past three 
years as a Director to a base pay of $170k as a Vice President with higher 
expections and increasing responsibilities. The equity plan that is currently 
available to Vice Presidents and above would be locked in at values of 
$175/$125. This one is a little hard for me to evaluate as it is new in its 
current form (I have been a participant in prior years of similar equity 
plans which have ranged in initial from $10k-$50k as a Director). Bonus would 
be determined annually, I assume under similar process as past years. The 
trouble I am having is evaluating a significant decrease in cash compensation 
after being promoted and locking in a known (versus unknown) value in an 
equity plan for which I presumably am already a participant in and for which 
there is little other plan information available to evaluate.  I would 
appreciate your thoughts on this in relation to any overall compensation 
""plan"".

I'll look forward to our discussion.

,10/20/2000,,kevin.presto@enron.com,john.lavorato@enron.com,mark.davis@enron.com,Seabrook Option,"Earlier this year, Dana had several mis-booking issues with the UI 
transaction, which resulted in negative trading hits in Q3 (already 
incorporated in P&L).   The significant items were:

 RESCO PPA (outages not booked properly) - $8 million
 Congestion & Ancillary Assumptions  - $8-10 million
 Millstone nuclear option ($32/Mwh option) - $5-6 million  (With sale of 
Millstone, this option goes away)

The $32/Mwh Seabrook nuclear plant daily option was not modeled for 01-03 
because the sale of Seabrook (expected to occur earlier this year) is an 
automatic termination of the $32/Mwh option, therefore the value was not 
booked.  Since the sale of Seabrook sale has not occured yet and a minimum of 
10 months is required to get state & local, NRC and FERC approvals for the 
sale of Seabrook, we have a positive value surprise to the tune of $10-12 
million (assuming option is booked through 9/01.

Let me know if you want us to take the value for 4th quarter or wait until

New Cap Specifics
On 10/26/2000 the ISO Board passed a motion by a vote of 13-10 to implement a 
new price cap methodology.
The new methodology will become effective 11/3/2000 or as soon thereafter as 
can be implemented.  CAISO staff has indicated that it will be difficult to 
achieve that start date.  They have not yet indicated what an achievable date 
might be.
The new price cap methodology will remain in place until:
Comprehensive market changes have been implemented and the market has proven 
to be workably competitive under a variety of load conditions.
Either FERC or the ISO board orders its removal.
Cap prices will be based on the average NYMEX L3D settlement average and the 
following heat rate table:
  Load Level  Heat Rate  4.00 Gas Example Cap
  <25 GW   10,775   $43.10
  25 GW to 30 GW 14,175   $56.70
  30GW to 35 GW  17,225   $68.90
  35GW to 40 GW  27,225   $108.90
  >40 GW   $250/MWh  $250/MWh
Caps will be rounded up to the nearest $5/MWh increment.
Demand bids and demand responsiveness programs are exempt from these caps.
The ISO will post the price caps for each load level at least 48 hours prior 
to the beginning of each calendar month.  Based on the ISO's two day-ahead 
system load forecast, the ISO will post hourly caps at least 24 hours prior 
to the hour of delivery.

FERC Context
FERC has delegated cap authority to the CAISO until 11/15/2000.
The ISO has asserted that they don't need FERC authority since it is a bid 
cap rather than a sales cap.  FERC regulates sales, not purchases, of 
electricity and therefore can regulate sales prices but not purchase prices.
The ISO has filed with FERC for an extension of the price cap authority.  
FERC has to rule on the filing by 11/18/2000.  (Note that this is 3 days 
after their authority expires)
FERC will release its proposed order on 11/1/2000 based on the results of its 
206 investigation of the California wholesale power markets.  We don't know 
what they will find or what they will propose.
The proposed order will have a 30 day comment period, after which FERC will 
likely issue a final order.  FERC will be accepting oral comments on 
11/9/2000 in Washington.  Enron still has to determine who will provide oral 
comments.
Many companies have filed at FERC advocating or opposing a litany of price 
caps, cost based rates, and market redesign recommendations.
It is likely that the price caps approved by the ISO board will go into 
effect.  How long they will remain in effect will depend on whether FERC 
extends the ISO price cap authority and whether the final order stemming from 
the current 206 investigation stipulates a specific price cap policy.

Impact of Price Caps
The attached spreadsheet contains a table of likely maximum monthly prices at 
different gas price levels.  We think that this is the highest that markets 
would clear since it assumes that each hour clears at the cap.  It is hard to 
say whether actual prices would clear significantly lower than the cap 
because we don't know whether sellers will offer below the cap or at the 
cap.  The assumptions behind our analysis are detailed in the bullets below.
Take actual historical loads from 1999 and 2000.   
Calculate implied price cap for each hour using actual historical load, new 
price cap methodology, and a range of gas prices.
Divide historical hours into peak and off-peak buckets.
Calculate average price for each month for peak hours and off-peak hours.  
For example, we have two years worth of data for the months of January 
through September.  Each month has approximately 400 hours.  for January 
through September, we took approximately 800 observations for each month (400 
from each year) and calculated a simple average of all of the individual 
observations.
We created a peak table and an off-peak table.  The table shows the 
calculated implied cap based off of the acutal loads at varying gas prices 
for each month.  This value represents what the month would clear at if each 
hour cleared at the cap (based on historic loads).  While any given hour 
could be above this value, our calculation estimates the likely monthly 
average cap value!
The blue shading indicates what the caps would be given current (10/27/2000 
NYMEX) forward prices.  The yellow shading indicates those forward power 
prices which are in excess of the proposed cap."

November 1 Tariff Change

Tariff revisions detailing and addressing the use of an Operational Flow Order (OFO) on Northern Border, which were part of Northern Border's approved Park and Loan (PAL) filing, will become effective on November 1.   Here is a brief overview of the upcoming changes.

 
Purpose of an OFO
 
An OFO will be used by Northern Border to 1) alleviate conditions that threaten the integrity of the system, 2) maintain pipeline operations at pressures required to provide efficient and reliable transportation service, 3) assure adequate system line pack, and 4) maintain service for all of Northern Border's firm shippers.   
 
An OFO will be treated as a tool of last resort.  Northern Border will first attempt to utilize its system, its services (transportation and PAL), and if necessary, assistance of interconnecting systems to alleviate operational problems before invoking its OFO tariff provisions.
 
 
Posting of an OFO Watch
 
If resolution of an operational problem is unlikely, such as when a daily or cumulative OBA imbalance with an interconnected party is outside of a defined tolerance range, Northern Border will post an OFO watch.  Similar to a severe weather notice, the purpose of an OFO watch is to pre-alert shippers and interconnecting systems to a location or area on Northern Border's system in which underlying operational conditions could prompt the issuance of an OFO.
 


OFO Issuance
 
Northern Border will issue an OFO if it is determined that an OFO watch has failed to serve as a catalyst for corrective action. 
 
A Northern Border OFO will be as localized as is reasonably possible.  Furthermore, each OFO will be tailored to match the severity of the known or anticipated problem being addressed.
 
 
OFO Impact
 
An OFO can result in either the curtailment of interruptible services and/or the forced balancing of nominations and actual flows through the confirmation process.   
 
If service is reduced or interrupted due to an OFO, Northern Border will directly provide affected shippers, as soon as possible, a summary of the service interruption that will include the operational variables that prompted such action.  In addition, affected shippers will be notified of any imbalances that require immediate resolution.
 
Routine status updates will be posted throughout the period in which the OFO is in effect.
 
 
Failure to Comply
 
When an OFO is issued, it is the responsibility of the affected shippers to make a good faith effort to comply.  If such shippers fail to respond to the OFO, or their response is insufficient to correct the problem, Northern Border may take further action including the curtailment of firm service or the immediate cash out of cumulative imbalances that are in excess of 10% of the Historical Flow Quantity.
 
Northern Border will not be liable for any costs incurred by a shipper in complying with or be exposed to any damages that result from an interruption in service due to an OFO.
 
 
Impact of OFO Tariff Changes on Interconnects
 
FERC Order No. 637 requires that pipelines ""take all reasonable actions to minimize the issuance and adverse impact of Operational Flow Orders (OFOs).""  Northern Border recognizes that maintaining daily and cumulative OBA imbalances with its interconnected parties within reasonable tolerances levels is critical in meeting such obligation across the grid.  Consequently, the November 1 tariff changes includes language which define what is an acceptable tolerance range on a Northern Border OBA imbalance.
 
To serve as a benchmark, Northern Border has already begun calculating a Historical Flow Quantity (HFQ) for each point of interconnection on Northern Border's system.  The HFQ is the lesser of the average daily scheduled quantity for the previous 15 consecutive Gas Days or the actual daily flow quantity for such time period.   
 
On November 1, the default cumulative OBA imbalance tolerance level for a given interconnect on Northern Border's system will be +/- 10% of the point's HFQ.   If such approach fails to meet the needs of an interconnected party, Northern Border's tariff does permit the use of an alternative tolerance level at a given point of interconnect as long as it has been mutually agreed to both OBA parties.
 
Furthermore, the daily OBA swings at interconnects on Northern Border that are on pressure control will also be monitored more closely; the default daily OBA imbalance tolerance level will be +/- 5% of the daily scheduled quantity.  Once again, Northern Border's tariff does permit deviation from this ""standardized"" daily tolerance if an alternative method is mutually acceptable to the OBA parties. 
 
For those who would like to initiate discussions on establishing OBA imbalance tolerance levels with Northern Border that deviate from the defaults described above, please contact Scott Coburn at (402) 398.7760."

When the calendar says no one off early, that also implies that no one should take vacation.  There are numerous tasks associated with closing out the prior month and setting up the new month which make those 2 days much busier than the rest of the month.  It does appear that the last day of the month is not quite as busy as the first day so we will be monitoring it to ascertain the need for everyone on that day, however, until we make that decision we would like everyone to be here. That being said we all understand unanticipated events and pre planned trips can sometimes interfere with your work schedule we just ask that you take the groups workload into account when scheduling your much deserved vacations.
	Another issue that needs to be addressed is the last day of the year and the first business day of the year.  Absolutely no one can miss these two days due to the extreme work load.  In addition we would like to give everyone the opportunity to have time off around Christmas or Thanksgiving in order to do this we need to see who needs what days off.  Please let Casey or I know what your plans are around those holidays.  Until we know from everyone it will be hard to allow someone to be off for both holidays.  Please let someone know in the future when you are scheduling days off before you enter them in the vacation folder so we can minimize the issues related to too many people being gone at the same time.
	Also be wary of your vacation balance and remember that according to Enron corporate policy you can only carry over 40 hours of vacation time, all remaining vacation time will be lost.  With that in mind try to schedule your remaining vacation time in the next few weeks so the end of the year doesn't sneak-up on you.

Thank you

This temporary worker will submit his/her weekly time online for your electronic approval.  Your response to each of these e-mails is necessary for billing and payment of the temporary worker.
 
It is easy to approve time online.  The steps are briefly outlined here.  After you receive the e-mail requesting your approval:
1.      Click on the link in the e-mail to be taken to the Submitted Timesheet page.
2.      Logon to the Submitted Timesheet page to view the timesheet. (logon and password was provided in an earlier e-mail)
3.      Click on 'Approve' or 'Reject' after reviewing the timesheet.  If 'rejected,' you will be required to enter comments.
4.      E-mail will be sent to the temporary worker and to CSS advising them of your approval or rejection.  
 
All timesheets must be approved by close of business each Monday.  It is strongly recommended that you review electronic timesheets as soon as they are submitted to allow for resolution of any issues associated with the timesheets prior to the deadline.  Any rejected timesheets will be revised by the Temporary Worker and resubmitted for approval.
 
Thank you for your support of this transition.  We invite you to direct any questions or comments regarding the online timekeeping procedure for admin/clerical temporary workers to Gwen Chavis / Craig McGee /Liz LeGros at 713-345-6899.

,06/19/2001,,liz.legros@enron.com,don.baughman@enron.com,,FW:,"GENERAL DEPARTMENT MESSAGE ANNOUNCING THE PAPER TIMESHEET TRANSITION TO ONLINE APPROVAL:
 
If you approve timesheets for Enron Temporary Workers in the administrative/clerical area, this message is for you:
 
Contingent Staffing Solutions (CSS), which provides centralized management for Enron's temporary staffing providers and temporary workers, announces the transition from paper timesheets to online timekeeping.
 
In our ongoing effort to provide greater efficiency and order accuracy to users of Enron Temporary Workers, a temporary worker for whom you must approve time will now enter time online through GRi, the CSS online application that tracks and reports temporary staffing usage.  Once a temporary worker submits his or her time, e-mail is generated that is sent to you, the approver, prompting you to log onto GRi to review the electronic timesheet. 
 
Your logon is:   DonBaughman              
Password is:     DBaughman      
Organization ID is:    2160                                
 
You will be prompted to change your password. 
 
During the transition period, you may have some temporary workers using paper timesheets and some using GRi.  Soon, all paper timesheets will be phased out and all admin/clerical temporaries will report time using only GRi. 
 
We appreciate your cooperation and welcome your feedback during this transition.  You will receive online approval instructions at the time of the order.  Please contact Gwen Chavis/Craig McGee/Liz LeGros at 713-345-6899 if you have any questions.
Please find attached training for order entry and time sheet approval.

Sarah Novosel and I talked with Marvin about his request:

(1)  He prefers to have the ""Product Long Description"" of the gas and power products in ""one computer format.""
(2)  Enron's response to Kim Bruno's questions stated:  ""At the end of each day, EnronOnline makes available to all customers through EnronOnline the weighted average price of that day's transactions.  The data associated with US Natural Gas is sent in this format to Gas Daily for inclusion in their automated exchange index.""  Marvin wants to know how to find this data on EnronOnline.
(3) He wants to know who has authority to list and delist products on EnronOnline.  In addition, he would like the list of gas and power products that were available on June 30 and whether any of those products have been ""delisted"" on July 1 (or why some products may only appear at certain times of the month.)

All Metro passes offered through the Enron Parking & Transportation desk will be the Metro 30 Day Zone Pass.  When you use a 30-day zone pass, bus service is divided into four zones w/ unlimited rides.  The zone pass is time activated, which means that it will not become active until the first time it is used and will not expire until 30 days after it was used for the first time.  New passes will be available to Enron employees upon expiration of the 30 day time period. Each zone does have a different fare values based on the distance the bus travels. This is important to any buser who wants to transfer to or travel in a higher-cost zone than the zone pass they have, in this case the difference must be paid in cash.  If they are traveling in a lower cost zone, then there is no extra cost.

Given the drill we went through today in preparing for the January schedules in PJM and NEPOOL, it became apparent we need to get all the team members on the same page and make sure we have a good system for notifying all relevant parties of terminations, changes, etc.

Bill/Ed - Can you please run the most recent DPR for non-terminated East Power contracts.

Casey and Stacey - will you please update the spreadsheet that you ran for Kevin last week.

Let's make sure we all agree on contracts that have been terminated.  As most of you probably have seen, a number of terminations have been received in the past several days (see below).

United Illuminating - effective January 1, 2002
HQ Energy Services - effective January 1, 2002
First Energy Solutions - effective January 2, 2002
Old Dominion - effective January 10, 2002 - we should schedule in PJM through the 10th of January (do we have any other positions with Old Dominion).
Ameren Energy
GPU Energy - effective January 21, 2002 - we should schedule in PJM through the 21st of January (they may push back, but we should remind them that they will be subject to LDs).

LIBERTY GAS STORAGE PROJECT - We appreciated the insight from Zimin Lu on the 
Liberty Gas Storage project.  I had originally thought that Enron could 
negotiate a deal directly with HNG Storage Co. on the joint development of 
these facilities.  However, HNGS has now retained Wasserstein Pirella to 
""market"" the opportunity.  [FYI - Wasserstein was the Investment Banker that 
handled the recent sale of the Market Hub Partners storage facilities, so 
they certainly would have a current list of interested parties.]  
Unfortuneately, we will now have to participate in another ""auction"" if we 
are to pursue this further.  I'll let you know what we decide to do.

ALASKA / NORTHERN CANADA PIPELINE - I would like to discuss ways that Enron 
might enhance our prospect of participating in the initiative to bring 
substantial new gas reserves from Alaska and northern Canada to the lower 
48.  A large equity investment in a very expensive, regulated pipeline is not 
likely to get much support within Enron.  Instead, our competitive advantage 
may best be realized through the efficient and creative utilization of the 
existing US pipeline grid, (""backhaul"" on Northern Natural, expansion 
opportunities on Northern Border and NNG, or even capacity exchanges with 
other pipeline operators).

I think it would be very useful if we had the capability to model the impact 
of the evolving North American marketplace on that initiative, and vice 
versa.  Any insight we could develop on who will be the eventual ""winners"" 
and ""losers"" if / when that large volume of new gas enters the market would 
be valuable. 

I will look forward to our discussion tomorrow (Thursday) at 1:30 PM.

The Rofr option, which grants the shipper the right to lock in the 
transportation rate (max rate) for next
a few years, is priced as a spread swaption. 

I priced two scenarios for you:  the strip starts 1) Nov.1-00 and 2)Nov. 1-01.
For the first one I assume that the shipper makes decision on Oct. 31,00 (54 
days  to maturity)
and  on Oct. 31,01(419 days to maturity)  for the second case.

The second case has longer time to expiration, therefore larger option time 
value. See the attached
spreadsheets for more detail.

Let me know if you have any questions.

years reviewing our stuff and setting up contacts for us in your company.
We will give Kim a call early next week after Easter.  We have made a lot of
progress on MarketPoint, which I think will be of keen interest to your

architecture are both improved relative to what you and your people were

Natural Gas Model for use in the ETS Revenue Management effort.  I agree that 
the ability to model various supply / demand scenarios for North America 
should prove useful in ETS business development efforts, and in particular, 
in predicting the impact of the new, large Alaskan gas supplies on the N.A. 
pipeline grid.

As you know, Vince Kaminski feels that a software product developed by Dale 
Nesbitt (MarketPoint, Inc.) of Los Altos Hills, CA. may be a good choice, and 
one readily available in a relatively short time.  MarketPoint has proposed 
that they work with us in our offices for a week of intensive training and 
testing, so we can make a more informed decision before ordering the 
software.  They have proposed a charge of $12,000, plus expenses, for the 
one-week session, with that cost applied to the first year's subscription 
price (approx. $55-60 M/yr) should we decide to go forward.  The other 
details (timing, ENE resources required, necessary IT interface, etc) still 
need to be worked out, but I believe there is generally a consensus to 
proceed with the test.  

With my recent relocation to the Clean Fuels group, I will no longer be 
responsible for the Alaskan pipeline development.  However, Danny McCarty is 
pulling together a team consisting of people from NNG, NBP and elsewhere in 
ETS to push the project forward.  I believe Eric Gadd will be playing a key 
role as well.  The decision on the long term gas model should appropriately 
be made by the new project team.   

I have attached a draft of the proposed MarketPoint License agreement.  It 
has not yet been fully reviewed by legal (or by Shelley C. for the 
""affiliate"" issues).  

Let me know if I can provide any other background or assistance.

,01/31/2001,,rhonda.denton@enron.com,kate.symes@enron.com,,Re: Incorrect Counterparties,"I talked to Bill Williams and told him a quick (but not always perfect) way 
to see if it is the correct CP is to select the CP and then click on the Deal 
Clearing tab.  If there is a contract there or if you click on the arrow and 
a number is there, we have a K with that entity and it is the correct CP.  If 
it is blank under Global Contracts even after you click on the arrow, we do 
not have a contract with that entity and you have probably chosen the wrong 
CP.  I will also send him a list of entities we have Ks with, but he did not 
want them to have to look at a list.  Its probably a learning curve but at 
least this is a step in the right direction.  Let me know if you can think of 
other ways to help them.

Please note that:
 ERMS short names will be changed in GCP and ERMS each Friday at 10am Central

We have made a few changes to our Name Change/Merger Notification Report - it 
now has a new look and a couple of features we hope will assist you.  For 
more information, please click below:


Each month now has two sheets, a summary sheet (eg Jan 01 Changes) and a 
detailed sheet (eg Jan 01).
Click below for more information:

The summary sheet can be used to view all changes after a certain date.  If 
you're aware of all changes up to, say, January 15th enter 01/16/2001 in cell 
C6 of the Summary Sheet and click the Sort button in cell H6.  All changes 
made to the report on or after January 16th will be listed automatically.
The Summary sheet may also be sorted for certain criteria - use the drop down 
arrows alongside the column headers to make your selection.

This sheet contains all the information you are used to seeing, but slightly 
reformatted.  Key points are: 
In the case of an Inactivation, the cause of the Inactivation (eg Merger) is 
listed in the Comments section
As with the previous format, 
all months' reports will be sent cumulatively throughout the year
the report will be sent out twice each month, on the 15th and at the end of 
the month.


It is our aim to publish the report in Livelink and to send out only the 
summary sheet and a URL for the detailed report each month.  This will save a 
lot of space in Lotus Notes and we hope it will streamline your monitoring 
process.

We'd be very happy to receive any comments you may have.

report was distributed early, on 02/09/01.  This is the FINAL report for 
February.   Please note that the changes, since the preliminary report, are 
on the ""February 01 Changes"" tab, and the detail is on the ""Feb 2001"" tab.   
You have received notification on the name changes as they have occurred.  

Please find attached the Name Change/Merger Notification Report for 
February.   To launch the report, double click on the attachment and select 
Enable Macros and Read Only.
Please note that:
 ERMS short names will be changed in GCP and ERMS each Friday at 10am Central 
Time, and 
 Inactivations will be made on Mar 1
 Please adjust paper size to fit your needs

We have made a few changes to our Name Change/Merger Notification Report - it 
now has a new look and a couple of features we hope will assist you.  For 
more information, please click below:




Each month now has two sheets, a summary sheet (eg Jan 01 Changes) and a 
detailed sheet (eg Jan 01).
Click below for more information:

The summary sheet can be used to view all changes after a certain date.  If 
you're aware of all changes up to, say, January 15th enter 01/16/2001 in cell 
C6 of the Summary Sheet and click the Sort button in cell H6.  All changes 
made to the report on or after January 16th will be listed automatically.
The Summary sheet may also be sorted for certain criteria - use the drop down 
arrows alongside the column headers to make your selection.

This sheet contains all the information you are used to seeing, but slightly 
reformatted.  Key points are: 
In the case of an Inactivation, the cause of the Inactivation (eg Merger) is 
listed in the Comments section
As with the previous format, 
all months' reports will be sent cumulatively throughout the year
the report will be sent out twice each month, on the 15th and at the end of 
the month.


It is our aim to publish the report in Livelink and to send out only the 
summary sheet and a URL for the detailed report each month.  This will save a 
lot of space in Lotus Notes and we hope it will streamline your monitoring 
process.

We'd be very happy to receive any comments you may have.

To launch the report, double click on the attachment and select Enable Macros 
and Read Only.
Please note that:
 ERMS short names will be changed in GCP and ERMS each Friday at 10am Central 
Time, and 
 Inactivations will be made on Feb 1

We have made a few changes to our Name Change/Merger Notification Report - it 
now has a new look and a couple of features we hope will assist you.  For 
more information, please click below:


Each month now has two sheets, a summary sheet (eg Jan 01 Changes) and a 
detailed sheet (eg Jan 01).
Click below for more information:

The summary sheet can be used to view all changes after a certain date.  If 
you're aware of all changes up to, say, January 15th enter 01/16/2001 in cell 
C6 of the Summary Sheet and click the Sort button in cell H6.  All changes 
made to the report on or after January 16th will be listed automatically.
The Summary sheet may also be sorted for certain criteria - use the drop down 
arrows alongside the column headers to make your selection.

This sheet contains all the information you are used to seeing, but slightly 
reformatted.  Key points are: 
In the case of an Inactivation, the cause of the Inactivation (eg Merger) is 
listed in the Comments section
As with the previous format, 
all months' reports will be sent cumulatively throughout the year
the report will be sent out twice each month, on the 15th and at the end of 
the month.


It is our aim to publish the report in Livelink and to send out only the 
summary sheet and a URL for the detailed report each month.  This will save a 
lot of space in Lotus Notes and we hope it will streamline your monitoring 
process.

We'd be very happy to receive any comments you may have."

Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft, CP ID 55900, and

Deutsche Bank AG, CP ID 92230

Credit has verified that the correct legal name should be Deutsche Bank, AG.  
A record in that name was just created in GCP in Feb '01.  In order to 
preserve the history on the old record, and since one name is just an 
abbreviated form of the other, I will make the correction on the older 
record, 55900 to change it to ""AG"" and suspend the newer record, 92230, 
pending inactivation on 04/01/01.  This is not an overlay, so I wanted to 
provide some explanation in advance. 

Please note the overlays.  These changes were made in GCP today, with the 
noted exception.  The summary of those changes are on the ""Mar 01 Changes"" 
tab (refer to bottom left corner), to see the detail for those entries, see 
the ""Mar 2001"" bottom tab.

Shortname changes will be coordinated w/ ERMS IT on Friday, March 16.

Records will be inactivated on April 2, 2001.

Please note that there 
are overlays that were completed in the system TODAY, but most were completed 
prior to this distribution and notification was sent at the time the changes 
were made.

Please also note that I will be out of the office tomorrow, so I will make 
the shortname changes in GCP this evening, after 5:p.  ERMS IT will make its 
changes tomorrow morning, Friday, March 16.

Records will be inactivated on April 2, 2001. 

We have made a few changes to our Name Change/Merger Notification Report - it 
now has a new look and a couple of features we hope will assist you.  For 
more information, please click below:


Each month now has two sheets, a summary sheet (eg Jan 01 Changes) and a 
detailed sheet (eg Jan 01).
Click below for more information:

The summary sheet can be used to view all changes after a certain date.  If 
you're aware of all changes up to, say, January 15th enter 01/16/2001 in cell 
C6 of the Summary Sheet and click the Sort button in cell H6.  All changes 
made to the report on or after January 16th will be listed automatically.
The Summary sheet may also be sorted for certain criteria - use the drop down 
arrows alongside the column headers to make your selection.

This sheet contains all the information you are used to seeing, but slightly 
reformatted.  Key points are: 
In the case of an Inactivation, the cause of the Inactivation (eg Merger) is 
listed in the Comments section
As with the previous format, 
all months' reports will be sent cumulatively throughout the year
the report will be sent out twice each month, on the 15th and at the end of 
the month.


It is our aim to publish the report in Livelink and to send out only the 
summary sheet and a URL for the detailed report each month.  This will save a 
lot of space in Lotus Notes and we hope it will streamline your monitoring 
process.

We'd be very happy to receive any comments you may have."

Please note 
that the most recent overlays are on top because unlike the others, prior 
notification has not been given.  These were just done last night and this 
morning.  For the complete report, go to the bottom tab, ""March 2001"".

The shortname changes will be coordinated with ERMS IT today, Fri, 03/23/01.

Records will be inactivated on Mon, April 2, 2001.

FYI - On the Feb 2001 report, there were several PG&E entities that went 
through name changes to El Paso entities.  There were also 3 TECO 
conversions.  We did not have the documentation to support those changes, as 
noted on the report.  As of 03/22/01, all documentation for those changes are 
in hand.

Regarding the Coastal/El Paso merger, the documents that support name changes 
as a result of that merger, have been received.  If you are interested in 
more details regarding the remaining entities, they are attached below.

We have made a few changes to our Name Change/Merger Notification Report - it 
now has a new look and a couple of features we hope will assist you.  For 
more information, please click below:


Each month now has two sheets, a summary sheet (eg Jan 01 Changes) and a 
detailed sheet (eg Jan 01).
Click below for more information:

The summary sheet can be used to view all changes after a certain date.  If 
you're aware of all changes up to, say, January 15th enter 01/16/2001 in cell 
C6 of the Summary Sheet and click the Sort button in cell H6.  All changes 
made to the report on or after January 16th will be listed automatically.
The Summary sheet may also be sorted for certain criteria - use the drop down 
arrows alongside the column headers to make your selection.

This sheet contains all the information you are used to seeing, but slightly 
reformatted.  Key points are: 
In the case of an Inactivation, the cause of the Inactivation (eg Merger) is 
listed in the Comments section
As with the previous format, 
all months' reports will be sent cumulatively throughout the year
the report will be sent out twice each month, on the 15th and at the end of 
the month.


It is our aim to publish the report in Livelink and to send out only the 
summary sheet and a URL for the detailed report each month.  This will save a 
lot of space in Lotus Notes and we hope it will streamline your monitoring 
process.

We'd be very happy to receive any comments you may have.  

Please call if there are questions or concerns.

,03/29/2001,,stephanie.piwetz@enron.com,kate.symes@enron.com,,Re: APS/Pinnacle West,"Hello Kate,
APS and Pinnacle...We ran into a problem checking out for the end of the 
month, because a few deals had Pinnacle in the system, but Bloomberg on the 
bro confirm.  We had to ch them to match the broker confirms, because APS 
showed the deals as APS on there side.  They are trying to segregate 
companies little by little.  We have been told by Rhonda, our contract 
administrator that trading under both names are legally correct, both are 
under WSPP.  

DeeDee from Pinnacle said all trades are with Pinnacle unless Bloomberg 
trade; then cp should be APS.  DeeDee said shortly all trades will be under 
Pinnacle, but did not give me a specific date.       

Please let the traders know that all trades should be with Pinnacle West, and 
APS that are transacted with Bloomberg.  No, we will not have problems 
recognizing the old name, Rhonda says they will just be assigned over to 
Pinnacle, but we will not have to revise confirms.  Hope this helps!
Thanks

Per the March 2001 report, this entity converted to a limited liability 
company.    We did not receive any documentation at that time.  Ten days 
later, it converted again to a limited partnership.  Per our normal 
procedures, a new record was created for the limited partnership.  The ""Inc"" 
record was to be inactivated on 04/02/01.  In the meantime, a legal opinion 
was issued to state that this should be treated as a name change and that an 
overlay should be done.  I have overlayed the ""Inc"" record with ""LP"", and the 
newly created LP record, CP ID 93330 will be inactivated.

additions to the report since Jan. 15.  
Please note that:
 ERMS short names will be changed in GCP and ERMS each Friday at 10am Central 
Time, and 
 Inactivations will be made on Feb 1

For more information, please click below:


Each month now has two sheets, a summary sheet (eg Jan 01 Changes) and a 
detailed sheet (eg Jan 01).
Click below for more information:

The summary sheet can be used to view all changes after a certain date.  If 
you're aware of all changes up to, say, January 15th enter 01/16/2001 in cell 
C6 of the Summary Sheet and click the Sort button in cell H6.  All changes 
made to the report on or after January 16th will be listed automatically.
The Summary sheet may also be sorted for certain criteria - use the drop down 
arrows alongside the column headers to make your selection.

This sheet contains all the information you are used to seeing, but slightly 
reformatted.  Key points are: 
In the case of an Inactivation, the cause of the Inactivation (eg Merger) is 
listed in the Comments section
As with the previous format, 
all months' reports will be sent cumulatively throughout the year
the report will be sent out twice each month, on the 15th and at the end of 
the month.


It is our aim to publish the report in Livelink and to send out only the 
summary sheet and a URL for the detailed report each month.  This will save a 
lot of space in Lotus Notes and we hope it will streamline your monitoring 
process.

We'd be very happy to receive any comments you may have."

Verado Holdings, Inc. was just completed today 04/12/01.

Please find attached the Preliminary Name Change/Merger Notification Report 
for April.  To launch the report, double click on the attachment and select 
Enable Macros and Read Only.

Please note that:
 ERMS short names will be changed in GCP and ERMS each Friday at 10am Central 
Time, and 
 Inactivations will be made on May 1

We have made a few changes to our Name Change/Merger Notification Report - it 
now has a new look and a couple of features we hope will assist you.  For 
more information, please click below:


Each month now has two sheets, a summary sheet (eg Jan 01 Changes) and a 
detailed sheet (eg Jan 01).
Click below for more information:

The summary sheet can be used to view all changes after a certain date.  If 
you're aware of all changes up to, say, January 15th enter 01/16/2001 in cell 
C6 of the Summary Sheet and click the Sort button in cell H6.  All changes 
made to the report on or after January 16th will be listed automatically.
The Summary sheet may also be sorted for certain criteria - use the drop down 
arrows alongside the column headers to make your selection.

This sheet contains all the information you are used to seeing, but slightly 
reformatted.  Key points are: 
In the case of an Inactivation, the cause of the Inactivation (eg Merger) is 
listed in the Comments section
As with the previous format, 
all months' reports will be sent cumulatively throughout the year
the report will be sent out twice each month, on the 15th and at the end of 
the month.


It is our aim to publish the report in Livelink and to send out only the 
summary sheet and a URL for the detailed report each month.  This will save a 
lot of space in Lotus Notes and we hope it will streamline your monitoring 
process.

We'd be very happy to receive any comments you may have."

IT TAGG - Please note that short name changes will come from the Jan 2001 
report AND Feb 2001 report.  I will begin making the changes tomorrow at 10:a 
as usual.

The font and page size for this report has been reduced but feel free to 
change the page set up as needed.  The reason the report is set up on A4 
paper is that A4 prints automatically anywhere in the world.  Legal paper 
isn't readily available everywhere, so this format is the best compromise."

April 2001.  To launch the report, double click on the attachment and select 
Enable Macros and Read Only.
Please note that:
 ERMS short names will be changed in GCP and ERMS each Friday at 10am Central 
Time, and 
 Inactivations will be made on May 1

We have made a few changes to our Name Change/Merger Notification Report - it 
now has a new look and a couple of features we hope will assist you.  For 
more information, please click below:


Each month now has two sheets, a summary sheet (eg Jan 01 Changes) and a 
detailed sheet (eg Jan 01).
Click below for more information:

The summary sheet can be used to view all changes after a certain date.  If 
you're aware of all changes up to, say, January 15th enter 01/16/2001 in cell 
C6 of the Summary Sheet and click the Sort button in cell H6.  All changes 
made to the report on or after January 16th will be listed automatically.
The Summary sheet may also be sorted for certain criteria - use the drop down 
arrows alongside the column headers to make your selection.

This sheet contains all the information you are used to seeing, but slightly 
reformatted.  Key points are: 
In the case of an Inactivation, the cause of the Inactivation (eg Merger) is 
listed in the Comments section
As with the previous format, 
all months' reports will be sent cumulatively throughout the year
the report will be sent out twice each month, on the 15th and at the end of 
the month.


It is our aim to publish the report in Livelink and to send out only the 
summary sheet and a URL for the detailed report each month.  This will save a 
lot of space in Lotus Notes and we hope it will streamline your monitoring 
process.

The following are revisions to the final report for April 2001.  I am 
providing details here, and the updated report is also attached.  

Tom Brown Resources Ltd., CP ID 96309 is the result of an amalgamation with 
Stellarton Energy Corporation, CP ID 64040.  Stellarton Energy Corporation 
will be inactivated on 05/01/01.  Have Certificate of Amalgamation and 
Articles of Amalgamation in hand.

Please also note that the Western Area Power Administration-""Upper Great 
Plain"" record, CP ID 81177, will be corrected to read ""Western Area Power 
Administration-""Upper Great Plains Region"".  The record that was overlayed 
per the report, CP ID 35194, will be inactivated as a duplicate record.  
These changes have been included on this revised report and the changes have 
been made in GCP today.  These are branch locations by geographic area of the 
US Dept. of Energy, and there is no documentation for these changes.

I have also just received a name correction that may as well be included in 
this report -
      From Greer Comm. of Public Works, CP ID 36393, to Commission of Public 
Works, City of Greer




Please call me with any questions or concerns.

These two deals are in as the wrong counterparty.  I am asking Rhonda to 
inactivate this name so he won't keep using it.  I think it is a real long, 
involved name starting with ""the"" rather than city of Oakland.  Go figure how 
someone alphabetizes!  Can you check into this.

- 	On November 5, 2001, PSEG Energy Resources & Trade filed a complaint against the New York Independent System Operator, Inc. (NYISO), requesting that the Commission restore the original market clearing prices for energy for May 9, 2000.  PSEG claims that NYISO violated its tariff and Commission orders approving Temporary Extraordinary Procedure (TEP) authority by 1) identifying a purported market flaw associated with bids submitted by an Energy Limited Resource and 2) remedying the market flaw by re-pricing certain hourly clearing prices in a manner inconsistent with its tariff on May 8 & 9, 2000.  PSEG was a seller in the real time market on May 9, 2000 and lost revenues as a result of NYISO's Extraordinary Corrective Action.
Interventions and protests are due by November 26, 2001. (EL02-16-000)

-	On November 16, 2001, NYISO filed a request for a stay of the Commission's decision to require the NYISO to re-bill for operating reserves for March 2000, pending the NYISO's appeal of that decision.  In March 2000, NYISO made an ""exigent circumstances"" filing seeking the imposition of various bidding restrictions to prevent alleged market power abuses.  The Commission's order only partially granted NYISO's request, and did not allow NYISO to re-calculate March 2000 operating reserves prices.
The Commission has not yet issued any notice of the filing.

The facilities are the transmission assets in the Eastern Division of Rockland's service territory.  This includes approximately 400 MW of load in Bergen County, NJ and transmission facilities that are already directly interconnected with PJM (note that other Rockland facilities located in NJ, namely those in northern Passaic County and Sussex County (Rockland's Central and Western Divisions respectively) will not be transferred to PJM and will remain under the operational control of the NYISO since these facilities are not directly interconnected with PJM nor with Rockland's Eastern Division).  The filing requests approval of the transfer by November 30, 2001 which would allow PJM to take operational control on February 1, 2002 (the filing does not address what, if any, changes to the operation date might be if FERC does not approve this by Nov 30).  Rockland Electric is a subsidiary of Orange & Rockland Utilities which is a subsidiary of Con Edison.

The transfer adds approximately 400 MW of load and 56,000 customers (mostly residential and commercial) to PJM.  There is no increase in supply, therefore the total load of PJM is increased by 400 MW without any additional resources.  The transmission assets include 138-kV (8.3 miles), 69-kV (35.9 miles) and 35-kV (12.4 miles) transmission lines and 11 substations (the filing includes a detailed description of these assets).

Let me know if you require any additional information."

NYISO TEP and Bid Cap (ER01-3001):  Commission granted NYISO's request to extend the currently effective $1000/MWh Bid Caps on certain NYISO adminstered markets, and to extend its Temporary Extraordinary Procedures for Correcting Market Design Flaws and Addressing Transitional Abnormalities, until the Northeastern RTO is operational.  The Commission ordered NYISO to narrow the scope of the TEP, and to file tariff sheets doing so within 30 days.  

NYISO proposed virtual bidding procedures (ER01-3009; ER01-3153):  Tariff changes to implement virtual bidding were approved.  The changes would allow market participants to bid non-physical generation and load into the day-ahead market and settle the bids in the real-time market.  Also accepted were NYISOs Market Mitigation Measures to address gaming or market power strategies that might emerge as a result of the virtual bidding.

NYISO - Cost responsibility for new interconnections.  (ER01-2967):  Tariff changes allocating cost responsibility for interconnection facilities.  The provisions allocate to developers 100% of the cost of facilities necessary to physically interconnect the project.  Additionally, developers are allocated the coswts for transmission system upgrades that would not have been made ""but for"" the interconnection, minus the cost of any facilities that the NYISO's regional plan dictates would have been necessary anyway for load growth and reliability purposes.  

ISO-NE - Interim Bid Caps (ER01-3086):  Commission approved extension of bid caps until the Northeastern RTO is operational.

Calpine v. ISO-NE (EL01-124):  Commission granted complaint by Calpine and Mirant, finding that ISO-NE has amended Market Rule 5 to exclude external contracts from setting the energy clearing price, in violation of a Commission order.

,12/01/2001,,no.address@enron.com,,,UPDATE - Reporting to Work Next Week,"Many of you have asked whether you should come into the office next week, especially if there is no guarantee of being paid for time worked after today.  We want to encourage you to come to work.  We continue to consider every option available to us as a company; and unfortunately, restructuring through bankruptcy is one of those options.  Your continued efforts during these trying times are critical to the company as we go through this decision making process.

I still cannot say with certainty if or when we will file for bankruptcy.  But you should be aware that, in general, the bankruptcy code provides protection for employee salaries and wages earned within 90 days of a petition filing to the extent of $4,650 per employee.  I want you to know that if we file a bankruptcy petition, we intend to seek approval by the bankruptcy court to exercise that protection immediately and pay you for your time worked prior to any petition filing according to our regular payroll practices.  Additionally, Enron would be obligated and will pay salaries and wages earned after a bankruptcy filing. For Enron, where our value is directly tied to our employees, making sure that we meet these obligations will be a high priority.

We are continuing to evaluate the ongoing resource needs of the company for each potential option we might pursue.  Of course, until we finalize those business decisions, we cannot make that determination.  I know that this prolonged process is agonizing for you.  I can only continue to assure you that we will notify you of your employment status as soon as we are able to do so.

While terminated employees will tap into their own network of contacts as they look for new employment, we hope to do what we can to assist them.  We will tap into the contacts we have as a company to aid terminated employees in their job search.  We have already been in touch with several employers and many are interested in Enron alumni.  We will share more information on these efforts soon.

I appreciate your continued patience and cooperation.

,11/30/2001,,no.address@enron.com,,,PLEASE READ - IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR PARTICIPANTS IN THE ENRON --  --  SAVINGS PLAN,"Due to current business circumstances, on November 28, 2001, Enron's Board of Directors adopted an amendment to the Enron Corp. Savings Plan.  The amendment includes the following changes, which became effective on November 29:

?	Savings Plan contributions that are deducted from your November 30 paycheck will be matched by Enron in cash rather than Enron stock.  The cash match will be placed into the Fidelity Freedom 2000 fund, the default fund for the Plan.  

?	After November 30, Enron will no longer match your savings plan contributions.  As an exception, the company will continue the union matching contributions to the Plan.

?	The Savings Plan has always permitted employees to place their contributions in Enron stock or one or more alternative investment options.  Effective immediately, diversification within the Plan will ALSO be allowed, regardless of your age, from COMPANY contribution accounts.  This removes the restriction for all employees under the age of 50 to diversify the company contributions held in their account.  These accounts include all prior company contributions, QNEC, and company match accounts.  

To move funds:
On the Web, choose ""Savings Plan--Restricted Employer Acct Transfer/Reallocation"" from the drop down menu.
On Voice Response, choose ""request for fund transfer/reallocation of your restricted employer accounts.""
This will allow you to move money from the four formerly restricted accounts: Company Matching, Union Matching, Prior Matching, and QNEC.

To avoid phone delays, we recommend that you access your account through the web at http://resources.hewitt.com/enron or through benefits.enron.com."
,10/16/2001,,no.address@enron.com,,,Third Quarter Earnings Results,"Today, we announced our third quarter earnings results, which were right on target with analysts estimates for recurring earnings per diluted share of $0.43.  This marks a 26 percent increase over the third quarter of last year, which is due to the strong performance of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural gas pipelines.  In addition, we also announced that we are on track for our earnings target of $0.45 for the fourth quarter ($1.80 for 2001) and $2.15 for 2002.

We made a commitment to you that we would provide you with timely information about Enron's business strategy and performance, so this email is intended to provide an explanation about our earnings this quarter.

Over the past few months, we have met with analysts to discuss Enron's performance.  We received considerable feedback from investors and analysts that we needed to expand our financial reporting to include details for more of our business units.  In response to that feedback, we have provided results separately for several of our business units.  For example, while we have provided volume figures for North America and Europe, this is the first quarter we have provided financials separately for Enron Americas and for Europe and Other Commodities.  In addition, information about our global assets had previously been included in our numbers for Wholesale Services.  This quarter they are reported separately.   Finally, even though our broadband business is now part of Enron Wholesale Services, we are continuing to report that business separately.

Following are the highlights of our businesses:

Wholesale Services: Total income before interest, minority interests and taxes (IBIT) increased 28% to $754 million in the third quarter.  Total wholesale physical volumes increased 65% to 88.2 trillion British thermal units equivalent per day (Tbtue/d).
Americas: IBIT increased 31% to $701 million.  Natural gas volumes increased 6% to 26.7 Tbtu/d, and power volumes increased 77% to 290 million megawatt hours (MWh).
Europe and Other Commodity Markets: IBIT remained unchanged at $53 million as compared to last year.  While physical gas and power volumes increased, low volatility in these markets caused profitability to remain flat.

Retail Services: Enron Energy Services reported IBIT of $71 million, compared to $27 million a year ago.  So far this year, EES has completed more than 50 transactions with large customers and more than 95,000 deals with small business customers.


Transportation and Distribution:
	Natural Gas Pipelines: IBIT increased slightly to $85 million in the third quarter.
Portland General: We reported an IBIT loss of $(17) million this quarter compared to IBIT of $74 million a year ago.  This loss is due to power contracts PGE entered into at prices that were significantly higher than actual settled prices during the third quarter.  Last week, we  announced an agreement to sell PGE to Northwest Natural.  This transaction is expected to close next year.
Global Assets: This segment includes Elektro, Dabhol, TGS, Azurix and Enron Wind.  Third quarter IBIT remained unchanged at $19 million compared to last year.

Broadband Services: IBIT losses were $(80) million in the current quarter compared to a $(20) million loss last year.  This quarter's results include significantly lower investment-related income and lower operating costs.

Corporate and other: This segment includes the unallocated expenses associated with general corporate functions. This segment reported an IBIT loss of $(59) million compared to $(106) million a year ago.

In addition, this quarter we announced one-time charges of $1.01 billion.  Over the past few quarters, we have conducted a thorough  review of our businesses and have decided to take certain charges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential  of our core businesses.  These charges include:
?	A $287 million write-down of Azurix Corp.
?	$183 million associated with the restructuring of Broadband Services.  This includes severance costs, a loss on the sale of inventory like servers and routers, and a write-down of the value of our content services contracts due to the bankruptcy of a number of customers.
?	$544 million related to losses from certain investments, primarily Enron's interest in The New Power Company, broadband and technology investments and early termination of a structured finance arrangement.  

With our announcements this quarter we accomplished three things:  1) we showed continued strong earnings and earnings growth in our core businesses, 2) we cleared away those things that were clouding this superb performance in our core businesses, and 3) We expanded our reporting of financial results to increase transparency for our investors.

Here are the banner ads.  I'm not sure I'm totally sold on them, however, it is important we get the ads going.  Personally, I think they are a little to alike and EnronOnline is too small.  Also, on the last banner, should we promote the Bal of Day instead of Bal of Mo. ?  If you want, I'll step up to the desk and we can discuss.

The volume on the hedge will now respect the minimum volume and volume increment settings on the parent product. See rules below: 

?	If the transaction volume on the child is less than half of the parent's minimum volume no hedge will occur.
?	If the transaction volume on the child is more than half the parent's minimum volume but less than half the volume increment on the parent, the hedge will volume will be the parent's minimum volume.
?	For all other volumes, the same rounding rules will apply based on the volume increment on the parent product.

Please see example below:

Parent's Settings:
Minimum: 	5000
Increment:  1000

Stack Manager Modifications

Inactivate All Stack - In addition to the individual Activate/Inactive Stack buttons, there is now an Inactivate All Stack button. Similar to the Suspend All button, this button will inactivate the trader's stack on all active products. Any existing top of stack limit orders will continue to post to the website and remain transactable. See screen shot below: Inactivate All Stack button on far right. 

	 

Please note that we have switched the positions of the suspend and inactivate buttons in Stack Manager.

Fill Order - If a product is set up as either Restricted Top of Stack or Top of Stack the trader now has the ability to automatically fill any order that is at the top of the stack. In order to fill a limit order that is at the top of the product's stack, which will appear in pink, the trader should right click anywhere on the stack window and choose ""Fill order"". The volume filled on an order will be that which is offered by the trader. In order to fill the complete volume of the order, the trader will need to adjust the volume in his stack.

Floated Stack windows - If the stack is inactive on a product, the price and volume fields on the my products tab will continue to be blank. On the depth window and floated stack window of these products the trader's prices will be in gray and italics. Children of products that have inactive stacks will not be gray and italicised in the floated stack windows and will not see the calculated prices.

No Auto Inactivate Stack - It is now possible to keep a product active even if the trader is not logged into Stack Manager. If the trader wishes to enable this functionality on the upper right corner of the product properties page the trader should choose ""No Auto Inactivate when Stack Manager is down"". 

Changes regarding Suspension of products

Stack Manager will inactivate products rather than suspend them in the following cases:

?	Market Close - If a product is active at the end of its trading hours its stack will automatically become inactive rather than suspending. In order to keep a product's stack active past the set trading hours, the trader should choose ""Keep Awake"" next to the trading hours section of the product properties page.
?	Auto Suspend now inactivates stack - On a product with the Auto Suspend function enabled to monitor the price changes on the product, the product's stack will be inactivated if the Suspend at level is reached. This feature can be used by checking the Enable box on the product properties page under the Auto Suspend section. 
?	Logging Out of Stack Manager- When you log out of Stack Manager without inactivating or suspending your products, the system will now inactivate your products rather than suspending them."

On Day 1 of operation, PJM West will be the Allegheny control area only.  Work is progressing on Duquesne and the earliest date I have heard for integration of Duquesne into PJM West is sometime in the 1st quarter of 2002.  PJM West and PJM proper will be integrated such that there is one energy market (day-ahead and real-time) across the entire region, based on LMP, and no pancaking of transmission rates (pay the rate of the transmission system at point of withdrawal just as is done in PJM today).  However, there will be two different capacity markets - ICAP in PJM and ACAP in PJM West - to reflect the difference in reliability standards of the two NERC regions.

PJM has recently announced PJM West market trials for the Day-Ahead market on Nov 21 and Nov 28.  Real-time energy market trials are scheduled to be conducted starting on Nov 26 and continuing through Dec 31.  For additional information regarding the market trial see the enclosed notice from PJM."

These changes are outlined below and will be visible by all as of Monday September 3, 2001.


Stack Manager Changes

Activate/Inactivate Stack - This functionality allows the trader to pull a product's prices from the website without suspending the product. If the Top of Stack limit order functionality is activated for a particular product this should be used to pull the stack prices from the website without pulling the entire product; therefore, if there are top of stack limit orders against the product they will remain visible and transactable on the website. 

If a product's stack is inactivated the font for that product will be grayed out in stack manager. If the stack is active it will appear in black font.

To use this feature, select the product, right click and choose ""Inactivate Stack"". When you are ready to reactivate your prices, select the same product, right click again and choose ""Activate Stack"". There are also icons on the tool bar at the top of your screen which will Activate/Inactivate the stack of the highlighted product. See screen shot below for the icons.

					 

Changes to Product Properties - Currently when modifications are made to certain properties within the product properties screen, the product will be suspended and pulled from the website. Now instead of being suspended, the product's stack will become inactive. Once the changes have been made and saved to the properties of a product simply click the Activate Stack icon as discussed above.


Website Change

Restrictions on Top of Stack orders - If Top of Stack limit orders are allowed on a product, but the trader is not showing both a bid and offer, limit orders will not be able to be placed on that product.

( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) Kinder Morgan Plans 5,500MW of New Power
Generation, in an Advisory by Industrialinfo.com

    Business/Energy Editors

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Aug. 30, 2001--The following is an
advisory by Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources Inc.:
Houston, Texas). Kinder Morgan Power Company, a subsidiary of Kinder
Morgan Inc. (NYSE:KMI) (Houston, Texas), is quickly emerging as a
powerful force in the race to power America. The company's power
development program calls for the construction of ten natural
gas-fired generation plants that represent approximately 5,500
mega-watts (MW) of intermediate power. Williams Energy Services will
provide fuel to the plants and marketing of the new generation
capacity. The first two plants will begin generating in the summer of
2002, with the remaining plants in commercial operation by 2005.
	   The company has secured agreements with General Electric (GE) and
Deltac to provide turbines and heat recovery steam generators
respectively, for all the plants. Research by Industrialinfo.com
outlines each of the ten projects being engineered, under construction
and in the startup phase.
	   Kinder Morgan was founded in 1936 and began developing natural
gas-fired power generation plants in 1998. KMI is one of the largest
mid-stream energy companies in America, operating more than 30,000
miles of natural gas and product pipelines across the United States.
	   For more information on trends and upcoming construction
activities in the Power and Energy markets as well as other industrial
sectors send inquiries to powergroup@industrialinfo.com or visit us at

with respect to its unilateral modification of Market Rule 5 and Appendix 5-C of the
New England Power Pool (NEPOOL) FERC Electric Rate Schedule No. 6, through which ISO-NE has excluded external energy contracts from its calculation of the Energy Clearing Price since September 1, 2001.
Interventions in this proceeding are due this week; please let me know immediately whether we have a specific interest.  In any event, I will circulate an update of any FERC action on the complaint.

Some of these changes will affect Stack Manager while others affect the Website. A summary of these changes is listed below.

Stack Manager Changes

Top of Stack limit orders - This feature will allow the price submitted via limit orders to be displayed on the website if their bid or offer is better than the trader's stack price. Stack Manger will list the price and the names of counterparties submitting such orders on the  floated stack window.  Orders will be queued by price and time stamp. When a counterparty trades on a "" Top of Stack Entry"" it will create back to back transactions; one between Enron and the counterparty submitting the order, and the other between Enron and the counterparty clicking on the website.

In order to turn on this functionality select the "" Allowed Top of Stack"" option, in the Orders section of the product properties page.  If regular limit order functionality is desired the ""Allowed""  option should be selected.

Please note that this feature will be released in a disabled mode and will be turned on sometime next week after determining which business units want to roll this out.

Restricted Top of Stack limit orders - This feature will allow the price submitted only by internal traders via limit orders to be displayed on the website if their bid or offer is better than the trader's stack price. Stack Manger will list price and the names of counterparties submitting such orders on the  floated stack window.  Orders will be queued by price and time stamp. When a counterparty trades on a "" Top of Stack Entry"" it will create back to back transactions one between Enron and the counterparty submitting the order, and the other between Enron and the counterparty clicking on the website.

In order to turn on this functionality select the "" allowed as Restricted Top of Stack"" option, in the Orders section of the product properties page.  If regular limit order functionality is desired the ""Allowed""  option should be selected. If a product has active orders against it you will not be able to select the ""Restricted Top of Stack"" feature.

Advanced Filtering Ability on All Products Tab -  Drop down filtering capability is now available for each field in the All Products tab in stack manager. In order to filter click on the arrow next to the field title. A drop down box with a list of attributes will appear. Highlight the attribute by which you wish to filter. To turn off the filter click on the arrow and select the "" All"" option from the drop down box.


Website Changes

New Submission Screen for Restricted Top of Stack Limit Orders -  The submission screen for  products that allow  Top of Stack or Restricted Top of Stack limit orders is as follows.
 

The submit button on the left makes a submission for a normal transaction, while the button on the right will submit as a limit order.  In case of the Restricted Top of Stack limit orders only internal traders will see the new submission box. 

Price of Limit Orders 

Modify Limit Orders
 Customers now have the ability to modify the price of any active order. In order to do so highlight the order to be modified and use the plus or minus sign next to the price field on  at the top of the ""Today's Orders"" section. The price will move up or down in the same increments as the tick size for that product. Once the price is at the desired level click the ""Set"" button and the price will be modified. Another way to modify the price on a limit order is to click on the price field on a particular limit order.  You will see a box with plus, minus and set buttons that allow you to modify that order.

Expiration time for Limit Orders
Customers can now place limit orders with expiration times of up to 30 days. Currently they may place orders for only up to 12 hours.

Float the Today's Orders Section
You can now float the "" Limit Order "" section. In order to do so, right click in the ""Today's Orders "" section and select the float window option. In order to make the window "" Stay On Top "" right click on the floated window and select the stay on top option.

Mid Market Client - Mid market originators will now have the ability to transact on behalf of their customers, while including their desired margin on the trade, on EnronOnline products. In order to do so Click on the bid or offer price, a customised submission window will appear.  Select the counterparty for whom you wish to transact from a drop down list , enter the desired customer price and margin and click submit. For example if a customer wants to buy Nymex Sep 01 at 3.36 and you wish to have a 1 cent margin, please enter 3.36 as the desired price and 0.01 as the margin. The system will trade the order when the EnronOnline offer for Nymex Sep 01 is at 3.35, book the trade at 3.36 and record the 0.01 origination amount.

In order to be set up to use this functionality. Please call the EnronOnline Product Control Group.

Changes to Website Passwords - As an added security measure, which has been requested by many customers, some new password rules have been instituted. First, the password cannot be equal to the login ID. Second, each user will be prompted to change his password every 90 days. These rules apply to all website passwords for both internal and external users.


Please note  Stack Manager changes will be available all traders as of Monday August 20, 2001. The changes to the website will be rolled out to a few internal users on Monday with the rest of the internal users being upgraded Monday night, and external users by the end of the week.  Over the next couple of weeks all users will be prompted to change their website passwords.

If you have any questions regarding these changes please contact me at 713-853-1787.

,08/15/2001,,40enron@enron.com,,,Organizational Announcement,"It is with regret that I have to announce that Jeff Skilling is leaving Enron.  Today, the Board of Directors accepted his resignation as President and CEO of Enron.  Jeff is resigning for personal reasons and his decision is voluntary.  I regret his decision, but I accept and understand it.  I have worked closely with Jeff for more than 15 years, including 11 here at Enron, and have had few, if any, professional relationships that I value more.  I am pleased to say that he has agreed to enter into a consulting arrangement with the company to advise me and the Board of Directors.
Now it's time to look forward.
With Jeff leaving, the Board has asked me to resume the responsibilities of President and CEO in addition to my role as Chairman of the Board.  I have agreed.  I want to assure you that I have never felt better about the prospects for the company.  All of you know that our stock price has suffered substantially over the last few months.  One of my top priorities will be to restore a significant amount of the stock value we have lost as soon as possible.  Our performance has never been stronger; our business model has never been more robust; our growth has never been more certain; and most importantly, we have never had a better nor deeper pool of talent throughout the company.  We have the finest organization in American business today.  Together, we will make Enron the world's leading company.
On Thursday at 10:00 a.m. Houston time, we will hold an all employee meeting at the Hyatt.  We will broadcast the meeting to our employees around the world where technically available, and I look forward to seeing many of you there."

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new building and are currently parking in an Enron Contract garage or on the parking waitlist you are being offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.

This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly employee cost of $94.00.

If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made as spaces become available. 

The  Sky Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street level entrance to Enron Center North until  Sky Ring access is available. Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an exit in the event of elevator trouble. 

If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and receive a parking transponder along with a an information packet for the new garage.

The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions."

,10/19/2001,,no.address@enron.com,,,UPDATE - Supported Internet Email Addresses,"Earlier this week, Enron Global Technology announced the plan to decommission the use of all non-standard Internet Email address formats. As mentioned in the previous communication, this was the first of several communications to be sent by the Enron Global Technology group and we will continue to provide more details in the coming weeks regarding this significant but necessary change to our Email environment.
 
We are working toward a cut-off date of January 14, 2002, at which time we will no longer support Email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname.lastname@enron.com (or firstname.middleinitial.lastname@enron.com if your name in Lotus Notes or Outlook has a middle initial in it). We understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard Email address format, but it is important to begin making the change now.
 
If you have questions, please send an Email to Enron.Messaging.Administration@enron.com.
 
Thank you for your support.

As part of the merger, NSP transferred its existing utility operations that were being conducted directly by NSP at the parent company level to a newly formed subsidiary of Xcel Energy named Northern States Power Company.

Because of the merger, the record was overlayed in Global Counterparty and all history for Northern States Power Company is now under Xcel Energy.  A new Northern States Power Company record has been created in Global.  I will be moving all Xcel deals with a July 1, 2001 forward flow date to the newly created record for Northern States Power Company.  Xcel Energy will be inactivated in Enpower.  

Please choose Northern States Power Company (NORTHERNST) for future deals with this counterparty."

Day 4 - October 18, 2001

Afternoon Session

 

Standardizing Markets, Business, and Other Practices 

Panelists for this discussion were:  Sarah Barpoulis, PG&E National Energy Group; William P. Boswell, GISB; Bill Burkes (substituting for David J. Christiano), City Utilities of Springfield, Missouri; David N. Cook, NERC General Counsel; Michael Kormos PJM Interconnection; LeRoy Koppendrayer, Minnesota Public Utilities Commission; and Marty Mennes, Florida Power & Light Company.

 


General Observations


 

The Commissioners were all present the majority of the time (Massey left late in the  afternoon).  FERC Staff was active in the discussion; however, the commissioners were very active as well, asking perhaps as much as 70% of all questions.  There was a general consensus that standards were needed; much discussion focused simply on how much and by who. The Commission seemed very interested in leaning what they needed to do to move the industry forward and how far they needed to go.  Panelists urged the need to mover forward as quickly as possible, but both they and FERC seemed to recognize that some of the issues regarding standardized market design and such needed to be addressed before RTOs could really begin to move forward.  There was discussion on identifying which industry group (NERC or GISB) would take the reins in the future.  On an interesting tangential note, there was noticeable conflict between NERC and GISB, with veiled insults between the two organizations somewhat common during the discussions. 

 


FERC Deliverables


A great deal of the discussions focused on identifying what the industry needed from the Commission.  Staffers probed all panelists to find what they felt was critical.  

The first major topic was ""How many RTOs?  What is their scope?""  All panelists seemed to agree that this question needed to be answered immediately by FERC, in strong definitive language.  N o one offered any specific language, but seemed to be urging FERC to issue a formal statement.

The next topic was, ""What will be standard market design?""  Panelists varied on this, but most felt strong guidance from FERC is urgent.  Some urged for one mandatory design for North America, one supported a set of rigid standard designs, one supported a single design with requests for exceptions (followed by an in-depth review process), and one seemed to prefer the current situation.

The commission in general seemed to be very interested in understanding what the industry needed to move forward.  They continually visited this topic throughout their discussions, asking questions like, ""Do we need to issue a Mega-Order that addresses all these issues?"" and, ""How much detail do you need us to provide?""   General feel from the panelsists seemed to be they wanted strong leadership in this areas.  Kormos and Burkes went so far as to say FERC should ""Mandate as much as they felt comfortable - and then go a little further.""  Others seemed to be a little worried about this idea, but in general did not oppose the concept, citing only general warnings and the need for cautious investigation.  

One item of interest: Wood referred to the filing made by the Electronic Scheduling Collaborative and specifically asked if the items identified in the ""RTO Design and RTO Implementation"" section would address many of the questions and uncertainty facing the industry with regard to RTO design.  Kormos indicated that clear and specific answers to these questions specifying a course of action would go a long way toward guiding the industry.  The section to which Wood referred was one that I wrote, and asked the following questions:


?         Congestion Management - When Operational Security Violations occur, how is the system to be stabilized in a fair and equitable manner that is nonetheless efficient?  Will LMP based systems be standard, or will there be others that must be accommodated?


?         Transmission Service  - Are transmission services required to schedule (""covered"" schedules only), or are they risk management tools protecting from congestion charges (both ""covered"" and ""uncovered"" schedules are allowed)? 


?         Loop Flows  - Are contract-path based or flow-based transmission services appropriate?  If contract-path based, how are parallel path issues to be addressed?


?         Grandfathered Transmission Service - Should contracts existing prior to RTO development be transferred, or is there an equitable way to retire those contracts?  Are there other solutions?


?         Energy Imbalance Markets - How are imbalance markets to function? Will they serve as real-time energy markets (support unbalanced schedules), be limited to supplying needs of imbalance service (require balanced schedules), or will they be required at all?


?         Ancillary Services - Will ancillary service markets be developed in standard ways?  Will entities be required to actually schedule ancillary services (required to schedule), or will they be treated primarily as financial instruments (protecting against real-time POLR charges)?


?         Losses - Can we utilize the imbalance markets to support losses?  Can we create specific loss standards that facilitate the scheduling process, or must we support methods that are currently in tariffs, but technically unwieldy?


?         Non-Jurisdictionals - How are non-jurisdictionals to be integrated into the new world?  Should systems be designed with the assumption that non-jurisdictional will be part of an RTO?  Or should they be designed to treat each NJE as a separate entity?


Hopefully, FERC will use this section as a template to answer these critical questions in an assertive manner, and give some solid direction in which to move. Kormos emphasized the need for concrete answers to these questions, pointing out that vague answers (i.e., ""do congestion management"") will take a year or two to resolve, but specific answers (i.e., ""LMP with financial hedging instruments"") will take only months.  The Commission asked Mike about moving forward, and he told them that effectively, it was impossible to move forward with implementation without getting these issues addressed.

Now for a  funny point - One of the commissioners (I think Breathitt) referred to some concerns expressed in the Northwest that their high concentration of hydro power makes LMP inefficient for the Northwest.  Kormos flat out said, ""My profession is understanding how power systems work, and I don't believe that that statement is true.""  He then backpedaled a bit and said that it would need more study, but he stood by his statement that the assertion by the Northwest interests was false.


NERC and GISB


A great deal of discussion focused around the need for a single standard-setting organization.  Massey went so far as to ask, ""Are we looking at a beauty contest between NERC and GISB?""  Cook and Boswell then went into several short polite jabs at each other's organizations.  Other participants continually reiterated the need for ONE, INDEPENDENT organization.  Interestingly, Boswell was very emphatic about the established trust and respect in GISB, while Cook preferred to only talk about the ""new"" structure of NERC and did not focus on its history.

Brownell offered some not-too-subtle passive support of GISB by pointedly asking both Cook and Boswell if they lobbied political positions (i.e., were they not only an organization but also a stakeholder?).  GISB was easily able to say they were not, but NERC of course had to admit to their romancing of Congress and the Bush administration for reliability legislation. Point, Brownell.

Mennes acted as somewhat of a supporter for NERC, playing Dave Cook's yes-man.  He probably did them a little bit of harm by pointing to NERC's supposed ""successes,"" such as TLR and E-Tag.  If staffers have tenure, they will likely remember that these ""successes"" have not been so successful, resulting in several filings and interventions.  We may also wish to file comments in specific objection to these claims, to refresh their memory and to show the pretty picture Marty painted was in fact a fiction.

There was a little discussion about splitting reliability and market issues, but general consensus was that I could not be done.  There was also some talk of folding NERC under GISB/EISB.

The arguments began winding down after a some time, and Boswell strongly urged the Commission to speak to industry executives and advocacy group leadership to see whether NERC or GISB should lead the industry forward.  NERC somewhat less enthusiastically supported this position.  In general, I would say it was a close fight but GISB came out more on top.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Tonight will mark the first night of the MHEB / Eservices Off-peak Alliance.  The Eservices group just signed a contract (a copy of which will be provided to you) effectuating an commercial agreement, where Enron will attempt to market a mutually agreed upon quantity of off-peak power outside of MAPP (including KCPL & MPS) above a MHEB determined reference price.  In addition, if you see a bid in MAPP that is greater than the reference price, let MHEB know about it.  MHEB and Eservices will share the profit(50/50) from trades done.  Also, if there is a TLR, LLR curtailment MHEB will share half the cost of the transmission loss.

Nature of deal:
This is to be a friendly lead-in deal hopefully to be cultivated into longer term deal that will allow us access to some more lucrative products. 

Transacting:
Call MHEB during the night shift and their real-time desk will tell you how many MW are available, and what the reference price will be.  If you can sell the power for more that the reference price + transmission, inform the MHEB desk and get it done.  Be careful of TLRs and ATC restrictions.

MAPPF ATC Flowgate website on MAPP Oasis: 
Under the heading ""Flowgate ATC"", select ""Non-Firm ATC"" to check the atc for flowgates ""COOPER_S"", ""FTCAL_S"", and ""PRI-BYN"".  These are the flowgates that usually cause our MAPP-F requests to be declined.

You can also check the specific path (POR to POD) under the heading ""Contract Path ATC"".

http://toinfo.oasis.mapp.org/oac/oac2/script/atcs.html


Booking:
Deal should be entered in the Eservices P&L (just like the MDEA deal) and in enpower. Do not Enpower any deals until the Book is created.

Pricing Formula.
Energy Price (paid to MHEB) = .50 (SP - Cost - RP) + RP
SP= Sales Price
RP= Reference Price (MAPP Price to beat)
Cost= All cost incurred Buy/Resale, transmission, etc.

Eservices Staff:
Kayne Coulter and JD Kinser will be the lead contacts for questions regarding this deal.  JD will be the lead in charge of MHEB during the day and will work with MHEB.  You can call either of these guys with questions as well me at any time with questions.

Kayne & I spoke with Glen Matthews today and he said that he thought that they would have some power available beginning HE 1.  Keep in contact with them through the early evening and durin the night.


We believe that this deal, in the future, will be very lucrative for Enron and MHEB.  Therefore, please use all diligence to make sure the deals are done correctly and maximize value for us both.

If there are any questions tonight, please, call/page Kayne Coulter or me.

Thanks,

Don"

,07/11/2001,,jclambert@pplweb.com,jstepeno@enron.com,,misc.,"Thanks for the invite to vegas in october, but I'm not going to be able to make
it. Frank Zingone is one of our hourly traders who is very active in both
real-time and day ahead northeast and would like him to take my place if thats
ok. Sound like I'm going to miss a good time, we'll have to hook up some other
time.

I noticed the PJM next day and bal week swaps haven't been on the menu lately,
someone on vacation? Too bad if not, I don't like dealing with the hassle of
the physical scheduling and reserve charges to PJM. I'm trying to get the
trading floor involved with more swaps and less physicals for those reasons.
just curious.

thanks again, let me know if Frank can schedule the trip.

On June 12, 2001, Boston Edison Company, Cambridge Electric Light Company, and Commonwealth Electric
Company (the NSTAR Companies) tendered for filing an amendment to their Open Access Transmission 
Tariff (Tariffs), which expand their offered services over the NSTAR Companies  entitlements to

,06/14/2001,,40enron@enron.com,,,Organizational changes,"We are pleased to announce the following organizational changes:

Enron Global Assets and Services

In order to increase senior management focus on our international businesses, we are creating a new business unit, Enron Global Assets and Services (EGAS).  EGAS will be led by Kevin Hannon, Chief Executive Officer, and Jim Hughes, Chief Operating Officer.  Kevin will report to the Enron Corp. Office of the Chairman.  With the exception of the Wessex Water Company (which will remain in the Enron Transportation Services organization) and Enron India (discussed below), EGAS will include all of the assets and activities of the former Enron Global Assets group and the Azurix organization.  EGAS will include Enron's assets and merchant activities in South America.  In order to ensure continuity in the management of our South American merchant business, John Lavorato will remain responsible for those merchant activities.  John will report to Kevin Hannon with respect to the South American merchant business, and will continue to report to the Enron Wholesale Services Office of the Chairman for all other activities in his role as Chief Executive Officer of Enron Americas.

Enron India

Enron's significant interests in India are commanding increased attention from Enron's senior management.  We are pleased to announce that Rebecca McDonald will focus exclusively on Enron's business in India, as Chief Executive Officer of Enron India, reporting to the Enron Corp. Office of the Chairman.

Enron Broadband Services

With Kevin's departure from Enron Broadband Services (EBS), we are also making a number of changes in the EBS organization.  Jim Fallon will now be President and Chief Operating Officer of EBS.  Paul Racicot, Marcello Romano and Fred Cohagan will maintain their EBS risk management activities within their respective regions.  Dave Cox will continue as Chief Commercial Officer of EBS and will also join Ken Rice and Jim Fallon in the EBS Office of the Chairman.  Finally, Rick Fehl will continue as Vice President of Network Engineering and Chief Network Officer but will now report to the EBS Office of the Chairman.


Enron Principal Investments

In order to better develop and manage equity investment opportunities related to Enron's core businesses, we are combining the existing investment groups in ENA, EBS, Enron Investment Partners and the Enron Special Asset Group into a single unit, Enron Principal Investments.  Enron Principal Investments will work with all Enron business units to identify, execute, and manage equity investments that leverage Enron's unique and proprietary knowledge.  These investments may be in the form of venture capital, leveraged buy-outs, traditional private equity and distressed debt positions.  This new business unit will be headed by Kevin Garland, Managing Director, and will report to an investment committee consisting of Dave Delainey, Ken Rice, and Greg Whalley. 

Enron Corporate Development

In order to improve coordination of Enron's corporate development activities, we are consolidating these activities under Andy Fastow, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.  Jeff Donahue, Managing Director of Corporate Development for EBS will now head Corporate Development across Enron.  Corporate Development leaders in the business units will have a dual reporting relationship to their business units and to Jeff.

One of Enron's most compelling challenges is the sale of certain assets or businesses that are no longer core operations.

As you may or may not know, there is currently an ""Adjust List"" that is issued when TLRs are called. An ""Adjust List"" is a recommendation from the IDC that describes what transactions should be cut and by how much to achieve needed relief to eliminate a constraint.  This Adjust List sent out to Generation and Load Control Areas and Tag Authors for all transactions that are being recommended for curtailment.  It is intended to aid in coordination Control Area schedules during curtailment, as well as alert the marketplace of recommendations for their transactions to be curtailed. Under the current process, the Adjust List notice is sent out when the initiating Security Coordinator and all impacted Security Coordinators have agreed to recommend specific curtailments.  As such, this recommendation can occur very late, leaving very little time for the market to react (i.e., resource and/or resink their power).  

The Potential Adjust List feature adds a second, earlier Adjust List that is sent out when the initiating SC requests relief, but prior to the confirmation of all the impacting SCs.  This should allow this recommendation to be delivered several minutes sooner than it is today, giving more time for the market to begin searching for alternate economic sources and sinks.  When all impacted SCs confirm, the standard Adjust List recommendation is sent out as it is today.

It should be recognized that both the Potential Adjust List and the standard Adjust List do not represent actual curtailments - in both cases, they are only recommendations for curtailment.  Control Areas may elect to curtail different transactions or amounts than reflected in either Adjust List due to local relief procedures or other business practices.  However, both lists should aid in mitigating risk associated with physical transactions and curtailments.  Further, empirical evidence seems to indicate that in the majority of cases, the Potential Adjust List, standard Adjust List, and final curtailments will be very close.

This change is based a proposal I wrote with the help and support of Jim Eckelkamp (Carolina Power and Light), Mark Scheel (Dynegy), and Patt Terris (Exelon Power Team).   If you talk to any of them during the course of daily business, please thank them for their support of this effort.  With their assistance in developing the concept, ironing out the technical details, and cultivating NERC support in the various forums,  we were able to implement this change very quickly. 

I expect this change to take place sometime between June 15 and June 28.  Attached, please find a message from NERC that describes the feature and how it works.  If you would like more detail, please let me know.  I currently Chair the group that is responsible for improving E-Tag, and as such, am intimately familiar with tagging and its functions.

In the next few weeks, I will be working with Don Baughman and Juan Hernandez to ensure we utilize this feature (and others) to maximize the value of our E-Tagging tools.  As indicated above, please feel free to contact me with any questions.

1.  On my Portcalc screen, everything was very tiny.  It worked but I know I 
couldn't copy a post id because I wouldn't be able to see the new number.

2.  I wanted to look at my curves last night and they opened up with errors.  
Basically it's like opening up the curves on a machine without the correct 
drivers.  Seems like we need to put those drivers on the network and maybe 
upgrade it to Oracle 8i too.

3.  I don't know how we can change the printer to print at home.  Only 
concern here is if we are offsite and have a local printer (will we be able 
to put that printer on the network?).  

That's all I can think of right now.

Any suggestions?

make.

I am going to set up a new counterparty in our system:  Enovate LLC.  Under 
this new counterparty will be 3 books in Tagg:  FT-ENOVATE, INTRA-ENOVATE, 
AND FT-INT-ENOVATE.  The INTRA-ENOVATE book will hold deals such as the 
Trunkline deal and will retain Rho & Drift.  The FT-ENOVATE book will be a 
flat book only used for  the confirmation process (deals must be in an FT 
book to be confirmed).  The FT-INT-ENOVATE book will pass Rho & Drift to the 
interest rate group.  This book will be used for EMW related deals not 
specific to Enovate.

The current entity Enron MW LLC will continue to be used and will have the 
following books in Tagg:  FT & Intra NSS1, FT & Intra NSS2, and FT & Intra 
TP.  FT and Intra MEH books will no longer be used.

The P&L will sum the 3 Enovate books to arrive at one number.  The other 
columns on the P&L(NSS1, NSS2, and TP) will be unaffected.

I had planned on just adding the Enovate books, but think we really need to 
set up a new entity as well.  I have run this by accounting and have their 
approval.  Let me know what you think and we will start the process.  We will 
have this completed by the end of this month.

Thanks.

I think I need some help reconciling what Steve Richman has and we have 
booked for the HUB deals.  He sent me a spreadsheet with deals but I cannot 
even come close to tying them out to what we have booked in Tagg.  Richard 
suggested I contact you since Steve is out.  Attached is a list of deals we 
currently have booked in Tagg for the HUB deals.  They need to be verified 
before I can calc them for value and positions.  I will be out tomorrow, 
returning on Monday.  Thanks for your help.  Please call me with any

I need some Tagg books set up for the Chicago office.  I submitted a request 
this morning to create a new counterparty:  Enovate, LLC which will be an 
Enron entity.  Under Enovate LLC I need two books:  FT-ENOVATE and 
INTRA-ENOVATE (P,B,I & GD).  I also need a book which will fall under the 
current Enron MW, LLC counterparty:  FT-INT-ENOVATE (P,B,I & GD).  And as 
usual I need these as soon as possible.  I will be out of the office on 
Friday but will return on Monday.  I really need to get deals moved to these 
books by the end of next week.  Please let me know if there is anything I 
need to do to help.  Thanks as always.

There is still some cash in the custodial accounts.  I wanted you to buy more 
of the existing mutual funds.  Also, I am going to write a check out of my 
CMA account for more than the current cash balance.  Do I need to sell some 
mutual fund shares? Or is it automatic?  Let me know.  Nice game in Palo 
Alto.  Once again the Horns can't live up to the hype.

Attached is the completed book request form.  I just want to clarify a few 
things.  The first three books are for Tagg.  The last two are for Sitara.  I 
will need a region set up in CPR to hold the physical deals.  Do you do 
this?  Or can you point me in the right direction.  I really need this 
completed by the end of the week.  Let me know if there is something else I 
need to do.  Thanks for your help.

Congratulations.  Welcome back.  I sent you a note and a spreadsheet with the 
deals we have booked in our system.  I was trying to reconcile them to your 
list of deals.  I could not.  But I think the best thing to do is to simply 
start over and book the deals you tell me to.  I just need the exact terms.  
I know it's your first day back and you are probably swamped, but when you

The reason my mistake was not caught on the benchmark signoff procedure is 
that the postid in question did not have a net position.  The procedure 
Rahmann showed you is where we check GERMS positions to the position reports 
we run using Excel queries.  If a postid has a net position and is not 
officialized, it will be caught using this procedure.  It will not, however, 
if the postid does not have a position.  I understand the importance of 
officializing postid's, as does the entire West desk.  Thanks.

,11/15/2000,,darron.giron@enron.com,eric.moon@enron.com,,Status,"Eric,
I am afraid I have not made that much progress on my assignment.  I talked to 
ML Ruffer about the $1.2M basis swap.  She does not specifically know about 
the deal, but does know she gave between $1M and $2M to the West desk out of 
a reserve behind the scenes.  I don't know for sure, but this has to be how 
the $ got in the West P&L.  It is booked on 11/12/99 which is between 
EC3952.P (the annuity getting the unamortized $27M into the West desk) and 
EC3952.S (the annuity getting the $5M from Corp into the West desk).  I 
hadn't paid attention until just now, but Suzette Emmons booked the deal.  
She ran the transport book at that time.  

The physical buys from Canada (EC2208.11, EC3952.15, and EC3952.11) are 
booked correctly in Sitara.  EC3952.11 was changed by Kathy Reeves from 
ending in '08 to ending in '01 on 4/4/00.  However, the end date remains '08 
in Sitara.  I don't know why the term was changed.

I have meetings almost all day.  I will still try and investigate, but I know 
you were looking for some answers today.  You may want to try and get in 
touch with Suzette and see if she remembers the basis swaps.

It just dawned on my that I never really thanked you for our visit.  All four 
of us had a great time.  It was so good to see all of you and especially 
great to see the kids get together and have so much fun.  I really regret 
that as I was growing up, we really did not see that much of each other( and 
by we, I mean the Kansas group and the Girons).  But even given that, I feel 
as if you all have been part of my life and every time we get together it's 
like we have always spent alot of time together.  I guess that's why they 
call it family.  So once again, thanks for your hospitality and we look

wrong.  Second, sorry this is late.  Friday was 1st day, our longest of the 
month.

   DRAFT

This is a summary of where we stand from a Risk Management perspective on the 
PGT/Socal permanent assignment to Calpine  Currently there are 5 deals in 
Tagg and 1 in the transport  model.

 EC3952.O - Annuity where the West desk pays PGT (from $.08987 to $.17308) on 
67,500/Day thru Oct-23
 This deal will be unwound and this income (approx $30M) will fall out in the 
West desk

 EC3952.F - Buy from Canada of 30,000/Day thru Oct-08 at Malin for Index + 
$.00
 EC3952.K - Sell to AEC of 30,000/Day thru Oct-08 at Malin for Index + $.00
 As of now, these deals will remain unchanged in the system because AEC will 
not let us out of the firm contract

 EC2208.B - Buy from Canada of 22,500/Day thru Oct-08 at Malin for Index - 
$.005
 EC3952.B - Buy from Canada of 15,000/Day thru Oct-01 at Malin for Index - 
$.01
 These deals will be unwound, but discussions between Philip Allen and ??? 
will reveal details not known at this point in time   (Bid/Offer)

 Transport Model - Kingsgate to Malin capacity of 67,500/Day beginning Nov-08 
thru Oct-23
 This deal will have to be unwound or killed - Currently the deal is valued 
at approx $12M in the West Desk

After unwinding these deals, the West desk will be kept whole, the remainder 
will be granted out in orig.

This is my first go at it.  Let me know of any revisions you want.

I got confirmation from the Head Coach at JV that AR is not going to UT. He 
scored a 760 on his SAT and apparently overslept a retake exam.  So I don't 
know if they actually pulled the offer, but it sure sounds like it.  Either 
way, the coach told my wife he will not be a Horn.  The coach is really

I looked over the info you forwarded but have decided to just buy two mutual 
funds.  Unless you have a better suggestion, buy APGCX and MCGTX.  And I 
really mean it when I say if you have a better suggestion let me know.  It 
looks like the transfers worked properly.  But are the automatic purchases of 
mutual funds in place?  I don't see the activity on the web page.  Lastly, 
and I think this is just administrative stuff, Kristi's Roth IRA does not 
show up on the web or on the statements we receive in the mail.  Thanks.

I think Risk can do two things to improve the process:  have more of us 
involved in the process so they actually see the implications of booking 
deals incorrectly and actively following up on recurring problems.  This last 
one I am particularly bad about.  I will see a variance that is rather small 
and just take it without looking into the underlying cause more carefully.  I 
think the OA group in general should take a more active approach in 
preventing problems rather than just identifying them.  But I know that is 
easier said than done.

********************************************************

Dear UT Alumni and Friends,

There are two funding issues before the Texas Legislature that are of
critical importance to The University of Texas
at Austin and all of higher education.  These issues are:

Increasing university tuition rates by $2 a semester credit hour each year
through the 2005-2006 academic year; and
Retaining 100% of indirect cost funding earned on research awards and
contracts.

WE NEED YOU TO CONTACT LEGISLATORS TO VOICE YOUR SUPPORT FOR THESE
MEASURES.  Unless these two issues are passed
by the Legislature, UT Austin risks being less competitive with its peer
institutions for faculty and research dollars,
and will lose the momentum that resulted from the investment made in higher
education for the last two legislative sessions.

INCREASING TUITION: Senate Bill 1466 by Senator Teel Bivins and House Bill
2531 by Representative Rob Junell would authorize
a $2 a semester credit hour increase in tuition rates each year through the
2005-2006 academic year.  The House bill also
increases tuition by $1 a semester credit hour for each of the following
five years.  We do not know which bill will
move first.  However, one of these bills should be before the full Senate
or House soon.  Please call your State Senator
and Representative and other members you know and say, ""I support SB 1466
and HB 2531, the bills to increase tuition
rates at universities, and urge you to vote for this legislation when it
reaches the Senate/House floor."" (Phone numbers available
at http://www.senate.state.tx.us/75r/Senate/senmem.htm and
http://www.house.state.tx.us/house/member.htm)
(or copy this address into the location/address field of your
browser)  Reasons to support the bill include:

Texas ranks 32nd among the states in total tuition and fees paid to
comprehensive colleges and universities.

Tuition is a necessary part of the financing for university operations
since general revenue provides only a portion of state
appropriated funds.  The first year revenue gain from the tuition increase
for all universities would be about $22 million.
Of that amount, over $6 million would flow to UT System universities.

Fifteen percent of the tuition increase is devoted automatically to student
financial aid.

RETENTION OF 100% OF INDIRECT COST FUNDING: Senate Bill 1, the State budget
bill, uses 50% of the indirect cost funds earned
by a university on research awards and contracts to offset university
appropriations.  The Conference Committee on SB 1 may consider
allowing universities to retain up to 100% of these funds.  Please call
members of the Conference Committee on SB 1 and say,
""I support allowing universities to retain 100% of indirect cost funds
earned on research grants and contracts, and urge you to
make that change in the Appropriations Bill, SB 1.""  The 10 Senators and
Representatives on the Conference Committee are:
Senators Rodney Ellis (512-463-0113), Robert Duncan (512-463-0128), Chris
Harris (512-463-0110), Steve Ogden (512-463-0105) and Judith
Zaffirini (512-463-0121), and Representatives Rob Junell (512-463-0472),
Garnet Coleman (512-463-0524), Pete Gallego (512-463-0566),
Talmadge Heflin (512-463-0568), and Buddy West (512-463-0546).
Reasons to support this change are:

All of the ten most populous states allow their institutions to retain 100%
of their indirect costs, except for Florida, whose
institutions retain 98%, and Texas, whose universities get only 50%.

UT Austin would gain an estimated $16.3 million per year in additional
revenue with this change.  This revenue could be
used to expand UT's research capabilities by supporting faculty, providing
seed money for new projects and purchasing
research-related equipment.

Three recent reports recommend that Texas universities be allowed to retain
100% of indirect cost funding.  These
include reports from the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board, a
special commission appointed by then-Lieutenant
Governor Rick Perry, and Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts Carole Rylander.

PLEASE TAKE THE TIME TO SUPPORT YOUR UNIVERSITY BY CONTACTING LEGISLATORS
ON THESE TWO IMPORTANT ISSUES.

Deal QO9203.1 erroneously liquidated in the month of January at a value of 
$306,900 when the deal has a March term date and valued correctly in the 
liquidations for that month (creating a duplicate liquidation for the same 
deal).; Please review the detail and let me know if you agree that the 
expense was taken in error by the management west book in Jan, or if I have 
picked up the incorrect post id, or if there is some other issue that I have 
missed.

The only other remaining variances for the management west book relate to 
Mirant Americas Energy Marketing.; I have been working with the financial 
settlements group to determine the variances between the liquidated value and 
the amount settled;;the ""MGMTWST_MIRANT"" file summarizes the differences.; 
Essentially, the liquidated value for 3 deals did not pick up the fixed price 
deduct values shown in TAGG, and one deal with a term date of November 2000 
through March 2001 did not ever liquidate.; The file has a summary page and 
then supporting worksheets for each deal listed.; 
;
The net effect, if you agree that the adjustments need to be made to the DPR, 
would be expense of $33,500 for the Mirant Americas Energy items and revenue

As we discussed today, the following is the TRV (Trader Report Viewer) 
project status:

?  TRV is targeted to be implemented by May 15th as scheduled.
?  TRV development and security setup has been completed and is ready to be 
presented to the traders. 
?  Hal and I will meet with Phillip and Kam tomorrow to provide the TRV 
system and administrator rights review, and to publish  their region's 
reports.
?  We will then meet with Darron, David, and Errol (to be scheduled for early 
next week) to provide the TRV system and  administrator rights review, and to 
publish their region's reports.
?   At the conclusion of the review, we will determine we will roll out the 
training for the remaining team members within each  region (i.e. Region 
Leads or IT to provide training to the team members).
?  Currently TRV is running in the development environment for the review 
period.  Upon conclusion of the review period, we will  ask for approval and 
UAT signoff from you in order to transition the system into the Production 
environment.

Again, thank you and each of your team members for everyone's help and

TRV system training for Region Leads began last week.  Currently, Kam,

that may be required or suggestions you may have. 

Please publish your region's report daily.  This will ensure report history

		 Subject: NEPCO / GSS Meeting,  December 14th

Greg,

 I really appreciated the time you spent with Derryl and I last week.  It was 
an excellent start to developing the significant opportunities that will 
benefit both GSS and NEPCO.  I look forward to continuing to work with you to 
deliver value to the NEPCO bottom line.

 I have attached meeting minutes from last Thursday's meeting, including 
action items for some of the areas we discussed.  One of the action items is 
to set a follow up in January for a GSS analytical team to gather data in 
your offices, and to begin developing specific supply strategies.  I met with 
the other SPLs this morning and identified the team members we would plan to 
send.  At the moment we would like to target January 30th and 31st for our 
follow-up.  I will work with the team to develop a specific agenda for that 
visit and will forward it to you by January 8th.

 Please let me know if you have any additions, deletions or changes to the 
attached minutes. 

        Happy Holidays,

HOUSTON, Dec 11 (Reuters) - Wholesale natural gas and electricity marketer 
Dynegy Inc. said on Monday its Dynegydirect Internet trading system had 
chalked up $1.5 billion in notional transaction values since its launch on 
Nov. 1. 
Dynegydirect (www.dynegydirect.com) currently carries Dynegy's bid and offer 
prices for over 300 energy and energy-related products, including North 
American electricity, natural gas and natural gas liquids. 
Coal, emission allowances and weather derivatives will be offered in the 
first quarter of 2001, with international energy products and 
telecommunications bandwidth following in the second quarter, Houston-based 
Dynegy said in a statement. 
Dynegydirect currently has over 400 registered users and Dynegy said that 
over $1 billion of the deals done to date over the system were generated by 
new customers for the company. 
In addition to its own portal, Dynegy has been trading on the Tradespark 
(www.trade-spark.com) multilateral online energy trading platform launched in 
September. 
Tradespark is backed by a partnership of several energy companies, including 
Williams Cos., TXU Corp. and privately owned Koch Industries. Dynegy has said 
it will join the partnership at a later date. 
Dynegy's home-town rival Enron Corp. is regarded as the frontrunner in online 
trading of wholesale energy products, with deals worth $183 billion 
transacted over its EnronOnline (www.enrononline.com) system between November 
1999 and October 2000. 
Enron executives have said they also plan to use other online trading 
platforms to do business and will not focus exclusively on the company's own 
platform."

,05/04/2001,,keith.dodson@enron.com,greg.whalley@enron.com,brian.stanley@enron.com,Good DASH,"Greg,

We were informed as of the Board meeting this week either you or Mark must 
sign all DASH's above $5 million. Early next week will be bringing you a DASH 
approved by RAC recommending selling our interest in the PEMEX EPC 63/64 
projects in the Gulf of Mexico to Horizon Offshore .  We believe this an 
extremely good deal for Enron.  In essence, it returns our equity and working 
capital funding for this project plus halts our risk and improves our project 
margin by $1.5 to $2 million. By the terms agreed, we will receive $25.6 
million in cash and a complete release and indemnity from liability. We have 
a performance bond which at minimum will be protected back-to-back by an 
identical bond from the same bonding source, but it is likely Horizon can 
assume our bond.

This is such a good deal you might wonder why Horizon would do it.   Since 
January we have been playing hardball with both Horizon and Pemex.  Horizon 
is public and their stock has been rising as a oil company service provider.  
This project is 35% of their volume.  We believe they cannot afford a wobble 
with Pemex due the potential impact on their share price. We see no upsides 
for us on these projects.

Prior to this collection EEOS year-to-date has  $102 million of net postive 
cash flow versus a 2001 plan of $83 million.  We now believe we will finish 
the year at $150 million positive.  A little bright spot from NEPCO and the 
EECC Collection Agency.

If you have questions,  I am here and Brian will be in Houston on Monday.

Support KidSave and Help Miracles Happen. Every Summer.
 
Kidsave,s  Summer Miracles Program enables orphanage children ages 5 to 11 to 
travel to the  US and Canada, live with families and attend day camp. The 
program gives  families who may be concerned about the problems of adopting 
an older child a  chance to meet, get to know and in the best-case scenario, 
fall in love with a  child. The program gives prospective parents an 
opportunity to see and evaluate  first-hand the challenges and rewards of 
adopting an older  child.
 
In 1999 and  2000 Kidsave and adoption agency partners placed 432 children - 
96 percent of  children who participated in the program. Generally, 85 to 90 
percent of  children who participate in the program find homes easily through 
the program.  The remaining 10 to 15 percent require more work.
 
Kidsave  believes every child deserves a family. We are committed to placing 
all children  who participate in the Summer Miracles Program in permanent 
families or  family-like environments.
 
We are looking  for families to host children, and for others who want to 
help us make the camp  program happen for these 250 children.   As a 
non-profit organization, Kidsave depends on donations to raise the  money to 
bring these children here and find them families.  Please call Tonya Hoppe at 
281.286.8948  or tonya@tonya.cc to get involved in Houston,s  Kidsave 
program.   


Enron and Kidventure Camps are proud to bring you Camp Enron Summer 2001.  
Celebrating our third year, Camp Enron  will once again be providing summer 
camp for children, ages 5-13, of Enron employees and contractors. 

This year, camp will be May 29-August 10.  Ten, one-week sessions will be  
available and families may choose to attend any or all sessions.  Each camp 
week is Monday through Friday. 

The cost is $150 per week and includes all transportation, field trips and 
activities.  A deposit of $50 per week is all that is needed to reserve your 
sessions.  

To register, log on to: http://www.kidventurecamp.com/camp_enron.htm.   
Spaces are limited.

Enron parents simply ride to work with  their children and check them in to 
the Energizer room in the morning with the Camp Enron Team.  Enron Campers 
are loaded on Coach USA Buses and transported to our nearby camp. At the end 
of the day campers are brought back to the Energizer for parents to check 
out.  

It's that easy!

attached changes to the Analyst / Associate PRC process, prior to execution.  
In summary, the following modifications have been developed by the heads of 
the AAPRC Committees (Horton, Kean, and Sherriff) and A/A Program Management 
(Lemmons):

? Most cross-calibration will be at the business unit level, since this is 
where the best interaction and information gathering occurs.  Steps to ensure 
consistency across the business units are outlined in the memo.  The final 
PRC meeting will focus on business unit ranking distributions, and the 
names/attributes of the top performers across the company.
? The PRC committees have been expanded to improve the quality of 
representation, and to reflect the diversity of our workforce.  The additions 
were selected from a pool of high performing VPs and Directors.  To ensure 
fairness, only VPs and Directors will provide representation on the AAPRC 
Committee.  
? An attachment has been included to clarify program tenure and promotion 
criteria.

Please let me know if you have any questions or would like to discuss by 
mid-day Wednesday, May 9.  We are planning to release this information to the 
memo distribution list that evening.

Bond Authorization Passes Senate On Party Lines; 90 Days Wait for Bond 
Money Begins

The Senate just passed bill SB 31X on a vote of 22-15 on party lines.
There was no crossover by Republicans.

*.  Sen. Burton indicated that we need to solve the problems and that the
problems were caused by the unfettered greed of the generators.  He stated
that if the MOU does move forward, he would insist that the generators take
a 30% haircut on monies owed because that is better than they would get in
bankruptcy court.

*. Republican Opposition:  Senators McClintock and Ackerman spoke against
the bill.  Arguments were basically about the use of revenue bonds and the
interest that taxpayers would have to pay.  They also made arguments about
the fact that the Governor's projections for conservation and rate increases
are not accurate.

*. Senator Peace gave his ""usual speech"" blaming the FERC for the situation
and indicated that Legislators have sued FERC over their inaction and said
that CA would win that battle and would get its money back.

2. Windfall Profit Tax Bill Goes Down to the Wire

There are indications that the Assembly Democrats intend to try to pass a
significant amount of legislation on Thursday in advance of an end to the
extraordinary session.  The priority remains SB 28X, a siting bill that has
been sent back to the Assembly.  (Sources report that there is disagreement
about the unemployment compensation terms laid out in this bill.)  According
to sources, the windfall profits tax bill, SB 1X, still remains in committee
in the Assembly.  It is unclear if this bill could be brought to a vote
tomorrow; we will continue to examine this issue."

The extraordinary session is about to 
close without 
passing the windfall profits bills.  Note that the legislative leadership is 
trying to

RJ


- There is some procedural dispute over who closes the extraordinary
session - the legislature or the governor.  Sources believe that the
governor actually closes the session and that he likely will do so after he
signs SB 31X at noon.

- Sources do not believe that the excess windfall profits tax
bills (SB 1X/AB 128X) are close enough to be passed by a vote before the
governor signs SB 31X.

- SB 28X, a power plant siting bill, has just passed the Assembly 74-0 and
is headed to the Senate.  The unemployment compensation provision, a source
of controversy, has been taken out.

- The Senate reportedly is only hearing regular session bills at this time.
As of 10:45 a.m. PDT, no extraordinary session bills were scheduled to be
heard on the Senate floor.  However, sources indicate that the Senate may
waive some rules to move bills to the floor faster.

- Once the extraordinary session is closed, a new extraordinary session is
expected to be opened immediately.  However, sources report that no one is
certain if the bills from this session will have the same numbers in the
next session.  The legislature reportedly is trying to arrange so that the
bills will not have to be heard again in committee."

Help Cure Cystic Fibrosis

The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation is hosting its annual Great Strides Walk on 
Saturday, May 19 at Hermann Park.  The event is the foundation,s major, 
grassroots fundraising event, and $0.92 of every dollar raised in the walk 
goes directly to furthering research into more effective treatments for the 
disease.

Cystic Fibrosis is the most common fatal genetic disease in the Caucasian

United States.  The current median survival age for CF patients is 31 years.

Support KidSave and Help Miracles Happen. Every Summer.
 
Kidsave,s  Summer Miracles Program enables orphaned children ages 5 to 11 to 
travel to the  US and Canada, live with families and attend day camp. The 
program gives  families who may be concerned about the problems of adopting 
an older child a  chance to meet, get to know and in the best-case scenario, 
fall in love with a  child. The program gives prospective parents an 
opportunity to see and evaluate  first-hand the challenges and rewards of 
adopting an older  child.
 
In 1999 and  2000 Kidsave and adoption agency partners placed 432 children - 
96 percent of  children who participated in the program. Generally, 85 to 90 
percent of  children who participate in the program find homes easily through 
the program.  The remaining 10 to 15 percent require more work.
 
Kidsave  believes every child deserves a family. We are committed to placing 
all children  who participate in the Summer Miracles Program in permanent 
families or  family-like environments.
 
We are looking  for families to host children, and for others who want to 
help us make the camp  program happen for these 250 children.   As a 
non-profit organization, Kidsave depends on donations to raise the  money to 
bring these children here and find them families.  Please call Tonya Hoppe at 
281.286.8948  or tonya@tonya.cc to get involved in Houston,s  Kidsave 
program.

NewPower is launching a revolutionary technology pilot to the first 500

PCs.  Sears Home Central will install and service the Remote Energy 
Management Solution at no charge throughout the duration of the pilot 
program.  For a typical household, the three-month pilot could result in up 
to 10 percent to 15 percent utility bill savings, based on personal usage and 
the size of your home.  


Be among the first to participate absolutely free.
Enrollment with the NewPower Connections Remote Energy Management Solution 
pilot program starts May 14 and continues through the end of the month.  For 
more information about this offer, visit NewPower's table located in the

,12/12/2000,,enron.announcements@enron.com,all.states@enron.com,,Improved Process for Engaging Temporary Workers,"As you are aware, Enron utilizes temporary staffing services to satisfy 
staffing requirements throughout the company.  For the past several months, a 
project team, representing Enron,s temporary staffing users, have researched 
and evaluated alternative Managed Services programs to determine which source 
would best meet our current and future needs in terms of quality, performance 
and cost containment objectives.  The Business Unit Implementation Project 
Team members are: 

Laurie Koenig, Operations Management, EES
Carolyn Vigne, Administration, EE&CC
Linda Martin, Accounting & Accounts Payable, Corporate
Beverly Stephens, Administration, ENA
Norma Hasenjager, Human Resources, ET&S
Peggy McCurley, Administration, Networks
Jane Ellen Weaver, Enron Broadband Services
Paulette Obrecht, Legal, Corporate
George Weber, GSS

In addition, Eric Merten (EBS), Kathy Cook (EE&CC), Carolyn Gilley (ENA), 
Larry Dallman (Corp/AP), and Diane Eckels (GSS) were active members of the 
Selection Project Team.

As a result of the team,s efforts, we are pleased to announce the beginning 
of a strategic alliance with CORESTAFF,s Managed Services Group.  This group 
will function as a vendor-neutral management entity overseeing all staffing 
vendors in the program scope. They will also provide a web based online 
technology tool that will enhance the ordering and reporting capabilities.  
The goal of our alliance with CORESTAFF is to make obtaining a temporary 
worker with the right skills and experience easier while protecting the best 
interests of the organization. 

We plan to implement Phase I of this improvement effective January 2, 2001.  
This Phase I of the implementation will encompass administrative/clerical 
temporary workers at the Houston locations only. If you currently have 
administrative/clerical temporary workers in your department, the enhancement 
will not affect their position. In an effort to preserve relationships, all 
current staffing vendors will be invited to participate in this enhanced 
program.  CORESTAFF shares our commitment to minimize any disruptions in 
service during this transition. 
 
We expect to incorporate the administrative/clerical workers in Omaha, 
Seattle and Portland in Phase II, which is scheduled for February, 2001.  The 
scope and timing of any additional phases will be determined after these two 
phases have been completed.

Realizing the impact that the temporary workforce has in business today, we 
selected CORESTAFF,s Managed Services Group based on their exceptional 
management team, commitment to quality service, and creative solutions to our 
staffing needs.  The relationship promises to offer Enron a cost effective 
and simple means for obtaining temporary employees.

In the coming weeks, Enron and CORESTAFF,s Managed Services Group will be 
communicating to Enron,s administrative/clerical temporary staffing vendors 
about the new process.  

There are many benefits to this new Managed Services program, which are 
outlined on the attached page.  More details on how to utilize CORESTAFF,s 
Managed Services program will be announced soon and meetings will be 
scheduled to demonstrate the reporting system and to meet the Managed 
Services team.

What is Managed Services?

CORESTAFF,s Managed Services program includes:

? Vendor-neutral management model
? Equal distribution of staffing orders to all staffing partners
? Web-based application with online ordering, data capture and customized 
reporting
? Benchmarking and performance measurement for continuous improvement
? Methodologies for accurate skill-matching and fulfillment efficiencies 

Key Benefits

? More vendors working on each order from the outset ) faster access to 
available talent pools
? Standardized mark-ups and fees to manage costs more effectively
? Online access to requisition status for users 
? Robust databases offering managers enhanced tracking and reporting of 
temporary usage and expenditures
? Standard and customized reporting capabilities -- online
? Tenured, experienced Managed Services team on-site to assist users in 
accessing web site, identifying usage trends, preparing specialized reports, 
etc.

 VOLUME 5, ISSUE 1 


MAY 2001 











NEW THIS WEEK 



Dear Greg, 

Did you know? According to a recent poll posted at thinkmobile.com, mobile 
professionals reported that they use their PDAs and handhelds to stay 
productive and keep in touch more often than they use laptops, pagers, or 
""smart phone"" devices. The reason for this growing trend in mobile computing 
is clear: today's handhelds are more than just organizers - with an array of 
feature-rich models and an increasing number of available applications and 
peripherals, handhelds are more like pocket-sized computers.

Road Warrior Tip #37 




Getting connected to the Internet from your hotel room can be impossible if 
your modem does not recognize the dial tone, which can happen in businesses 
with PBX phone environments. To avoid this, you can instruct your modem to 
dial without waiting for a recognizable dial tone. In Windowsc, go to the 
Settings menu. Click on Control Panel, then Phone and Modem Options. Choose 
Modem, and highlight your modem and select Properties.  Finally, uncheck the 
box that says, ""Wait for dial tone before dialing"".

green rule


  

There are several options to increase handheld performance:  
? Connectivity - You can now send and receive faxes and e-mail, or access the 
Internet wirelessly - all from your handheld! Upgraded models, such as the 
new Palm m505and Handspring Visor series,allow for wireless connectivity via 
clip-on modems. iGo offers Handspring modem modulesand the Omnisky Minstrel 
wireless modemfor Handsprings. Next, all you need is a service provider, such 
as OmniSky, and you're ready for the instant access you'd expect from a 
computer, all from the palm of your hand!  

? Storage - Current handheld space varies from 1MB of RAM up to about 24MB. 
With only 2MB of memory, a handheld can store up to 6,000 addresses, five 
years of appointments and 200 e-mails.  If you want to add applications or 
data, you can increase storage with memory modules for Handspring Visors, or 
with CompactFlash cards for the new Handera 330. In addition, expansion slots 
for memory are now available on Palm handhelds, with the arrival of the m500 
series models.  

? Keyboards - The size of handhelds makes using them convenient, but it can 
take you twice as long to enter data and work on files with their tiny 
keyboards and small styli. The smart timesaving solution is a PDA keyboard, 
which are available for Palm Connected Organizers, Compaq iPAQs, HP Jornada 
540and Handspring Visors. These ingenious devices fold up small enough to fit 
in your pocket, and then expand to the size of a normal, desktop keyboard. 

? Fun and Games - Use your handheld as a voice recorder, digital camera and 
GPS receiver? You bet! Several modules, such as the HandyGPS modulefor 
Handspring Visors, allow you to expand the functionality of your handheld, 
generally for less than $50. And, when you're done with work, it's time for a 
little play. Pass the time with a variety of games you can download to your 
handheld, from such software as 100 Great Games for Palm OS.

These are just a few suggestions for turning your ordinary organizer into a 
convenient computer. As the technology evolves, new peripherals are available 
all the time - turn to iGo for the latest and greatest accessories for every 
handheld make and model!

headquarters will be in Enron's offices to discuss their company and explore 
possible opportunities with Enron.  Woodside is the largest E&P company in 
Australia.   Enron was approached a couple of weeks ago by Woodside's Houston 
representatives regarding acquisition of oil and gas assets currently managed 
by ECR.  They also requested a meeting at a senior level to discuss other 
opportunities as well since their Australian execs were visiting Houston this 
week.  The agenda below was developed with input from Woodside's Houston 
representatives.  Woodside is interested in spending $1B on domestic US 
acquisitions.  They are also a large player in the LNG and natural gas 
markets in Australia. It appears that there are several areas where Enron and 
Woodside could interact.  Enron has attempted to do some LNG business with 
Woodside recently.  They do not seem to be fully aware of Enron's domestic or 
its global presence.  A goal of this meeting is to address this 
unfamiliarity.  I have attached briefing materials on Woodside for your 
review.  Hard copies of these materials are available upon request.  Special 
thanks to David Mims for his input.  If there are any other Enron personnel 
that should meet with Woodside on Thursday, please let me know.  Also please 
circulate this email to anyone that should be advised of this meeting or 
could benefit from the materials.

Add at the end of item 2: Investment terms and pricing;  Financing terms and 
pricing:

As indicated in the DASH, the $44.6MM represents the total amount requested 
for expenditures on project soft costs, as defined by accounting.  None of 
these dollars may be expended for hard costs, as defined by accounting, 
thereby preserving the ability to finance the power plant off balance sheet.  
Any additional project expenditures (including commitments) which may be 
requested through another DASH (for turbine payments as mentioned in this 
DASH or any new amounts) must be incurred by a financing vehicle/structure 
which will allow this power project to be financed off Enron's balance sheet.

,05/16/2001,,enron.announcements@enron.com,enron.wholesale.services@enron.com,,EGM Organization Update & Announcement,"The  first  quarter of 2001 was a record quarter for the performance of the
businesses  under the Enron Global Markets group.  We posted a gross margin
number  of  $100  million  for  the  first  quarter.  This represents a 38%
increase in gross margin after a very successful Q1 of 2000.  When combined
with  outstanding  results  posted in December of 2000, EGM has contributed
over  $187  million  to the Wholesale group in the last 4 months.  This was
due to tremendous contributions from each business group.

In  order  to  keep  the  momentum going and to facilitate more growth, the
following changes and additions have been made within the organization.

Crude and Products group
Mid-marketing
Bill  Berkeland  has  joined  the  group  and is responsible for creating a
focused  mid-marketing  function  specifically  within  this  group.   Fred
Lagrasta  is  responsible  for  mid-marketing  for Enron Americas and still
maintains  some  responsibility for various contacts and deal flow as well.
The purpose of this group is to be very focused in the development of crude
and  product  specific  products and services.  This group reports to Randy
Maffett.

Origination
In  order  to  manage  the  increased  origination opportunities around the
world,  the  Origination group has been changed in order to insure that the
proper focus is placed on these opportunities and to manage its wide scope.
Doug  Friedman  will lead our NGL and Petchem origination efforts reporting
to  John  Nowlan.   Joining  Doug will be Rick Cantrell recently hired from
Union  Carbide.   The global crude and products origination group has added
Randy  O'Conner  from  Red  Meteor,  who  has extensive experience in these
markets.   Both Randy and Doug Leach's growing fuels origination group will
report to Randy Maffett.

Trading
Lee  Jackson  will  assume  the  role  of U.S. NGL's lead financial trader,
supported  by  Chad South.  The petchem and plastic trading businesses have
been  reorganized under Stuart Bland.  Alan Engberg will be responsible for
plastics trading in the Americas.

Shipping
Scott  Moncrieff  will assume responsibility of our global shipping network
related  to  crude  and products.  Scott will be charged with expanding all
aspects  of the shipping portfolio taking advantage of our growing presence
in these markets and the successes we have had marketing shipping on line.

Weather
The  weather  group  under Mark Tawney's direction is expanding its efforts
around the world.  Europe will have an expanded focus and the London office
will  focus  on  new opportunities in Europe.  Paul Murray has joined Enron
from  Castlebridge  Partners  and  will  be moving to London to develop and
expand  the  continental  opportunities.  Ross McIntyre, currently based in
London,  will report to Paul.  Bill Windle has joined the weather group and
has  responsibility  for  origination activities for North America.  Bill's
most  recent assignment has been in the EBS organization.  The Oslo weather
office  managed  by  Thor  Lien  will  have  responsibility for Scandinavia
weather  activities.   In  addition,  employees  are  being  added  in  the
Australia and Japan regions.  We are now making markets in 32 cities around
the world on EnronOnline.

Coal
Mark Schroeder has joined the coal group and is responsible for origination
activities  with  generators in the U.S.  Mark's most recent assignment was
as  the  head  of  all  regulatory  activities  for Enron Europe, Japan and
Australia.

Enron Japan
The  momentum  of  power  deregulation  process  has  slowed in Japan.  The
decision  has been made to scale back the wholesale power activities.   Joe
Hirl,  President  and  CEO  of  Enron  Japan,  will now report into the EGM
organization.   Joe  will  maintain his direct responsibility of the office
and  will be increasing his focus on the business lines within EGM.  All of
these  products  have  high growth potential in both the near and long-term
and  he  will coordinate and help implement with all the business lines and
their activities.

LNG
LNG  continues  to  expand  with  the  vision  to  increase  the  number of
transactions and create a portfolio of assets and contractual access around
the   world.    Jonathan  Whitehead  has  joined  the  LNG  group  and  has
responsibility for all trading and shipping activities.

Neal Gerstandt, previously an independent energy consultant,  Jared Kaiser,
from  Enron  Americas  - East Gas Desk, and Kurt Lindahl, from Enron Global
Assets, have also joined the LNG group with responsibilities in the area of
origination in the Western Region.

Enron Freight Markets
EFM  has  concluded over 2,000 transactions in its first two months.  Chris
Kravas  continues  to  focus  on  building  the spot trading and mid-market
capabilities  that  will enable it to be the dominant player in its market,
and has hired four new traders in the last two weeks.  Kellie Metcalf, from
EBS,   has  joined  Shawn  Cumberland's  origination  effort,  and  Deirdre
McCaffrey,  from  Gas  Structuring and Mid-Market, has joined Matt Arnold's
forward trading group focusing on diesel products.

Global Risk Markets
David Hoog joined Enron from Ace Insurance in December 2000 and has quickly
built  a  team of people specialized in trading unit contingent power price
call  options,  a  hybrid  insurance derivative product. Drawing on Ace and
Enron  resources,  this  team  is  based  in  New  York  and  includes Alex
Tartakovski  and  Larry Marcus from Ace, as well as Joana Bekerman and Tony
Chang  who recently moved to New York from Houston. Their first transaction
closed just 3 months after startup.

Brad  Blesie  will  be  moving  to  London  in  June to establish a base of
operation  for  GRM and expand our insurance derivative activities into the
European  market  place.  Among the opportunities he is currently exploring
are  contingent call options applied to shipping and charter rates, trading
insolvent  insurance  claims,  and combining North Sea oil and gas VPP risk
with decommissioning insurance.

In  April this year, EGM established a hedge fund origination effort in New
York  reporting  to  Per Sekse and led by Russell Dyk who recently moved to
New  York  from  LNG  in  Houston. Russell is responsible for expanding our
commodity  trading  relationship  with  hedge  funds  to include crude oil,
products,  liquids  and other commodities traded by EGM. Joining Russell in
this  effort is Stephen Plauche, who comes to us from Enron Americas' power
trading desk.

Financial Trading
Elsa   Piekielniak   has  assumed  responsibility  for  Enron's  developing
agriculture  business.   Billy  Lemmons has changed groups and now runs the
Analyst and Associate program for Enron Corp.

Please congratulate everyone on their new assignment and we look forward to
the continued growth in all the EGM businesses."

,05/16/2001,,businessweek_online@clickaction.net,gwhalle@enron.com,,BW Economic Briefing - June 27-29 - San Diego,"Given the current economic climate, BusinessWeek will gather leading economic 
editors and advisors to give a special briefing at our upcoming Breakthrough 
executive event, taking place June 27-29, 2001 at the Rancho Bernardo Inn, 
San Diego, California.

For more information about Breakthrough go to 
http://www.you-click.net/GoNow/a14110a34607a63653009a1.

Entitled ""The New Economy Downturn,"" this briefing will feature a keynote 
address from BusinessWeek Economics Editor and author of the best-seller, 
""The Coming Internet Depression,"" Michael Mandel. Mandel will also lead an 
exclusive, closed-door roundtable discussion among BusinessWeek's top editors:

-  BusinessWeek Washington Editor Lee Walczak will tell us why Washington 
hasn't panicked over the downturn and offer a prediction of future action by 
the Fed, the Hill, and the White House

-  Senior L.A. Correspondent Chris Palmeri will assess the impact on the 
California economy and its energy crisis in the context of the downturn.

-  BusinessWeek Online's ""Street Wise"" columnist Margaret Popper will share 
her insights on how the Street may respond in these uncertain times.

Together, these editors (and others to be confirmed) will offer Breakthrough 
delegates access to the best economic intelligence available and facilitate a 
candid dialogue on the most pressing issues on every chief executive's mind.

***** Qualified BusinessWeek subscribers are entitled to a preferred 
participation fee ($2500, standard fee is $3250) at Breakthrough, which will 
convene a small group of senior executives (vice presidents and above) to 
discuss breakthrough ideas in business leadership. To participate, please 
complete the registration application at 
http://www.you-click.net/GoNow/a14110a34607a63653009a0.
Please use the code BT-BWS to indicate your subscriber status.*****

The economic briefing is only one of the diverse topics being examined at the 
conference. BusinessWeek's goal in convening Breakthrough is to create a 
setting where there can be meaningful discussion on the fundamental changes 
that are occurring in the business environment. Through intense interaction 
among delegates, we hope to facilitate a meaningful discourse on the trends, 
theories and technologies that underlie today's key corporate issues.

Facilitated by an elite faculty of thought leaders, the discourse will be 
structured around these five issues:

-  The Changing Rules of Leadership and The Evolving Qualities of Leaders
-  Continuous Supply-Chain Funding and Precision Demand Forecasting
-  Globalization, Technology, and the ""Trusted Identity""
-  Pervasive Computing and the Proliferation of Wireless Technologies
-  Customer Ascendancy

The retreat's co-founder and provocateur, Jim Taylor, has been named one of 
America's leading business futurists by the Wall Street Journal. The former 
head of global marketing for Gateway, he has served as a consultant and 
strategist to firms at the forefront of the New Economy, and has written and 
spoken extensively on the sweeping changes technology has wrought on our 
corporate, political, and cultural systems. His books, The 500 Year Delta and 
The Visionary's Handbook, co-written with Watts Wacker, are widely regarded 
as indispensable reads for forward-thinking executives.

Joining Jim, the retreat's esteemed faculty will include:

-  Deepak Chopra, M.D., Founder, The Chopra Center for Well Being
-  Dr. Ronald Heifetz, Co-director, The Center for Public Leadership, John F. 
Kennedy School of Government, Harvard University
-  Sandy Kemper, Founder and CEO, eScout
-  Suzanne D. Lyons, Chief Marketing Officer, Charles Schwab & Co., Inc.
-  Michel Mayer, General Manager, Pervasive Computing Group, IBM Corporation
-  Jonathan Nelson, Co-founder, CEO, and Chairman, the Organic Institute
-  Will Rodgers, Principal, SHR Perceptual Management
-  Geoffrey S. L.  Shaw, President, CEO, Chairman and Co-founder, Global 
Commerce Systems
-  Guy S. Tallent, President and CEO of Identrus
-  J. Craig Venter, Ph.D.. President and Chief Scientific Officer, Celera 
Genomics Corporation
-  Stephen G. Vetter, President, Eureka Communities

In a unique teamwork exercise, four-time America's Cup Champion Dennis Conner 
and members of his ""Stars and Stripes"" crew will lead Breakthrough delegates 
on a sailing regatta in San Diego Harbor. Ten boats manned by Breakthrough 
executives will engage in an Olympic style sailboat race in the San Diego 
Harbor. The boats will serve as tools in this exercise designed to explore 
the new realities of leadership, competition, and teamwork in the new 
economy. The race is serious but the lesson (and the fun) will be invaluable.

Interested parties are encouraged to apply asap as capacity is limited to 100 
executives and few spaces remain. For complete details on Breakthrough's 
agenda and speakers, please visit

Michael asked me to get back to you regarding ICE's all-share Offer for IPE.

Summary of Offer

The key aspects of the Offer are as follows:

? It comprises a share-for-share exchange of 1 ICE Class A1 Share and 1 ICE 
Class B (Redeemable) Share for each IPE Share (note that ICE Shares are not 
listed on any exchange).

? The following values (given by Goldman Sachs and KPMG) have been ascribed 
to each such ICE Share:

 - each ICE Class A1 Share has an estimated value ranging from $1.75 to $6.11
 - assuming redemption, each ICE Class B Share has an estimated value ranging 
from $4.80 to $5.33
 - assuming no redemption, each ICE Class B Share has an estimated value in 
the same range as each A1 Share

? Class B Shares allow for certain rights of redemption by ICE for cash, 
namely $5.895 per share.  Redemption rights arise for a period of one month 
from the first anniversary of the date on which the IPE Brent Futures and the 
Gasoil Futures Contracts have traded exclusively for 10 consecutive trading 
days through the electronic trading platform.  Redemption rights also arise 
in other circumstances, e.g. if ICE is the subject of an insolvency event.  
After the first redemption event to occur, non-redeemed Class B Shares 
(redemption is at the option of the shareholder) automatically convert to 
Class A1 Shares.

? Although ICE Shares will not be listed, it is expected that there will be a 
limited dealing facility through which Class B shareholders will be able to 
trade.

? The electronic trading platform referred to above will be developed by ICE 
through a technical services agreement.

? Class A Shares are transferable to any transferee, subject to ICE board 
consent, not to be unreasonably withheld.  Other than in relation to the 
redemption rights described above, Class B Shares have identical rights to 
Class A Shares.

? Assuming all of the IPE Holdings shares are acquired by ICE, then the IPE 
Holdings' shareholders will hold 10% of the issued share capital of ICE.

? The Offer is subject to valid acceptances being received by 29 May in 
respect of at least 90% of the value of IPE Holdings shares (or any lower % 
determined by ICE, but being at least 50%).

Other Points to Note

? Enron's current shareholding in IPE Holdings is 136,720 shares (this is 
equivalent to 1.19% of the total share capital of IPE Holdings).

? Those members of ICE (or companies associated with members of ICE) having 
shareholdings in IPE Holdings account for 9.83% of the total share capital of 
IPE Holdings. You should therefore assume that acceptances will be received 
at least as to 9.83%.

? If ICE receives acceptances as to 90% or more of the IPE Holdings shares, 
then our shares in IPE Holdings can be mandatorily acquired.

? If we are to make a competing offer, we will needed to have appointed a 
financial advisor, carried out necessary due diligence and preferably 
discussed details with IPE's management. Bearing in mind the closing date of 
29 May, we would have to move quickly if we are to make an offer. (This is 
assuming that acceptances in excess of 50% have not been received by that 
time - however, institutional investors tend to deliver acceptances only at 
the last minute).  We could make an announcement prior to the closing date of 
29 May that we were considering making an offer, although the prior approval 
of the Takeover Panel would be needed  - and a short timetable would be set 
by the Panel for announcing full details of the offer, if we were to 
proceed.  

? Given the particular components of ICE's offer (e.g. retained equity in 
ICE; the complementary nature of the ICE and IPE businesses; and the critical 
participation of ICE in developing IPE's electronic trading platform), we 
should consider carefully the terms of any competing offer we may decide to 
make. 

Please would you let me know what further steps you would like to take 
(including whether you would accept the ICE Offer), and if there is any 
further information you need. (I will send you separately by fax a copy of 
the Offer Document).

Thanks

Acta's New B2B Data Server Now Available for Multiple Operating Platforms; 
ActaWorks 4.4 Significantly Expands Support for Industry-Leading Data 
Integration Solutions

NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Dec. 12, 2000--Acta Technology, Inc., the leader 
in business-to-business (B2B) data integration, announced today the general 
availability of ActaWorks 4.4, the latest version of its award winning 
enterprise data server. ActaWorks 4.4 provides recent product and performance 
enhancements that previously were available only for Windows NT (under 
ActaWorks 4.3). Acta made the announcement at the eBusiness Conference and 
Expo in New York City. 
The new product significantly expands support for the industry-leading 
provider of B2B data integration. With ActaWorks 4.4, businesses with Windows 
NT, Windows 2000, and Unix environments (HP-UX, Sun Solaris, and IBM AIX) can 
all employ Acta's new enhancements for packaging and delivering the data 
essential for B2B eCommerce and business intelligence. 
Among the new features is a repository architecture that enables centralized 
metadata management and multi-user development. As businesses implement a 
data platform to support both internal and external access to enterprise 
data, the need to manage metadata from external and internal sources becomes 
critical -- and the need for multiple users increases. 
The addition of these new enhancements further solidifies Acta's leadership 
position in B2B data integration, a rapidly emerging component of B2B 
integration. Industry analysts have sized the data integration market at $15B 
(cumulative) by 2005 -- a market that is being driven by the growing need to 
provide information-rich data both inside and outside the extended 
enterprise."

Thanks for lunch a few weeks ago.  Sounds like you have a ton of work and 
responsibility these days.

Also, thanks for working with Gros on CommodityLogic.  It is a great 
application that I think will help our industry better manage the ever 
increasing transaction flow.

In addition to CommodityLogic, and as a follow-up to our lunch, I would like 
to come over in a few weeks and sit down and show you and your team what we 
mean by ""outsourcing"" your mid and back office functions to our 
""ProsessCo/ServiceCo.""  I think we have identified what types of services we 
could offer and under what type of arrangements.  Basically, you have risk 
reporting, general ledger, deal capture, confirmation, 
nominations/scheduling, volume management and settlements (invoice and cash 
payments/collections).  We will articulate how it works and how it hopefully 
makes sense for you to let us add a few more resources to accomodate your 
growing business instead of you building it from scratch.  

I also talked to Whalley and Bibi about your concerns on security/neutrality, 
comparable service levels to Enron, term and the ability to do financial 
easier than physical.  We can go through all that as well.

I will contact you soon and arrange a time.

Let me know your thoughts.

First, we need to determine what each piece is in the mid/back office that 
can be commercialized and how we would separate these different pieces.  In 
other words, how we separate risk reporting and general ledger and where we 
put it at Enron.  How we put the physical gas nominations and power 
scheduling at the desks.  How we take the rest for gas and power (and/or 
financial) and create ProcessCo/ServiceCo as a separate entity or within Net 
Works.

Second, once we know the different pieces, can we separate them from a 
systems perspective ( I am assuming that separating people is 
straightforward)?

Third, assuming we can separate things, how we communicate back to the other 
parts.  In other words, how we communicate information back to Enron's SAP 
system, how we settle for Enron if they want ProcessCo to do physical 
settlements, how we receive information so we can deal capture and confirm, 
etc.  All the linkages.

Fourth, how we create an agreement between ProcessCo and EWS that defines 
payments, service levels, term, etc. that can be a model for other companies 
as well.

Fifth, how this all deals with CommodityLogic and its business model.

Sixth, if we go alone or work with someone like Arcordia (after Beth's 
meeting).

Finally, how we originate these deals and charge for our service.

I know that alot of this is being done in different parts on different time 
schedules, but I would like to get it all pulled together soon in the 
following format:

A draft of a contract between EWS and ProcessCo (or Net Works).  Also, a 
clear picture of what systems and functions would be in this entity.  Also, a 
recommendation on how Enron maintains its risk reporting and general ledger 
as well as physical noms and scheduling and where that stays in Enron and how 
those functions work with ProcessCo.

Sheri Thomas, Jeff Harbert, Frank Davis, Fred Philipson, and Andrea Crump are 
now full time reporting to Tom on commercialization, all have mid/back office 
experience and can help Beth and Sally with alot of this work before Tom 
comes back from his cruise at the end of next week.

Mark Lewis, Forbes.com, 05.18.01, 1:30 PM ET 

NEW YORK - Any successful initial public offering is good news for Wall 
Street these days, but Instinet's debut was especially auspicious--not just 
for the moribund IPO market but for the electronic networks that are supposed 
to usher investors into the digital future. 

Instinet (nasdaq: INET - news - people) is Wall Street's oldest and largest 
electronic communications network (ECN), of the sort that matches buyers and 
sellers directly rather than forcing them to go through an intermediary. 
Instinet raised $464 million when it priced above its expected range at 
$14.50 per share. The stock opened this morning at $17 and was up 30%, to 
$18.19, in midday trading. 

That performance was a vindication for Instinet's corporate parent, Reuters 
Group (nasdaq: RTRSY - news - people), the London-based media and financial 
services giant, which retains 86% of the newly public ECN. Reuters had been 
criticized for taking Instinet public during a weak IPO market. 

[Full disclosure: The author of this piece is a former Reuters reporter, and 
Reuters' venture capital Greenhouse Fund is an investor in Forbes.com.] 

Since Reuters acquired Instinet in 1987, it and the other ECNs have evolved 
into a major threat to the established stock exchanges. Instinet's successful 
IPO could prompt similar moves by such rivals as Island and Archipelago. And 
it also bodes well for Nasdaq's plan to take itself public sometime next 
year. 

""The Instinet IPO further legitimizes electronic trading for the broad 
investment community,"" said TowerGroup analyst Robert Iati in a recent 
interview. TowerGroup is a research firm that studies the impact of 
technology on the financial services industry. 

When the Instinet IPO first was discussed several years ago, some observers 
expected it to establish a market valuation that would exceed the worth of 
Reuters itself. Those were the heady days of the Internet boom, when the new 
online brokerages, investment banks and ECNs seemed destined to triumph over 
Wall Street's old-fashioned ways. 

But the traditional broker-dealers, banks and stock exchanges have been 
adapting to the digital challenge, and, meanwhile, the stock market's swoon 
cut into online trading volumes. So nowadays, expectations for the ECNs are 
less exuberant. Instinet's IPO-established valuation of $3.5 billion is 
relatively modest, given that the parent company's current market cap is 
around $20 billion and that Instinet contributes about one-fifth of Reuters' 
revenues. 

Reuters has pulled back from plans to turn Instinet into a more 
retail-oriented operation. But the ECN's wholesale trading volumes remain 
robust. Instinet last year took in revenue of $1.2 billion and posted a 
divisional profit of $234 million. Reuters intends to maintain majority 
control of Instinet, which will be housed in the flashy new Reuters Building 
at Times Square. 

Now that it is public, Instinet can use its stock as currency to acquire 
other ECNs. Instinet already owns a stake in Archipelago, the Chicago-based 
ECN whose backers include Goldman Sachs (nyse: GS - news - people), Merrill 
Lynch (nyse: MER - news - people) and E*Trade Group (nyse: ET - news - people
). Another potential consolidation play is Island, a New York-based ECN 
backed by several private equity firms and by online brokerage Datek Online 
Holdings. 

Apart from acquisitions, Instinet also can use some of its IPO proceeds to 
continue upgrading its technology--a pressing need for all ECNs, which must 
remain competitive as the Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange become ever 
more adept at the electronic trading game. 

Finally, being a public company has a symbolic value for Instinet. This IPO 
sets a precedent by establishing an ECN as a high-profile player on Wall 
Street. That will boost the Instinet brand--and those of its rivals. This is 
the first ECN to go public, but it won't be the last."

I just spoke with Liz regarding my request for a brief meeting with you this 
week.  In light of Enron's overall thrust to focus on merchant oriented 
activities and to diminish exposure on assets in emerging market, my boss, 
Chris Hunt, suggested that I meet with you, among other individuals, to seek 
advice on alternative career options at Enron.  Although I am open to areas 
in which I would be most useful to the company, I do have a particular 
interest in getting involved in wholesale electricity markets.

I hope you will have the time to meet briefly.  For your convenience, 
attached below is my resume.

Best regards,

First of all, Louise, I understand we have a baby??  CONGRATULATIONS!! 
(details please, at your earliest chance)

Regarding the Wharton e-Business Initiative (see below for one of the many 
eMails I've received concerning Enron's participation--link to the referenced 
web site for specific agenda; also, I've received several voice messages from 
leaders of the effort).  The information below discusses one of the  forums 
(coming up 5/31-6/1) that comprise an on-going e-business initiative in which 
Enron has invested with Wharton.

 The participants from Wharton include senior level professors; while there 
may be some student involvement, the intentional focus is high level 
discussion and research endeavors at the professorial level.  
Other participants in WeBI are Corporate representatives.  The idea is for 
the professors to offer their latest research issues, promote discussions 
among the corporate participants to talk through the professors research and 
other research in the literature, as well as for the professors to listen for 
new areas for which commercial eBusinesses are seeking new research.

Again,  this is intentionally designed as a High Level Professor 
participation on the Wharton side, and high level e-Business Corporate 
executives on the other side. This is intentionally designed to create a 
high-level 'e-think-tank' environment for senior level professors and 
corporate executives.

O.K.....have I labored enough to describe what WeBI is all about??

As opposed to the several other efforts Enron University Affairs has to 
DIRECTLY increase Enron's favorability and familiarity on campus at levels 
above recruiting, but that ultimately trickle down to recruiting, this is 
intentionally a research/discussion effort. Clearly, the Enron Brand equity 
in dealing with professors is that the professors ultimately incorporate work 
from information from the participatory forums into their class teachings, 
references, course work, etc. 

A few weeks ago, Louise and I breifly chatted about Enron's involvement in 
this effort.  Clearly, there is a HUGE interest by the Wharton professors and 
other corporate participants involved to have Enron attend and 
participate---they quite respectfully call me and eMail me very 
frequently.......All of this is very interesting to me and I have shepherded 
our minimal involvement-in-fact........ yet the question remains:  is there 
someone at Enron, directly involved in Enron's eBusiness initiatives, 
interested in jumping into this effort and participating?  Do those of you 
involved in these businesses think it worth your time and expense, or the 
time and expense of one of your senior (at least Director level) people to 
participate?  Would it be viewed, at least at this time,  simply as an ""Enron 
brain drain"" (I've received this realistic and possibly quite legitimate 
concern from more than one business person at Enron).   

The bottom line is, I'd like to be able to respond intelligently and honestly 
to those at Wharton committed to this effort.  I feel more than comfortable 
telling Wharton that, at this time, Enron is satisfied to participate in the 
WeBI effort largely at the 
financial level it has already invested--with the option to participate at 
other levels in the future, at Enron's discretion.

ALL comments solicited----

Many thanks!!"

A source had a meeting today with California state treasurer Phil Angelides.  
Here are the main points from their conversation

1. Anglelides Certain that SoCal Will Go Bankrupt

Corroborating our line over the past four months, Anglelides stated with 
confidence that SoCal would go bankrupt and that ""he was surprised they 
hadn't already.""  He noted that the only reason they haven't yet is that 
""they were too stupid to ring-fence the parent"" and that ""their two biggest 
equity holders were screaming not to do it.""

He added that the Davis/SoCal MOU is dead and that all the ""Plan B's"" are 
""speculative"" at best.  He also thought that SoCal was being ""naive if they 
thought they would get a better deal from the legislature than from the 
bankruptcy court.""

2. Bond Issuance- $12B Not Enough

Angelides conceded that a $12B bond issue would not be enough to buy power 
for the summer and that the true costs would probably be $18-24B.   The only 
reason they didn't issue more is that Angelides felt that ""$12B was all the 
market could handle.""  The current game plan for bonds assumes an average 
peak price for power of $400/MWh, which Angelides said explains the 
difference between his estimates and the higher estimates from State 
Comptroller's Kathleen Connell's office.

3. New Generator Construction

Anglelides was explicit that the California Public Power Authority 
(authorized by the legislature last week) will ""build plants and not stop 
until we [California] has a 10-15% capacity cushion above expected demand.  
Angelides expects the state to be ""5-10% short on power all summer."""

,05/22/2001,,greg.piper@enron.com,greg.whalley@enron.com,,"EnronOnline, etc.","Did you talk to Dynegy about buying the engine behind EnronOnline?

I know Andy is going to work for Arnold in the next 4 to 6 weeks, but he is 
getting a team geared up around selling some EnronOnline licenses to various 
markets like Agriculture, crude/petchems, energy, etc.  We would not support 
software behind someone else's firewall, but these would be dedicated 
environments we set up and license and possibly support (what you and I 
talked about last week).  We have some traction with some companies like Dow 
and GM on an application license as well as renting them a row or rows on 
EnronOnline, but those sales have some cultural issues associated with them 
as well.  

I think you and I could actually originate some license deals on our own with 
Dynegy, Calpine, Duke and El Paso.  I briefly brought it up with Posoli (in 
addition to mid/back office outsourcing which we will pitch to him the first 
week in June) and he said he doesn't want to create CalpineOnline.com, but he 
said that just being able to wire together his gas and power traders on the 
back end would be great.  Clearly, Lavo needs to agree that he is comfortable 
with others in this space having these tools.  I think I know the commercial 
lead at El Paso, you and I know some people at Duke, you know Dynegy and and 
I know Posoli too well.  You probably have other contacts I am not aware of 
as well.

I think if we got serious traction on 4 or 5 licenses, then the application 
companies would be real strong bids for the business later if we want to let 
someone else build it from 5 to 100 licenses.  The whole issue is that we are 
stuck in the starting block at zero license sales and the 
application/software companies we have talked to love the application but are 
nervous, despite our reputation as the great company that gets technology and 
has the best site/system in the world, about taking huge risk on code that is 
proven in a single enterprise situation, Enron.

We will continue to see if Reuters, CommerceOne, Sungard, TibCo, i2, etc. are 
interested in owning all or part of the intellectual property, but they 
currently seem to be a low bid for raw source code with no proven customers 
other than Enron in an environment where they have been beat up and are 
reluctant to print stock or deplete cash.  However, some of them have yet to 
show their bid so we will let that process continue.

On mid and back office, I am met with Vickers and Tycholiz and am seeing 
Mrha, Luce and Duran this week.  They all get the basic premise.  Sally is on 
board and focused on operations/pricing.  I think the reorg we just had will 
work.  We should have a draft of an agreement with SLAs soon for physical 
gas, physical power and financial.  It would be used for you and others.  We 
should be hitting the market with the tier 2 and 3 customers in a few weeks.  
I gave Tom six new people who would focus on selling these services, working 
with EA folks and have experience in Sally's shop.

You and I could also talk to the shops above about at least having ProcessCo 
for all energy OTC deals as we discussed.

Your thoughts on selling licenses to companies so close to our core product 
line?

,05/23/2001,,michael.brown@enron.com,greg.whalley@enron.com,"john.sherriff@enron.com, mark.frevert@enron.com",,"As you know, John and I now have quarterly business reviews with each of our 
business and commercial support units and I thought it might be helpful to 
provide you with a brief overview of Q1 and the areas of focus going forward 
prior to your visit.

IBIT 

? Enron Europe delivered Q1 IBIT of $86.9m ($6.4m over target).  This is 
after covering Margaux losses of $12.2m not in plan. 
? Net Income at $54.1m was $25m over target after absorbing Margaux losses.  
This is due to:
- $10m interest savings from the Camelot transaction, which has now moved 
more of the metal inventory financing costs into gross margin.
- the adoption of FAS 133 which produced a net gain of $13m as a result of 
marking to market contracts which were previously accounted for on an 
accruals basis.
? On a like for like basis compared to 2000, our Gas and Power businesses  
(UK, Continental, ETOL and Enron Direct) have (circa) doubled IBIT from $70m 
to $134m and Net Income from $46m to $107m.
? Metals generated a net loss before taxes of $54.6m.  This comprised gross 
margin of $7.7m, expenses of $42.5m and interest of $19.8m (net of receipts). 
(This does not include interest on funds used for the MG acquisition).


EXPENSES

? Reduction in our expense base continues to be a significant focus, 
resulting in lower than plan expenses of $16m.  If you exclude metals which 
is $10m over plan and the $8.8m bonus accrual against $5m in the plan, you 
will note that we reduced our expenses by approximately $29m in the rest of 
our business.  The plan itself was materially lower than that presented to 
John and I by the business and support groups. We are therefore making 
significant progress in respect of reducing our expenses, we expect continued 
savings to be made particularly as we are able to start extracting savings 
from the metals business.


HEADCOUNT

? We are about 50 down on plan for headcount and I would expect this trend to 
continue. Again we will see significant headcount reductions when the metals 
systems are functioning (Metals headcount is 622 with an additional 70 full 
time staff working on Metals support).
? Headcount will be reduced by over 20 in the Middle East.
(NB. The headcount numbers include full time temp and contract staff, which 
make up about 10% of our headcount)


TRAVEL & ENTERTAINMENT

? Total costs are down 25% on budget with the total number of flights down by 
58% on budget. The major spender is Metals which accounts for 25% of all 
costs.


OVERSEAS OFFICES

?  We are in the middle of a full scale review of each of our offices and 
will close or downsize those that do not make sense from a P&L or franchise 
perspective.

IT

?  IT is 18% of our headcount and accounts for 25% of our salaries and wages, 
14% of our G&A spend and 10% of our consultancy spend.  We have already made 
significant progress in this area, our headcount has been flat over the last 
6 months and we have introduced a series of measures to increase the 
accountability and focus of the IT group and to ensure resource is allocated 
effectively.  Mark Pickering is presently working with Booz Allen to identify 
and address additional areas of savings.  Finally and most importantly in 
this area we are working with the commercial groups to ensure that they ""own"" 
the IT projects and development, which will minimise waste and increase focus.

MIDDLE/BACK OFFICE

? Middle and back office operations constitute 13% of our headcount and 11% 
of our salaries and wages. Fernley has kicked off a review which he believes 
will save us 20% on headcount and costs.

FINANCING COSTS

? Our financing costs in Q1 amounted to $58.7m and with the focus on funds 
flow targets this number will be higher in the future. This area is one which 
will receive massive focus going forward. 

The key areas are;
 - reduction in Metals financing costs
 - effective use of the desks to create funds flow rather than use of 
expensive bank deals
 - focus on reducing cost of external funding
 - creation of an EnronEurope treasury function.


GROSS MARGIN

On the gross margin side, whilst the targets are extremely challenging our 
core business is well positioned provided we can address the excessive cost 
burden.

In respect of the trading side of our business:-
? UK Power continues to be our most significant source of income and whilst 
NETA has created some significant challenges it also raises great 
opportunities for us.
? Continental Power still lacks volatility but we are seeing some reasonable 
earnings.
? Scandinavian Power is a significant opportunity for us and we have made 
$20m so far this quarter and we like the positions we have going forward.
? UK & Continental Gas continue to be difficult - we lack an information 
advantage at this point.
? Metals continues to be a difficult trading market and with the systems 
problems we are having we are taking relatively small positions.

On the origination side (as you will see from the ""hotlist"") we are starting 
to see some significant deal flow particularly in the UK gas and power 
markets.  In addition, there are a number of good renewables opportunities 
together with some interesting opportunities at ETOL and TPL.

On the continent we are also seeing an ever increasing number of deals but 
the big deals are still likely to arise on an opportunistic basis although I 
am very bullish on where certain of the markets will be over the next 18-24 
months.

For the first time we have doable origination deals in Scandinavia and this 
is also an increasing focus for us.

There are some outstanding possibilities for long-term structured Metals 
deals, however most of them have a considerable lead time and I only expect a 
few deals this year while we develop the opportunities/franchise which will 
allow the Metals business to take off in 2002.  I do not expect Metals to be 
anywhere near P&L positive this year but I am extremely bullish on the 
franchise value and the possibilities for significant earnings going forward. 
We have massive resource working on sorting our systems (likely to be 
complete early 2002) and that together with a 30-50% reduction in the 
headcount and costs will allow us to have a sustainable and profitable 
business going forward.

We also have a number of great origination opportunities for Enron Credit, 
particularly on the portfolio side of the business which I expect to develop 
significant earnings this year.

We have disbanded the finance origination group with the individuals becoming 
part of the UK, Continental and Renewables groups to ensure closer focus on 
deals the business units want rather than illiquid positions (where we always 
seem to be giving our money to someone else) that always seem to be the 
preserve of this sort of group.  The extra origination resource will help the 
groups deliver on some good opportunities.

MIDDLE EAST/MARGAUX/CATS

Although, as you know we would argue that these areas should not be for the 
account of Enron Europe, we are working them very hard.

Middle East 

When we took over the Middle East business there was $68.8m of costs on the 
balance sheet with over 30 people developing projects with no realistic 
probability of an acceptable return. The office has been downsized and will 
be purely LNG going forward. We have recovered $3m from Dolphin and have 
served the termination notice to recover a further $25m.  We are fighting 
hard to recover as much as possible of the remaining $15m spent on Dolphin, 
the $22.5m on Gaza and $3m on Oman (and $1m on a deal in Pakistan!).   To the 
extent that we have to take a hit we will manage it over a number of quarters 
(we are in discussion with a number of parties re all the above).

CATS

Fernley and his team worked hard to ensure that the hit for Enron was the 
absolute minimum possible being $20.3m (IBIT) and $13.4m (interest), which 
will have to be taken this quarter. The remaining $108m has been taken to the 
balance sheet as a deferred expense, so this will have a capital charge in 
respect of it going forward.

Margaux/Whitewing

As mentioned above, Enron Europe covered losses of $12.2m in Q1 in respect of 
the Margaux financing.  We are expecting losses in Q2 of approx $14.5m.  We 
have two teams working the situation very hard.  Global finance in London are 
focussing on opportunities to re-finance and/or identify P&L positive 
opportunities from the structure to offset the losses. We have one or two 
interesting possibilities. In addition Eric Shaw has a team totally focussed 
on finding incremental value from the underlying assets to enable us to have 
greater scope to sell the assets.  We need to find somewhere in the region of 
$115m of incremental value to enable us to do this.  We will sell all of the 
underlying assets as soon as it is possible to do so.

JAPAN ENCOM

EnCom has an annual cost base of approximately $10m and the expenditure is 
likely to increase.  It has a number of interesting opportunities that it is 
pursuing but they are extremely long-term and at a very early stage. Our game 
plan is to get ourselves into a position, as quickly as possible, to be able 
to monetise our interest both at the holding company and project levels.

JAPAN ENRON

As you know we believe that the power market will not open quickly enough to 
justify the resource that was going to be focussed on it.  The opportunities 
are clearly in the global markets area.  We will focus on Metals and Enron 
Credit in that region. We will provide commercial support to Global Markets 
and re-charge the costs.

AUSTRALIA

We are not making enough of this market but are adding some very good 
origination resource to enable Paul Quilkey to take advantage of some 
interesting opportunities.



I attach an appendix setting out a more detailed breakdown of our actual 
numbers v plan, Q1 2001 v Q1 2000 on a like for like basis and a more 
detailed expenses and headcount breakdown.

he is switching from the Republican Party to become an Independent voting 
with the Democrats.  If this happens, control of the Senate will switch to 
the Democrats, which will give the Dems a majority and control of the 
Senate.  

? All committee chairs would become Democratic and the Dems would control the 
legislative agenda
 ( Energy bills, California bailout, possible investigation of who influenced 
the Cheney plan etc.).  In a profound ideological  shift, Sen. Murkowski (R- 
AK) would be replaced by Sen. Bingaman (D-NM) as chair of the Senate Energy 
Committee

? The recommendations for loosening regulations for oil/gas drilling, coal 
and power as well as incentives for new generation contained in the Cheney 
bill are likely to be heavily revised in favor of more conservation-oriented 
measures.

? The tax bill will likely be downsized, particularly if Jeffords makes his 
switch immediately.  The timing is important because the Senate-House 
conference on the bill must be appointed immediately.

? All presidential appointments would be controlled by the Dems.  This is 
significant because of the large number of sub-cabinet level appointments 
that need to be approved.

At the same time, Republicans are trying to convince Sen. Zell Miller (D-GA), 
who already votes Republican, to switch to the Republican party.  If this 
happens, it will cancel out the expected Jeffords move.  Initial reports are 
that Miller will not switch.

One other caveat -- Jeffords has pondered a switch in the past and then 
flaked out.  But if Jeffords goes through with it and Miller stays put, the 
balance of power in Washington will be tipped in favor of the Democrats."

I live in Cloquet, Mn. and have been employed by Northern Natural Gas for 20+

The Potlatch Corporation has fallen on difficult financial times. There is

mill has recently gone through a $1 Bil modernization. Included in the 
project is a steam/electric cogen facility. (not sure of capacity) In talking

Source X reports the following regarding the Republican Plan B
proposal:

- Encourage direct access for consumers.  (The problem with this, however,
is that these direct access deals would not have a dedicated rate component,
and too many might undermine the cash flow and credit worthiness of the
bonds.)
- The Republicans will ""suggest"" that generators take a 30% haircut.  ""We
think this is doable.""
- The Republicans strongly oppose purchasing the transmission assets.
- Restore the invetor-owned utility model for generation.  They would
establish a dedicated rate component for construction of native generation
by the utilities.  They would grant ratepayers equity interest in these
plants.
- Resolve the QFs' financial issues.

- Assemblyman Cox commented afterward that the Republcans have been trying
to work on a bilateral basis with the Democrats on these issues, but they
feel ""frozen out.""  Moreover, he senses the Democrats moving back toward
having an option to purchase SoCal's transmission assets, which the
Republicans oppose.

Source reports the following regarding the Democratic Plan B:

- The Democrats are formulating a Plan B that incorporates the Governor's
MOU, the Nation Plan B and other ideas that they have.  This plan reportedly
has not yet been introduced into the legislature yet because it is still
being finalized and the Democrats are not certain that it will work.
Specifically, the option to purchase SoCal's transmission assets is
reportedly still being debated.  Some Democrats reportedly believe that this
may be unnecessary.

- The details of the plan are reportedly as follows:

- Set aside the $3.1 bilion undercollect in a separate account funded by a
dedicated rate component.
- The generators can either get a check instantly from the bonds for 70% of
their claim or they can try to get up to 100% of their claim adjudicated
through a dispute.
- This plan could be used as a template for going to the bankruptcy judge to
strike a deal for PG&E.

- Sources indicate that the Democrats are developing a post-petition plan in
cast SoCal files for bankruptcy, including the following:

- The state would buy both utilities out of bankruptcy.  It then would sell
of pieces of the utilities to various private-sector buyers, but with a
lifetime stipulation on how they will be run.
- Some Democrats reportedly believe the state could do this with as little
as $5 billion if it assumed the utilities' debt and got a cram-down by the
bankrutpcy judge to quell the protests against such a plan that would very
likely erupt.  Democrats reportedly believe that the Judge Montali would
support this idea."

Best estimate- big risk here.  More and more small creditors (QFs, City of

Calif Assembly GOP Releases 'Plan R' To Rescue Elec Utils Updated:
Wednesday, May 23, 2001 04:14 PM ET
LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--California's Assembly Republicans on Wednesday
released ""Plan R"", an alternative to Democratic proposals on how to restore
the state's financially struggling utilities to solvency.
The plan put forth by the Republicans, who are in the minority in the
Assembly, would have Edison International,  Southern California Edison and
PG&E Corp. pay down debts by way of a dedicated-rate component taken from
existing utility rates, including a rate hike effective March 27.
Plan R would also increase the utilities' future return on investment, and
allow for cost recovery in the future, a press release said. The utilities
have incurred more than $14 billion in undercollections because under a rate
freeze they couldn't pass high wholesale power costs to customers. Utility
rates are frozen through March 2002, unless state regulators decide to lift
the freeze sooner.


To help lower rates, utilities would be required under Plan R to produce
more short-term and long-term power as well as sign long-term contracts to
hedge against real-time price spikes. Lower rates would also come from
negotiating reduced prices for power bought from qualifying facilities and
from negotiating with larger generators to accept only 70% of the money they
are owed for past power deliveries.


""The critical element (of a 30% concession) must come from the governor's
leadership,"" said Assembly Republican leader Dave Cox. ""Republicans aren't
going to support any plan without a comparable negotiated concession from
generators by the governor.""


The governor met with generators two weeks ago and asked them to accept 70
cents on the dollar from utilities. Most haven't said definitively whether
they are willing to accept those terms, although Reliant (REI, news, msgs)
has flatly refused to accept less than 100%.


Plan R is a response to Gov. Gray Davis' plan to buy SoCal Ed's transmission
lines for $2.76 billion and to help the utility issue $3 billion in bonds
backed by ratepayer revenue.


""The Republican plan is a shared solution that delivers more power to the
grid. The governor's plan socks ratepayers with a staggering bill for
transmission line junk,"" said GOP Assemblyman Keith Richman.


Davis' agreement with SoCal Ed, announced more than five weeks ago, has
gotten a cold reception from Democrats as well, who have proposed several
""Plan B"" alternatives, two of which are being taken more seriously than
others.


One would have the state hold a five-year option to buy SoCal Ed's
transmission lines for their $1.2 billion book value, and would allow the
utility to sell bonds backed by ratepayers for an amount determined by state
regulators. That plan would also require the utility's creditors to accept
75 cents on the dollar for money owed.


The other Plan B would allow Pacific Gas and Electric to issue bonds secured
by their assets and use the revenue to pay creditors. In turn, the utility
would pay an assessment, essentially a tax that would be used to service its
debt.


The Republicans' Plan R applies to both utilities, a spokeswoman for the
Assembly Republican Caucus said. It is meant, in part, to move things
forward, because the Democratic proposals have encountered slow going as of
late, both Democrats and Republican lawmakers say.


""Plan B has become Plan Backtrack,"" Cox said. ""It is time to consider other
options.""


But the Republican plan doesn't really offer much that is new, noted one
consumer advocate. Democrats are already pushing for generators to accept
less than what they are owed, as well as for long-term contracts and
qualifying-facility price reductions, said Michael Shames of the Utility
Consumers' Action Network.


""The irony of the Republican proposal is that it is remarkably similar to
the one being developed by the Democrats. It would appear as though the
Republicans are trying to use a trick that Bill Clinton mastered - taking
the opposition's idea and calling it his own,"" Shames said.


The plan also doesn't explain how or why utilities would want to get back
into regulated generation, vis-a-vis requiring them to produce more supply,
Shames said. As well, funding the plan within current rates isn't possible,
he said.


""The bottom line is, the Republicans aren't pushing anything new or
exciting. And in one case (funding within give rates), not even feasible.
But I'm glad they are trying. I just wish they'd try harder to do something
in a bipartisan way rather than play political games with the truth,"" Shames

     Employee Referral Program.

     This new site will help you to help Enron find the talent it needs.
     Referrals are one of the best sources of talent for Enron in terms of
     quality and fit with Enron's culture. We have found that referrals
     stay with the company longer and adapt faster than those hired through
     other sources. This site will help us run a world-class employee
     referral program with less work and better results.

     There are also incentives for you. If you refer a candidate who is
     hired, you could be eligible to receive a cash reward of up to $5,000.

     So help someone accelerate their career, make yourself some money, and
     help us realize our mission of being the World's No. 1 Company.

     Check out the site - http://enron.referrals.com/promo.asp - let us
     know what you think -- we want to hear from you. This application
     should make referring easier for you so if you have suggestions that
     would enhance the program, send us an e-mail
     (Referral.Station@enron.com) or contact the Referral Station at (713)

would be willing to take, we have received the following reports:

- It appears at this point that many generators would be disinclined to
accept a 70% haircut without getting something in return.  For instance, 
generators might agree to this in return for immunity from further state 
prosecution for damages, anti-trust issues, etc.

- The 70% haicut ""consensus"" in the legislature should not be overstated. The 
Democrats originally proposed this, and the Republicans yesterday essentially 
said ""me too"" in announcing their Plan B.  However, sources report that there 
remains disagreement in the legislature over this number, despite the fact 
that it is the number most often suggested as of now.

David Oxley and have any comments

Dave Delainey



Following my note last week please find attached the consolidated peer group 
mapping for all business units. This mapping is intended to illustrate from a 
functional view point where each activity was placed at Year End 2000 VP PRC.

We were considering moving to a 3 Peer Group Structure however it as agreed 
at the last PRC Committee Meeting  to stay with the current structure since 
the data had been cleaned and everyone felt generally comfortable where most 
activities had been placed with the exception of just  2 or 3. It was agreed 
that we should concentrate on resolving these rather than undertaking an 
organization wide remapping excercise to consolidate to 3 Peer Groups. All 
functions/activities within the business units should now be reflected on the 
acttached. 

The actions points from this excercise are:

1 to review and agree the attached mapping 

2    consider and comment on highlighted groups that we have discussed in 
previous PRC meetings and ask for your comments or objections to moving them  
as indicated on the attachment.

3 invite your comments or questions on any other function that you consider 
questionable or requiring further explanation.

      Please return your comments to David Oxley by Friday May 25.

      To have this discussion now will save lengthy discussions in the final 
VP/MD PRC Meetings.  Definitions of the peer groups are also attached for 
your ease of
      reference."

* The Power Curve has softened since our last analysis (Power Curve 4,
May 2).  Forward expectations are down 11%, 15% and 9% for 2001, 2002 and
2003, respectively.  The Spark Spread, an important measure of profit
potential, has declined further: down 18%, 32% and 84%, respectively.
* Shape of curve remains ""backwardated"" - decreasing from a peak this
summer.
* Softening trend has continued since January.  This period every
region was affected with California and the West showing the largest
declines.
* Power Producers: most favorable commodity pricing environment this
summer--continue to expect positive earnings surprises 2Q and perhaps 3Q.
* Recommendation to investors:  Expect near-term strength in Producers
keyed off of strong 2Q expectations.  Recommend shifting portfolio toward
Energy Merchants as we move into the summer.  Maintain positive ratings on
both groups of stocks given strong near-term earnings visibility.

As we reported on Wednesday, the 
first glimmers of hope for a deal in the Assembly are starting to appear on 
the horizon.  The market may react positively to this news as it filters out 
over the next week.  Of course, a bailout deal for SoCal could be rejected by 
SoCal or the generators could refuse to participate and bankruptcy could 
still happen.  Nonetheless, we felt it was important to alert you to the 
changing dynamics in the legislature.

RJ

Executive Summary:

? Legislators in both parties are scared about a fiscal meltdown and looking 
for a realistic Plan B
? The Keeley plan is the most likely vehicle and would include the 30% 
generator haircuts and revenue bonds backed by a dedicated rate component
? Despite uncertainty over dealing with transmission lines and continued 
oppostion from Burton and his consumer group allies, the Keeley plan will 
probably pass the legislature
? The generators will not support the plan until they get clearer guarantees 
from the state that investigations and lawsuits will end
? PG&E could get the same offer as SoCal through the bankruptcy court.

1. Budget Binge Could Scare Legislators into a Deal

According to sources, the Assembly is ""terrified""  of the current holes in 
the budget due to buying power.  The impact of the  energy crisis is 
reportedly causing panic among some legislators.  This  panic appears to be 
moving a SoCal bailout plan forward.
 
 Sources report that a modified Plan B deal is  ""not that far off""; it will 
likely take one to two weeks (more likely closer to  two) to move a deal 
through the Assembly and the Senate and to the governor's  desk once it is 
introduced.
 
2. What Would the New Plan B Look Like?

- This modified Plan B deal, which  will originate in the Assembly, will 
almost certainly include a dedicated  rate component to pay SoCal's 
undercollect.  Revenue bonds will be issued  securitized by this dedicated 
rate component.  It is also very likely that  the generators would be offered 
70 cents on the dollar for what they are owed  immediately, with the 
possibility of more if they win litigation.  (Sources  report that the state 
is ""fairly confident"" that at least most generators  would not be successful 
in winning this additional money.)  Assembly Speaker Keeley  reportedly 
remains the driving force behind this plan, and it is being drawn up  from 
within his office.
 
3. Transmission Lines

- It remains unclear at this time whether a  transmission line purchase or 
option to purchase will be put into the deal,  since this is a major point of 
contention between the Democrats and  Republicans.  According to sources, the 
Assembly is ""working on  this.""

4. Plan Looks Good to Pass Both Assembly and Senate 

- According to sources, the vote count for passing  a deal containing the 
above components (except the transmission line purchase,  which is not yet 
settled) ""looks very good.""  The vote in the Senate would  be ""very close.""  
Senator Burton still opposes a bail-out deal, but he  reportedly might not 
stand in the way of others from voting for the  plan, making its passage more 
likely.  Even opponents of the plan  (including Burton and the consumer 
advocates) say that the odds of a modified  Plan B passing the Senate are 
better than 50-50.  These opponents are  reportedly ""pessimistic"" about their 
chances of stopping a Plan B from passing  at this point.

5. Caveat: Generators Are Waiting For Guarantees That the Witch Hunt Will End
 
- As reported previously, sources continue to  believe that generators would 
be reluctant to take a 70 cent-on-the-dollar  haircut without the state 
offering them relief from further prosecution.   (Without this relief, the 
state could give them 70 cents, then try to take away  even more.)  Sources 
report that even opponents of the plan accept that the  generators should be 
offered this relief from prosecution.  Thus, it  appears likely at this time 
that most generators would accept a 30 percent  haircut if they were paid 
immediately.  Also, sources believe that the  securitization on the dedicated 
rate component offered in the modified Plan B  would be sufficient to pay 
back those generators who successfully litigated to  win more than 70 cents 
on the dollar.
 
- Sources believe that SoCal Edison's creditors are  likely to forebear from 
filing an involuntary bankruptcy long enough for this  plan to go through, 
since it would pay back most of what they are  owed.
 
6. PG & E Could Also Be Dealt In
 
- If this plan succeeds, it will almost certainly  be taken to the bankruptcy 
court and offered to PG&E as part of a  reorganization plan.  This plan can 
be offered at any time within  PG&E's ""period of exclusivity.""  This is a 
90-day period (though it is  often extended) following the filing of a 
bankruptcy petition.
 
- However, sources report that the state is  concerned about how to approach 
the bankruptcy court.  Based on Supreme  Court precedent (which legal sources 
within the state have been reviewing), the  state would likely lose its 
sovereign immunity if it entered as a party into the  bankrutpcy court.  This 
is a problem because the stakes in this case are so  high.
 
7. Bailout Bill Would Require Follow Legislation For A New Rate Structure

- Even if the state passes and signs a SoCal  bailout, it would still need to 
pass a rate structure that would allow SoCal and  PG&E to flow through cost 
increases to prevent them from once again facing  bankrtupcy.  Therefore, 
this plan does not make the crisis go  away."

Support KidSave and Help Miracles Happen. Every Summer.
 
Kidsave,s  Summer Miracles Program enables orphaned children ages 5 to 11 to 
travel to the  US and Canada, live with families and attend day camp. The 
program gives  families who may be concerned about the problems of adopting 
an older child a chance to meet, get to know and in the best-case scenario, 
fall in love with a  child. The program gives prospective parents an 
opportunity to see and evaluate  first-hand the challenges and rewards of 
adopting an older  child.
 
In 1999 and  2000 Kidsave and adoption agency partners placed 432 children - 
96 percent of  children who participated in the program. Generally, 85 to 90 
percent of  children who participate in the program find homes easily through 
the program.  The remaining 10 to 15 percent require more work.
 
Kidsave  believes every child deserves a family. We are committed to placing 
all children  who participate in the Summer Miracles Program in permanent 
families or  family-like environments.
 
We are looking  for families to host children, and for others who want to 
help us make the camp  program happen for these 250 children.   As a 
non-profit organization, Kidsave depends on donations to raise the  money to 
bring these children here and find them families.  Please call Tonya Hoppe at 
281.286.8948  or tonya@tonya.cc to get involved in Houston,s  Kidsave 
program.

over the Margaux transaction both to see if we can reduce the outrageous cost 
and also to see if we can find some earnings . We don't have your earnings 
meeting today and I am not sure yet if it is going to be later in the week ( 
when I am out of the office ) so I thought I would give you a heads up on a 
deal we are working on . It is early days and there are some significant 
accounting and timing issues , but we believe that we have found a way to 
reduce our cost's going forward and recognise potentially up to $100million 
of earnings . In brief this will be by unwinding a liability in respect of an 
existing swap  for about $100m less than it will cost to settle the swap and 
pay out the third party debt and equity holders and pay breakage costs . It 
will involve us in taking back some incremental risk and in taking approx 
$230m of debt on balance sheet -I believe this is all manageable . In 
addition the transaction will require third party consents which could take 
time , however we are aiming to close Q2 . We will brief Glisan and Causey 
today as we need some support from them on a couple of issues . This is not 
yet above a 50% probabilty but I am hopeful that this is doable . We will 
keep you informed .

Hertzberg and Keeley announced that they are filing a petition with FERC to 
rehear the April 26th decision regarding price caps.  After going to D.C. and 
meeting with several FERC members, they decided to file for a rehearing.  
Their filing asks that the order should be in affect around the clock instead 
of just during Stage 1, that the actual costs be tied closer to the pricing 
of the product, and anyone that exceeding the cost-based pricing system have 
a 100% penalty.

? Hertzberg and Keeley had a press conference today at 1:30 PST.  Questions 
included the impact of today's ruling and how it would affect Plan B, 
Hertzberg replied he was not sure.    He also indicated that they support the 
Feinstein bill and if the lawsuit or the rehearing efforts do not work, 
legislation is the last chance for price caps.  Hertzberg also indicated that 
he was getting to the point where CA ""may just say no to prices that are too 
high"" (via buyer cartel)."

category of risks. I have been trying to get the VARS  summed in this order 
since we initiated this activity, but we lost our analyst and it has been a 
bit of a struggle.  The table effectively identifies the Construction Risk as 
the major risk not the Guarantees. They are interrelated and I have provided 
a comment on the connectivity.  Brian will be in Houston on Wednesday.  There 
are several issues to discuss on NEPCO.  We should likely meet with you 
and/or Basil to discuss.



Comments and clarifications:  (Thousands 000 Omitted) (Project Life Portfolio 
Summary)

Revenue  VAR ( $12,351)
This VAR is simply the interest rate risk over time

Materials / Equipment VAR ($21,700)
Calculated price risk of Procurement of Materials and Equipment over life of 
Project.  Heavily influenced by the Balance of Plant and bulks as the 
Equipment Island is normally a transfer from the owner  with minimal risk to 
NEPCO

Construction VAR ($43,896) 
This VAR represents the execution risks in engineering, construction and 
start up.  It is influenced by three elements: Definition, Productivity, and 
Timing.  Money spend can be accelerated to avoid Liquidated Damages thus the 
link to guarantees.  The sensitivity of this VAR is primarily the 
availability of  data for engineering timing plus engineering and 
construction labor price and productivity.

Schedule / Performance VAR ($26,177)
This VAR is calculated on the Performance LD's, Schedule LD's, and Aggregate 
Guarantees plus the Warranty.  Due to the timing and segregation of these 
risks, the project life VAR is not so severe.  The risks of LD's especially 
schedule LD's can be often off set by increased spending. 

Total Project VAR ($75,913)
The attachment provides only the P95 VAR, representing near worse case.  We 
also calculate the P75 VAR which is $31,212.  The credit risks of the owner 
and the five major suppliers which is not shown on the attachment must also 
be considered. It is calculated at an additional $31,162.   


An informed buyer would likely calculate the risk in NEPCO to be in range of 
$50 to $100 million and would likely discount the profit stream by this 
amount or ask us to guarantee the contracts.  
 
NEPCO has a project reserve / contingency of $75 million and a profit backlog 
of $131 million plus a warranty reserve on the books."

Today's average laptop with 128MB RAM and a 10GB Hard Drive costs 
approximately $2,500. If you currently own a laptop purchased 3-4 years ago, 
it probably has around 64MB RAM and a hard drive with 4GB or less. Rather 
than spending $2,500 on a new system, you can upgrade your existing laptop to 
today's standards - all at iGo, and for much less. Here's how:  

Add 64MB RAM $280  
Memory (RAM) allows you to run more applications at the same time on your 
laptop - crucial if you're giving a presentation and need to run PowerPoint, 
graphics software and a web browser all at once! 

Increase storage space to 10GB $350  
Don't run out of room on skimpy hard drives - make sure that you have ample 
space for all your important files, applications and documents, by adding 
storage space to your laptop's internal hard drive. 

TOTAL: Approximately $630 
Less than 25% the average price of a brand new laptop!  

But it doesn't stop there(at iGo, we offer one of the industry's largest 
sources of laptop accessories so you can further maximize the performance of 
your laptop with an array of gear. Items such as auto/in-flight adapters,

the following analysis to determine max loss for our portfolio of 
transactions for the balance of 2001.

A Model simulation yields max loss of less than $60 million for our total 
portfolio in 2001.

 Comments:  We ran several simulations in the model with 10,000 trials 
showing a max loss without hedges of $49,500,000 - $52,000,000. In 
otherwords, the  highest possible loss experienced in all runs was less than 
$52 million.  We also ran one simulation at 30,000 trials and the max loss 
did not vary   significantly from the earlier trials. Our conclusion from the 
results of the model runs is that the 1 in 100,000 trial would produce a max 
loss (P99.999) of less  than $60 million vs the notional P100 payout of $280 
million.

 This does not address the ""Venus falling into the Sun"" scenario. Since 
running the simulation does not produce a max loss approaching the P100, we 
had  to go outside the model and create a spread sheet that would force a 
scenario that generated the full loss.

B.  Worst case scenario of all units down on day 1 hits maximum payout of 
$280 million over 5 days.

 Comments: In the spread sheet we assumed an unrealistic scenario that all 
units go down on day one for 5 days. Taking the total MWh covered for each  
unit, we then calculated the power price necessary to hit the maximum dollar 
payout for each unit given a 5 day outage. The 5 day price spike for each  
power market ranged from $1,500 in Entergy to $700 in PJM. Under this 
unrealistic scenario we would reach our maximum payout of $280 million in 5 
days.

C. Power option hedges generate offsetting cash value of $ 215 million, 
reducing our net P100 exposure to less than $65 million

 Comments: We then layered our proposed hedging strategy on top of the 
unrealistic spread sheet scenario in 2 above. Assuming the 5 day price spike  
replicated the forward curve in the MidWest during 1999, a spot market at 
$1,500 pulled forward prices up to a range of $250-$300/MWh. The option   
hedges we would put in place would cost $14-15 million and would yield $215mm 
in positive MTM to offset the payout  of $280 million, giving us the net  
Maximun risk of $65 million.

We need to present our calculations to Vince tomorrow morning to get his sign 
off and can then go over the analysis in detail with you and Greg immediately 
afterwards. We are still not recommending we put the full hedge in place to 
cover this unrealistic scenareo, but the analysis shows we can significantly 
cover the tail risk in our book without having insurance in place. Our 
recommendation remains to put a smaller hedge in place while we continue to 
pursue a insurance partner during the month of June.

Speak to you tomorrow.

You're absolutely correct (obviously), and I actually noted that when I first 
started sending that chart out. I did that so that they would be more in 
scale and fit on the same chart. The chart is provided only to identify the 
trend of our performance relative to the NYMEX. Perhaps I should note each 
day that these volumes have been adjusted so as not to be misleading. Or, if 
you wish, I could stop adjusting the numbers and just chart the absolute 
values.
Please let me know which you would prefer.

Thank you,
Jennifer McQuade"

and a half and thought it would be a good idea to bring you up to speed on 
where they are heading.

1). We now have the complete API to them, but it is hooked up to their test 
environment. They will be sending us a contract to sign before they connect 
it to their production site. He assured me it will be the same contract that 
all the founders have to sign to get access to it. Esentially, if we trade or 
provide prices the API will be free; if we are voyeurs then we will have to 
pay for it.

2). He stated that charging commssion is not a denfensible business model. 
They will try to make their money through mid and back office services.

3). Their purchase of the IPE is directly related to implementing 2). his 
vision is to use the IPE infrastrucutre to make all derivative trades cleared 
and then use the FCM's to fulfill the back office movemment of funds tasks. 
In a nutshell he beleives the FCM's are all interconnected and used to moving 
money around for settlements and margins through the clearinghouse, so why 
not expand their role.

4). When I expressed some skepticism about 3). he asked if we would like to 
participate in a forum with other ICE members to discuss shared mid and back 
ofice services. I told him we would.

If anyone has any questions about this let me know.

We are one @Enron

Effective Friday December 22, 2000, you will have a new Security Request 
Database:

In the past, Enron Corporate/North American users have used the Security 
Resource Request System (SRRS) lotus notes database for their security 
request needs including New Hire/Contractor/Temporary access and 
Terminations. In response to the business reorganization, the IT Security and 
Controls group is working to streamline Enron,s Security Request structure 
and create one single request database for all groups to use, eRequest, 
located at http://itcentral.enron.com/

Please click on the following link to retrieve the eRequest training guide:  

http://itcentral.enron.com/data/services/training/documentationurl/

A great deal of effort has been put into this project to eliminate any 
duplicate security requests in Enron's Global Enterprise.  When you attempt 
to access the SRRS through Lotus Notes on Dec. 22, you will find a link to 
the new eRequest system.  

If you have additional questions regarding your new security request or if 
you have any problems with the eRequest system, please contact Information 
Risk Management at 713.853-5536.

MEMORIES
""My father coached me in Little League baseball, he was a member of the
booster club. He was always very involved, and he would come to all the
games in high school and college, no matter where we were playing. He was my
toughest critic, but also my biggest supporter. My fondest memory was during
my sophomore year in college. I went down and worked out at the Phillies
complex in Florida before the Mount Union baseball team went down there for
our spring trip. My father went down and spent the whole week with me. He
loved baseball and to enjoy that atmosphere with him was very meaningful.""
-- Texans Coach Dom Capers on his relationship with his father

""My dad and I are very different people, and about the only thing we have in
common is our love of sports. He calls me every week, and we talk for about
an hour. Probably 80 percent to 90 percent of what we talk about is

? Edison's MOU Condemned at this Friday's CPUC Meeting
? The Idle Plan Z 
? Angelides Hides State Budget Concerns 
? House Committee to Vote on Energy Relief

Edison's MOU Doubtful
The unusually calm settling over the California legislature about SoCal 
Edison's potential bankruptcy has finally affected the relentlessly 
optimistic investment bank analysts and other company shareholders.  We have 
reported that through all plans from B-Z, there is not a solid plan to save 
this company and now executives are even more fearful that this predictions 
may come to fruition.

Over the last few days, Edison executives have begun pointing hard at the 
CPUC meeting this Friday as a make-or-break event for the company.  The is 
because after the meeting, Davis's MOU plan to buy SoCal's grid will have no 
chance of preventing a potential bankruptcy.  This plan is essentially dead 
although Governor Daivs has yet to say this in a press releases.  The final 
nail will happen after the CPUC adjourns its Friday meeting without voting on 
several necessary MOU provisions.  Unless the CPUC makes a last minute, 
emergency - amendment to their agenda,  the deal will be dead (despite 
SoCal's support for letting the deal stand past its deadline).  Sources 
indicate that CPUC President Loretta Lynch holds reservations on the MOU and 
continues to distance herself from Davis.  

Attempting to influence policy making, Edison executives have spent the last 
few investor phone conferences warning that June 8 would see substantially 
increased risks for a creditor-induced bankruptcy if the Davis plan dies at 
CPUC.  This is interesting, since no one else seems to have been focused on 
the date until Edison began mentioning it late last week.  However, there is 
no more or less threat of bankruptcy than there is now or will be in two 
weeks.   As reported several times earlier, most everyone had given up on the 
MOU long before this Friday's CPUC meeting.

Plan Z Shows Little Progress
Meanwhile, the unhurried pace toward a Plan Z that we reported last Friday, 
has gained little progress.  Legislators continue to pin-point a plan that 
will secure re-election votes and at the same time, weigh the need for rate 
hikes for California's corporate and home electricity users.  As they hash it 
out, the state is spending even more on electricity purchases.  In spite of 
better than expected levels of conservation, the state's electricity 
expenditures over the last month rose to an average of $79M/day. The recent 
rate increases mean more spending by the state and that calls into question 
the reassuring Angelides scenario for California's budget prospects later 
this year.

The California Budget Crunch
Even more worrisome than a idle Plan Z is increasing evidence that last 
month's conference call with State Treasurer Angelides was a little 
misleading. During that conference call Angelides claimed that State 
Comptroller Connell and many in the financial committee had the numbers 
wrong.  Angelides argued that $7.2B already spent to buy power since January 
was really the total amount of authorized spending through late August.  In 
fact, he said only $4.3B of that had been ""spent.""  Sources now indicate that 
 Angelides was technically correct if you use ""spent"" to mean only the amount 
of money for which checks had been written.  This is different than the 
amount of money California had already promised to energy suppliers who had 
already supplied energy to the state.  In fact, when Angelides was speaking 
the state had in fact already promised to pay $7B for energy it had already 
consumed (the total committed has topped $8B.)  By the time the state gets 
its ""power bonds"" auctioned in August, they will have already spent all $12B 
and be back to dipping into the General Fund.   The idea of RANs being 
auctioned before the power bonds get issued is still an option if the general 
fund doesn't make it to August. 

The nearest answer to both of these cash flow deficits lies in part in the 
painful process that the legislature is undertaking now - another round of 
huge electricity rate hikes to securitize debt issuance.  Then the hope is 
that those hikes bridge the gap between now and when new capacity brings 
wholesale rates down and the debts can be repaid.   The only near term path 
to bringing generating assets on line immediately is the 3,500 MW from QF 
plants which are off line because of cash flow problems.  Settling their 
needs is wrapped up in settling the PG&E and Edison trade creditor issues, 
which makes the legislature's leisurely approach to the rate hike/haircut 
situation all the more troublesome.

Energy Relief
The House Energy & Commerce Committee is scheduled to vote on H.R. 1647 (the 
Emergency Electricity Relief Act) tomorrow at 10:00 am.  The bill which was 
twice postponed and does not include any provisions on price caps, but during 
the course of the mark-up, sources indicate that it is possible, even likely, 
that a Democrat could offer a price cap amendment.  Rep. Waxman (D-CA) 
offered a price cap amendment at an earlier mark-up of the bill at the 
subcommittee level.  The Waxman amendment was rejected along party lines (all 
Republicans and 2 Democrats voted nay).  Sources inside Joe Barton's office 
report that staff and members have been meeting to work out a compromise on 
the price cap issue, but nothing has been resolved. As of this afternoon, 
those discussions have been terminated in favor of an open discourse in the 
Committee tomorrow.  Since an agreement was not reached, compromise language 
is not expected to be offered as an amendment tomorrow.  If it is, it would 
not be something that leaders on the Republican and Democrat sides have 
crafted together and therefore would not likely pass.  Sources indicate that 
the committee does expect Waxman, and possibly others to offer price cap 
language, but it is not expected to pass."

the Tax Department that it intended to audit the tax returns for Risk 
Management & Trading Corp. (""RMT"") for  the 1998 through 2000 tax years.  
Greg, this is the legal entity about which I spoke to you several months ago 
and of which you serve as its Senior Management.  We were recently notified 
by the State of Texas that it had completed its audit and review of RMT's 
returns and that NO ADJUSTMENTS would be proposed.  As I outlined in my 
earlier memo to Wes, the RMT arrangement has increased earnings of Enron by 
approximately$30 million since 1997.  The Tax Department is extremely proud 
of our defense of Enron's interests in this matter and I would be delighted 
to speak with you about this should you desire.  Best regards.  SHD."

HOUSTON, Dec. 15 (LocalBusiness.com) -- Enform technology, a high-tech 
consultant, said it has expanded the company's strategic partnership with Sun 
Microsystems Inc. Privately held Enform said Palo Alto, Calif.-based Sun 
Microsystems (Nasdaq: SUNW) is letting the company employ its integrator 
technology called iForce eIntegrators, for use in creating Web applications 
and building back-end systems that connect to the site. Sun will help Enform 
build its service offerings and create custom consulting services, which will 
be jointly marketed.  How much more business this will bring to Enform is not 
clear, and company officials today were not available to discuss the deal. 
Enform, which is run by John McNevin, a former partner at Ernst & Young, has 
grown quickly in its three-year existence. The Houston company helps 
businesses reinvent themselves by upgrading their systems or finding new 
technologies they need to remain competitive. Since its inception, Enform has 
apparently been profitable. It hasn't needed any venture capital to operate. 
The company has about 200 employees, with branch offices in Dallas and 
Austin, and expects to post sales of about $21 million this year. Enform 
recently told LocalBusiness.com that it expected to log about $100 million in 
sales next year, if the economy holds. Its client list includes Microsoft 
Corp., Engage Energy and Continental Airlines."

OUT AND ABOUT 
The season's final installment of Houston Texans Monday Night Football is 
this Monday, Dec. 18, at Jillian's at the Marq?E Entertainment Center. The 
Buccaneers host the Rams in a rematch of last January's NFC Championship Game.

NFL Alumni including Ken Houston, Bubba McDowell and John Shumacher will 
serve as celebrity waiters from 7-8 p.m. Their tips will go to Caring For 
Kids, NFL Alumni's charity of choice. In addition, the first 100 guests in 
the Jillian's video cafe will receive a holiday gift. Those gifts include 
Jillian's Party Packs, a Marq?E Entertainment Center prize package and Texans 
footballs autographed by Bob McNair and Charley Casserly. Academy Sports & 
Outdoors will also give away two grand prizes -- a $500 Academy shopping 
spree and a set of Wilson golf clubs.

Join the Texans in celebrating a great season of food, football and fun this 
Monday night! 

TOUCHDOWN CLUB AWARDS DINNER 
Texans Executive Vice President/General Manager Charley Casserly was the 
keynote speaker Wednesday night at the Houston Touchdown Club,s 21st Annual 
High School Awards Dinner at the JW Marriott on Westheimer. The Texans, as 
well as coaches from 29 college football programs, joined the Touchdown Club 
in recognizing Houston,s best gridiron performances from the 2000 season.

Coach of the Year honors went to The Woodlands, Weldon Willig, who led the 
Highlanders to an 11-3 mark and their third consecutive District 15-5A 
championship. Klein Forest RB Yamar Washington took home Offensive Player of 
the Year honors. Jersey Village LB Shawn Brooks won Defensive Player of the 
Year honors and Jaxson Appel of Friendswood earned the Iron Man Award for 
best two-way player in the city. 

? 
Casserly told the gathering of players, coaches and parents that they should 
all be proud of what they collectively accomplished. But in addressing the 
players he also did a little coaching himself. 

&Some of you won't play football again. Some of you will go on to play in 
college and some of you might play in the NFL,8 Casserly said. &But in each 
instance your primary goal should be academics. Think about it, if you have a 
Hall of Fame career in football, your career will be over 15 years from now 
-- even if you're one of the best players in the history of the game. You 
have to have something to fall back on.

&You need to stay in college all four years and get a degree. If you're good 
enough to play in the NFL, it will always be there.8

CASSERLY JOINS IN 
Earlier in the week, Casserly visited the NFL Films offices in Mount Laurel, 
N.J. ESPN analyst and former Eagles QB Ron Jaworski was about to tape his 
weekly Edge NFL Matchup Internet show for NFL.com and asked Casserly to join 
him. Jaworski talked to Casserly during the episode,s final 10 minutes. You 
can watch the show in its entirety on HoustonTexans.com.

I was talking with George Wasaff yesterday and he recommended I touch base 
with you in an effort to identify potential Enron interest in acquiring 
WaterDesk assets.

WaterDesk Corp.  was incubated by Azurix  to provide participants in the 
global water industry with a global, single-source, collaborative, 
business-to-business network to efficiently source, transact and manage, 
information, products and services.  We are currently involved in a private 
placement process that does portend some significant possibility for success 
but has not had anyone circle an offer yet.  Time is of the essence.  Given 
current market and industry realities, our priorities have changed in an 
effort to maximize near term opportunity for success. Specifically, in 
addition to offering investors the opportunity to invest in a public 
marketplace solution, we are pursuing other avenues, such as private 
marketplace or buy-side procurement solutions (which seem to be more 
palatable).  We are also broadening our opportunity set by seeking potential 
solutions outside the water industry. Feedback from the various and numerous 
entities that have performed due diligence on WaterDesk  indicate that its 
assets are well suited for any of these alternative solutions.

KEY ELEMENTS OF VALUE:  a qualified and experienced team; intellectual 
property; and, a secure, integrated and operational platform.  

Bottom Line: I have committed to John Garrison that we will deliver some form 
of success by February or we should ""pull the plug"".  It would be a pity to 
waste such valuable assets (human and physical).  I would like to meet with 
your or your designated representative(s) as soon as possible to determine 
what fit, if any, there might be with Enron endeavors, current or future.  

The attached provides some detailed information that may be of help as you 
reflect on this.

* While we do not expect a direct rate increase or removal of the rate
freeze for EIX or PCG out of the California Public Utility Commission
meeting today, we are encouraged by the conciliatory tone of recent
comments.
* In our view, acerbic rhetoric has finally given way to pragmatic
reconciliation and it now appears that California utilities are on the path
towards effectively receiving the rate increases they require to remain
solvent.
* We believe this has implications not only for the health of the
affected utilities, but also for the Growth Energy Merchants and Competitive
Generators.
* While the credit risk associated with utilities' power market
purchases have not been solved yet, the credit risk in the California market
has eased somewhat.
* While trading may be choppy as the final California remedy is
hammered out, we recommend the purchase of the Growth Energy names
throughout any near-term weakness possible as a result of the process.
* Decision expected today at 4:00 PM EST.

* California regulators indicated yesterday that they are willing to
raise rates for electric utilities EIX and PCG,  following a review of their
finances
* Hearings to review utilities' financial status in hearings on Dec.
27 and 28
* KEY DATE:  January 4, when we expect they will vote to raise rates
* We see this action as positive for the utilities, because it reduces
the likelihood of insolvency or bankruptcy, although further action is
required, in our view
* We also see it as positive for our Growth Energy companies.  Any
reduction in financial pressure on the utilities equates to reduced pressure
to re-regulate the wholesale power industry, in our view
* The results of the action were in line with our expectation; we
recommend investors buy the Growth Energy names on weakness.  In particular,
we highlight DYN, CPN, NRG, SOE and DUK.

I found that by reducing the volume per trade and increasing daily number of 
trades ( keeping the 
total volume per day constant), we can be more profitable.  This is partially 
because in a trending market
we lose less money by following the market more closely. For example, suppose 
market move from
$30 to $35. If per trade volume is 10,000 BBL, we take 6 trades of short 
positions, the total MTM for that
day is (-5-4-3-2-1)*10,000=-$90,000 and total trading volume is 60,000 BBL.
 If per trade volume is 60,000 BBL, we take one trade, the total MTM is 
-5*60,000= -$300,000.

Therefore it seems that by reducing per trade volume and increasing the 
number of trades, we can be more
profitable as a market maker.  

I rerun a scenario that Stinson sent to you on Dec. 27 where he used per 
trade volume of 30,000 BBL.
I reduce the number of trade to 10,000 while increasing the number of trades 
by 3.  Almost in all
cases, I saw increased profitability.  See the colume marked ""Change"" for 
dollar amount change.

Please let Stinson or me know your thoughts on this.

Greg and John,

I found that by reducing the volume per trade and increasing daily number of 
trades ( keeping the 
total volume per day constant), we can be more profitable.  This is partially 
because in a trending market
we lose less money by following the market more closely. For example, suppose 
market move from
$30 to $35. If per trade volume is 10,000 BBL and the half bid-offer spread 
is $1 for simplicity, we take 5
 trades of short positions, the total MTM for that day is 
(-5-4-3-2-1)*10,000=-$150,000 and total trading 
volume is 50,000 BBL short.  If per trade volume is 50,000 BBL, we take one 
trade, the total MTM is 
-5*50,000= -$250,000.   Thus the net difference between the two trading 
strategies is $10,000 for that
particular day.

Therefore it seems that by reducing per trade volume and increasing the 
number of trades, we can be more
profitable as a market maker.  

I rerun a scenario that Stinson sent to you on Dec. 27 where he used per 
trade volume of 30,000 BBL.
I reduce the number of trade to 10,000 while increasing the number of trades 
by factor of 3.  Almost in all
cases, I saw increased profitability.  See the colume marked ""Change"" for 
dollar amount change in millions.

Please let Stinson or me know your thoughts on this.

,01/15/2001,,eleader@mail.echampions2000.com,gwhalle@ect.enron.com,,An Important eChampion Message,"Dear Friends,

President-elect Bush has brought together an excellent group to serve as his
Cabinet.  His nominees are a diverse, experienced, and strong group.  They
will help enact his agenda, change the tone in Washington and make us proud.

Your help is needed to get these outstanding men and women confirmed by the
United States Senate.  Some of President-elect Bush's nominees are being
unfairly attacked by outside groups and the Senate needs to hear that from
you.

One of the first Senate hearings will be Tuesday for Senator John Ashcroft,
President-elect Bush's choice for Attorney General.

The hallmark of Senator Ashcroft's long history of public service has been
integrity.  As Attorney General, he will uphold the law and make the
Department of Justice an institution all Americans can be proud of.

He brings a unique record of service to this challenge.  He was twice
elected Missouri's Attorney General, serving with both Republican and
Democrat Governors.  He was elected Governor of Missouri, an important swing
state, and then reelected with 64% of the vote.  John then was elected to
the U.S. Senate, where he just finished a six-year term.  No other Attorney
General has ever had this wealth of experience.

John has a long history of strong leadership on important issues, including:

- Won widespread acclaim for his effectiveness in running the Missouri
Attorney General's office by attracting strong men and women to serve his
state and strictly upholding the law
- As Senator, co-Sponsored the Violence Against Women Act
- As Governor, signed Missouri's first Hate-Crimes Bill and fought to
protect victims' rights
- Balanced the State Budget all eight years As Governor
- Made Education Reform a priority as Governor
- Toughened penalties for crimes committed with a Gun
- Worked To protect children at school, strengthen classroom safety
- Voted For background checks at pawn shops
- Was Endorsed By Missouri Law Enforcement Agencies
- Supported 26 of 28 African-Americans nominated to the Federal bench
- Was commended as Governor by one of the oldest Black Bar Associations for
his record of appointing minorities
- Appointed many African-Americans to Missouri's courts
- Was one of the first Governors to sign a law creating a Martin Luther King
holiday
- Created an award honoring George Washington Carver's Accomplishments,
saved Lincoln College, an historic Black college founded by African-American
veterans of the Civil War.

Some groups are attacking Ashcroft for opposing the nomination of Judge
Ronnie White to a lifetime appointment as a Federal judge. Every Republican
Senator opposed White's confirmation, in part, because he urged a lower
legal standard for a man convicted of first-degree murder 4 times (including
the first degree murder of three police officers).

Some groups charge Ashcroft will not uphold abortion laws with which he
disagrees.  This is wrong and simply an attempt to undermine the new
Administration.  Ashcroft understands the job of the Attorney General is to
carry out the letter of the law.   He will restore the rule of law to the
Justice Department and run a highly professional department.

Please do two things.

First, let your Senator know you strongly support a fair confirmation
process for John Ashcroft.

Go to http://www.senate.gov/senators/senator_by_state.cfm to find the
contact information for the Senators from your state.

Second, let the members of the Senate Judiciary Committee know you support
John Ashcroft's confirmation.  The committee begins its hearings Tuesday.
Its members are: http://www.senate.gov/~judiciary/members.htm

D(NJ) Torricelli, Robert, (202) 224-3224 
senator_torricelli@torricelli.senate.gov

Finally, two recent comments from current United States Senators:

Senator Robert Torricelli (D-NJ) had this to say about the Ashcroft
nomination:

""'I think it represents a very good choice'. . . the only things people want
in an attorney general are 'good management, sound judgment and high
integrity.  They're not easy to find in one individual, but I think John
Ashcroft has all of them.'""  ""I certainly assume I will be voting for
him.""  - Sen. Robert Torricelli (D-NJ) (David Kocieniewski, ""Staunch Democrat
Eases Up on Opposition,"" The New York Times, January 6, 2001; Audrey Hudson,
""Democrats Set For Ashcroft's Confirmation,"" The Washington Times, January
4, 2001) (emphasis added)

Senator Kent Conrad (D-ND) Commended Ashcroft.

""I rise to pay tribute to Senator John Ashcroft as he prepares to leave the
Senate. . . . Senator Ashcroft has been a man of his word who served his
state and his country with distinction.  I join my colleagues on both sides
of the aisle in wishing him well in his future endeavors.""  (Congressional
Record, December 15, 2000)

Thank you.

(Please forward this message to friends, family and co-workers and ask them
to show their support for President-elect Bush by asking their U.S. Senators
to support the confirmation of John Ashcroft)"

The report attempts to view various assets and positions entirely on an

exhaustive since the universe of economic exposure is significant but if 
useful we will spread the net. 

Here are the highlights:

Enron stock option plans: 

ENE is low and volatility is around 45 - 50%. We are working with Global 
Finance and Accounting on a hedging proposal.

J Block CRTA:

We have not factored in the impact of yesterday's House of Lords ruling on 
this contract.

USD/KRW has gone from 1205 to 1368. Economic outlook is bleak. Enron's

Summary:

* Britain's Crown Estate (hereditary possessions of the Royal family)
has granted seventeen UK companies the option to build wind power generation
projects with a potential value of U$2.3 billion on their land.  Wind
turbine sites have been approved for several regions ranging from Scotland
to the south coast of England, however government and regulatory approval
remains necessary for the projects to go ahead.
* BP, together with the government of Spain and the Phillipines, plan
to build a $48 million solar power plant that will deliver electricity to
over 150 villages (400,000 residents) that are isolated in the Phillipines.
The system will be installed in two separate installments, the first of
which is planned for September.

* We would not sell Energy Merchants/Power Producers on news that PCG
has declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy.
* Ongoing payments in California are being made by the state;
therefore do not anticipate material exposure for ongoing earnings.
* Primary exposure is current receivables: (1) these one-time amounts
are limited (roughly estimate max. of 50% of 2001 earnings); and (2) we
expect that, as trade creditors, they will get high priority in a bankruptcy
proceeding. We think most of these amounts are likely to be recoverable,
although a significant (perhaps several year) delay is possible as these
claimants work their way through the bankruptcy process.
* By our rough estimation, companies with fairly significant one-time
earnings exposure include:  NRG, MIR, DYN, CPN.  Companies with fairly small
exposure include:  ENE, AES, WMB, EPG and DUK.

cooperation was needed on fuel cell technology development as it pertains to
vehicles in order to commercialize the technology for this application.
While Toyota continues to develop hybrid vehicles, Watanabe believes fuel
cell vehicle technology has high hurdles to overcome.  In February the
automaker unveiled a prototype fuel cell vehicle, the FCHV-3, which also
includes a secondary nickel-metal hydride battery.

folks involved on your deal team but I do know this deal would not have 
happened had it not been for you three! I remember when we started this last 
July (remember the $1 DASH ?!), the hurdles that kept popping up (oh, just a 
little bankruptcy proceeding), and the s-l-i-c-k structuring of the entire 
transaction. Bought if for $3.5 million, sold it for $26 million, marked an 
incremental $5 million on a coal contract, and still have the right to 
""broker"" another sale and keep 90% of the proceeds ( another $10+ million)!!

Summary:

* U.S. President George W. Bush unveiled his National Energy Policy
today.  In our report we list the recommendations made by the National
Energy Policy Development Group (NEPD) as they pertain to Renewable and
Alternative Energy.  In addition, following each recommendation, we provide
our views on the potential impacts on specific CSFB covered companies
(AstroPower - APWR, Ballard Power Systems - BLDP, Capstone Turbine - CPST,
FuelCell Energy - FCEL, Proton Energy Systems - PRTN) in the Energy
Technology sector.
* We would note that many of the recommendations instruct certain
departments or individuals to conduct further research on various topics and
to report back to the President at a later date.  Our view is that many were
included as a counter point to more contentious issues and may receive
somewhat limited action from the Administration.
* Overall, we are not changing our estimates or recommendations on any
of our companies at this point in time.  The proposed solar tax credit
when/if passed will cause us to review our forecasts for AstroPower.  We are
not forecasting incremental unit volume of production given the capacity
constraint of the company, although residential installations tend to have a
higher revenue per watt and higher margins than non-residential markets and
therefore could result in higher EPS contribution.

* ENE has underperformed its peer group of Energy Merchants.  Stock
price down 39% from 52-week high ($90 on August 23) vs. peer group, up 1.9%.
* We reiterate our Buy rating on the stock, and believe the weakness
is largely due to concern over ENE's group-high P/E multiple and PEG ratio
of 27x and 1.3x, respectively (group average 19x and 1.0x), coupled with a
series of concerns over various parts of Enron's business: bandwidth, India,
etc.
* Our sense is that the bandwidth unit is performing on target, and is
likely to beat the strong numbers posted last quarter.  India, while a
significant issue, remains a small part of Enron's asset base (about 4%).
It is a legacy business, in our view, and does not materially affect our
overall view of the company.
* We see ENE's business fundamentals intact, and in fact, improving.
Growth rate expansion to 25% from 20%; growing returns on capital; bandwidth
trading all good reasons to own stock -- justify premium valuation.

* We initiate coverage of Aquila, Inc. with a 1H (Buy, High Risk)
rating and a 12-month price target of $44.
* Aquila is a pure-play Energy Merchant, leveraging their strong
trading and risk management skills in the rapidly growing energy commodity
markets.  Aquila was an early mover into these deregulating markets, and has
shown strong traction over recent years, which we believe is sustainable
long-term.
* We project a 20-25% growth rate for ILA driven by our robust outlook
for wholesale energy and the potential for successful expansion into new
commodities and geographies.
* At a 2002 0.7x P/E-to-growth (PEG) ratio, ILA is trading at a
significant discount to their Energy Merchant peer average of 1.0x. Based on
its strong track record and potential for industry-leading earnings growth,
we place a PEG value on ILA of 1.0x 2002 earnings, leading to our $44 price
target.

Operationally, we are doing great, with tremendous press coverage (USA
Today, CNN, Newsweek, Boston Globe, etc...), growing traffic, and lots of
praise for our site and concept.  On the business development front, we are
now talking seriously with eBay about a distribution arrangement and with
Northwest about expanding to their full route system.

Meanwhile, we are running out of cash.  The money we've got in the bank will
last through early August (assuming an orderly shut-down).  In order to keep
our business development efforts alive, we're trying to raise $500k at a low
valuation in the next 30 days.  Would you be willing to consider a portion
of this amount as a personal investment?

Attached is an up-to-date overview of where we stand.

Best,

? SoCal. Ed MOU Introduced as Bill
? House Committee Douses Emergency Energy Relief Act

MOU Has Its Day
Sources report that California Senator Polanco has introduced the legislation 
today for the MOU between the Governor and SoCal Edison (SB 78XX).  As 
reported earlier, sources still believe that there is not sufficient 
legislative support for this measure to pass.  Senator Polanco's political 
career was earlier jeopardized by personal scandal and now sources feel his 
MOU sponsorship may be nothing more than a quid pro quo attempt to gain 
support from Davis.  Additionally, the CPUC has added two necessary MOU 
provisions to its next week voting agenda, though support for these issues 
remains weak on the CPUC board.   

House Energy Relief Efforts
The House Energy and Commerce Committee gave up plans to ease California's 
energy woes because Republicans and Democrats could not settle a long 
standing debate over price caps in the West.  Representative Waxman admitted 
a compromise was never more than a noble idea throughout the debates, and 
several delayed mark-up sessions for the bill.  Barton noted the bill had 
little chance of aid California considering the time it would take to pass 
the bill would be longer than the California summer."

 Attached is the DASH for the approval of the DPR Accelerated Put 
transaction.  This partial divestiture allows us to put $11 million of our 
equity interest back to DPR Holding Company, LLC and its subsidiary, Dakota, 
LLC.  Both entities are controlled by Chris Cline.

 In addition to redeeming part of our equity interest, the deal provides us 
900,000 tons of coal priced below market, an option which could lead to a 
very profitable synfuel project, and the potential for more marketing fees 
from other Cline entities.

 The DASH has been approved and signed by RAC and JEDI II, and is now 
awaiting Mark Haedicke's review and approval.  I wanted to give you the 
opportunity to review the DASH and become familiar with the provisions of the 
deal.

 If you have any questions on the transaction, feel free to contact me at 
(412) 490-9048.  Others familiar with the deal are Mike Beyer, George 
McClellan, and Wayne Gresham.

new 10 percent tax bracket carved out from the previous 15 percent bracket) 
without a reduction to the amount currently withheld under the Federal 
withholding tax regime, all taxpayers are slated to receive a rebate of taxes 
that otherwise would have been paid this year - this is the $300, 500 or 600 
""tax refund"" that you may have heard of in connection with the Law.  The 
attached documents describe in greater detail the changes I have just 
described.  As always, I can be reached at x30938 should you have any 
questions.  Best regards.  SHD."

,06/08/2001,,gwdorsey@aol.com,whalley@enron.com,,Trade Development,"In March I left a message for you explaining that I was accepting an offer  
from ElPaso. That decision followed my having brought together the pieces of  
a project that John Nowland indicated Enron was not prepared to consider and  
my subsequent presentation of the project to ElPaso who embraced the deal. 

John indicated that the 90 day delay he inserted into our discussions  
resulted from your having considered Trammo. I understand that Trammo is no  
longer a target for Enron and wondered, therefore, if our getting together  
for an hour would be timely. 
The industry still presents a target rich environment and you are still the  
biggest horse in the race.

2001. 

The contents of the GMM are contained in the Executive Summary below:

? US: Legislative momentum building for price caps.  Some prominent 
economists are advocates.  
? Europe: ECB holds again, acknowledging that price pressures are likely to 
persist over the next few months.  By setting inflation expectations above 
its stated target for the remainder of 2001, the ECB has afforded itself some 
flexibility in setting interest rates to combat the economic slowdown.  
Europe,s manufacturing sector continues to display weakness, suggesting that 
recovery of Europe,s industrial sector may be well behind the U.S. 
? UK: As expected, the BOE left interest rates unchanged at 5.25 percent at 
its MPC meeting this week.  The pound reacted to speculation and political 
factors this week.  PM Blair,s repeat landslide victory on Thursday and his 
pre-election comments renewed an old debate regarding UK,s entry into the 
euro region.  The pound is too strong to join the common currency, and it 
must weaken further in order to assure export competitiveness of British 
manufacturers.    
? Country Update - Argentina: The bond swap that closed earlier this week 
buys the Argentine government time to reduce its fiscal deficit.   But the 
wave of optimism following the swap of short- for longer- term debt 
repayments may wash ashore if Argentina cannot meet its IMF fiscal targets 
this year.  The debt exchange prompted S&P to remove Argentina,s foreign 
currency sovereign credit ratings from CreditWatch on Wednesday June 6 (in 
place since March 19, 2001). 
? Country Update - Brazil: Brazil,s drastic power rationing plan could impact 
the short-term supply of some of Brazil,s major exports, including steel and 
pulp products.  Consumers must cut energy consumption by 20 percent and 
Industry by between 15 to 25 percent until at least October 2001.
Credit Ratings Activity - India and Mexico:  Fitch adjusted downward its 
outlook on India,s sovereign ratings to negative from stable on concerns 
about fiscal policy, privatization and a deterioration in the foreign 
investment climate.  S&P,s outlook for Mexico remains positive.  But, Mexico 
needs to improve its public finances before the rating agency will upgrade 
Mexico to investment grade.  Mexico,s foreign currency sovereign is rated 
&BB+,8 one notch below investment grade.

,06/12/2001,,enron.announcements@enron.com,all.worldwide@enron.com,,Business-Wide Cost Saving Opportunities,"At Enron, we,re good at a lot of things:  making markets, commoditizing 
products, managing risk, offering innovative energy solutions to customers ) 
the list goes on and on.  However, one of the things we could do a lot better 
is watching our expenses.  We,re all shareholders in this company, and we 
need to spend our company,s dollars as wisely as we spend our own.

There are some simple, yet significant measures each of us can take to make 
sure we,re careful with Enron,s money.  The Policy Committee has approved and 
recommended the following:

? Professional Services ) This is our largest area of discretionary spending, 
at more than $600 million last year. &Professional Services8 includes our 
contracts with outside law and accounting firms, contractors and other 
consulting groups.  To make sure that we are negotiating the best rates and 
terms of service for the company across business units, we are requiring all 
future professional service contracts and those up for renewal to be 
negotiated through or in consultation with Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS), 
effective July 1.  In addition, contracts for more than $5,000 must be 
pre-approved by the business unit senior executive or their designee and 
GSS.  For more information, see http://ibuyit.enron.com.

? On-line expense reporting tool XMS ) XMS, our online expense reporting 
tool, enables us to expedite, monitor and report expenses.  Effective July 1, 
all employees on domestic U.S. payroll will be required to use XMS for 
reimbursement of business-related expenses. To access XMS, go to 
http://xms.enron.com/.  

? Enterprise wide portal ) We currently have 122 internal web sites across 
the company.  The amount of technology work, marketing collateral, and other 
related costs required to develop and support so many portals is sizeable.  
It makes sense to have one Enron portal so you can efficiently access content 
and services through a single, personalized channel that will make it easier 
for you to find information and perform basic tasks online.  This new 
company-wide portal, under the leadership of Tony Mends, will be launched in 
several phases beginning this fall.  

Another significant area where we can be more diligent in our spending is 
travel and entertainment.  Enron has long had travel policies in place.  As 
we have grown, we have not done as well as we should have in communicating 
those policies to new employees and reminding all employees to take advantage 
of the discounts we have negotiated.  The availability of discounts and 
booking services online should make it easy to save money for the company 
without sacrificing the comfort of employees who travel.  The following are 
common sense recommendations that we should all adhere to when traveling for 
business.  Any regular deviations from these travel policy recommendations 
will be reviewed by each business unit leader.

? Air travel ) Employees are requested to use either Travel Agency in the 
Park (TAP) or the GSS-approved preferred travel agency for your location - 
all of which have access to the significant airfare discounts negotiated by 
GSS - or http://clicktrip.enron.com/enron, the new online travel booking 
service that allows employees to book their own travel with the same 
negotiated discounts.  Employees who fly in the United States should book 
non-refundable coach tickets, which are typically 65 percent less than 
refundable tickets and can usually be changed by simply paying a $100 fee.  
For this reason, we strongly encourage all employees to purchase 
non-refundable domestic coach tickets when possible.

? Lodging ) GSS has also negotiated preferred rates at a number of hotel 
chains in many cities worldwide to accommodate each business unit,s 
individual hotel policy.  We recommend that you use Enron,s list of preferred 
hotels to select accommodations that are in line with your business unit,s 
policies.  You can view the list at http://travel.enron.com.

? Car rental services ) When renting a car for business travel, employees 
should use our preferred car rental agencies ) National (U.S. and Canada) and 
Alamo (U.S.)- since the agreements we have negotiated are intended to protect 
you and Enron through the insurance coverage in our contract.  Visit 
http://travel.enron.com for details and updates to services available outside 
the U.S.

? Off-site meetings ) All domestic-U.S. off-site meetings and events with 
more than 10 people should be coordinated through GSS, which will negotiate 
preferred rates for Enron.  They can be reached at (713) 646-8311.

Because there are differences between business units and offices, each 
business unit leader will follow up this memo with a communication further 
elaborating on these policies as they apply to their business unit.

Each of us has a responsibility to make sure we do our part to ensure Enron 
retains its competitive edge.  These recommendations are some basic, sensible 
actions we can take company-wide, but it is up to every employee to look for 
cost saving measures and do what makes sense in your daily activities.  If 
you have an idea or a suggestion you would like to share with us, please 
e-mail us at recommendationsforcostsavings@enron.com.   A list of questions 
and answers about these policies is posted on 
http://ibuyit.enron.com/gss/ibuyit/csfaq.doc.  If you have additional 
questions, Policy Committee member Kevin Hannon will host an eSpeak on

Their questions primarily 
focused on the business aspects of EOL (for example, how the different 
business units of trading and accounting/back office interface with the 
software and engineering aspects of EOL).  The attorney had two outstanding 
questions:

1.  What regulations govern EOL or the trades done on EOL?
2.  What types of internal controls are in place with regard to risk 
management of Enron's gas and power trading.  For example, what is the 
ability of Enron to take a position that could potentially affect the 
industry as a whole?

We plan to coordinate a possible call to the FERC attorney by regarding the 
regulation question.  In addition, Steve Kean plans to coordinate a call to 
the attorney with Rick Buy (or other appropriate risk management personnel.)"

You and I met at your office last summer to discuss Aprimo's Marketing 
Management Solution. At the time, you indicated that there would be other 
people at Enron that I should speak with. My assigned territory changed 
shortly after our meeting, and I did not follow-up on these contacts. I am 
once again responsible for Enron, and would appreciate your direction to the 
appropriate individuals at Enron.

Our web-based solution has been adopted by over 60 leading companies over the 
past 18 months. They are seeing rapid value from Aprimo's unique ability to 
help them Grow Top-Line Revenue (more effective Marketing) and Reduce 
Bottom-line Cost (more efficient Marketing). With the opportunities facing 
Enron, I'm certain that maximizing your Marketing Investments is of interest 
to the Executive Team and your Shareholders.

Our solution is delivering improvements across all Marketing Functions, such 
as: 

- Event Management 
- Marcom 
- Marketing Financial Management 
- Strategic Planning 
- Direct Marketing 
- Web Response 
- Lead Management 

Leading Analysts have identified Aprimo as the clear leader in Enterprise 
Marketing Management. I would like to arrange brief discovery meetings with 
some of the individuals responsible for Marketing's contribution to Enron's 
growth.

I would appreciate any direction that you and Liz can provide.

For the next 30-45 days, I will be dealing with many integration, logistical 
and new strategy issues.  During that time, I will provide you with a weekly 
update email as to our activities.  Once I have our new strategy mostly 
baked, I will schedule a meeting to get your collective views and feedback.  
I expect that will be at the end of July.  After that, I hope to have regular 
monthly meetings with you

Meanwhile, here is what is happening:

? Personnel - Top priority was to immediately address personnel issues.  My 
target is to reduce the 54 people associated with this effort to an ideal 
structure of 28.  I concluded a week long interview and review process to 
select VP's/Directors/Managers.  The result was the following: 
 New Group
 MD -  Gene Humphrey will remain during a transition period (3 months) and 
will then retire (this was consistent with his own goals).
 VP -  Patrick Hickey (EBS)
   Barbara Paige (EIP)
   Dick Lydecker (Special Assets - his entire group (10) remains in tact)
   Jempy Neyman (Special Assets)
   Andrew Marsden (EBS - London)
 Director  Steven Sheldon (EBS)
   Kevin Kuykendall (EWS)
   John Godbold (EIP)
   John Enerson (Special Assets)
 Manager Kyle Kettler (EWS)
   Michel Nezi Marvin (EBS)
   Mark Gandy (EBS)
   Patrick Johnson (Special Assets)
   Mark Meier (Special Assets)

 Redeployed
 VP -   Jon Thomsen (EBS)
   Michael Miller (EWS)
 Director  Charlie Vetters (EWS)
 Manager Mic Johns (EIP - Washington D.C.)
   Jennifer Adams (EWS)
   Christain Hackett (EBS - London)
   Andreas Kraemer (EWS)
   Fabricio Soares (EIP)

 Next we are evaluating the Analyst/Associates/Admins.  This will be 
completed by June 19.  This will be decreased from 28 people to 15 people.

? Integration - A detailed integration plan is underway (more in the coming 
weeks).  This will begin with a full day offsite on June 20th.  You are 
welcome to attend.

? New Strategy - We are working towards a new strategy and charter.

? Funding sources - Patrick Hickey is working with Shirley Hudler, Michael 
Kopper and others to restructure part of JEDI II, in order to optomize that 
vehicle for our investment needs.  This will hopefully take shape in the next 
30 days.

RAC's view is that exposure under such a guaranty would not be materially 
different from exposure under a direct indemnity provided by ENA if ENA were 
the actual legal entity selling Southwest Power LLC.  RAC supports the

Executive Summary 

? US: Fed,s beige book reports cool results across the U.S.  Lack of 
inflationary pressures gives Fed wider maneuverability to cut rates at end of 
the month.  One Fed member says the economy is probably at or near the 
bottom.  Leader of a U.S. manufacturing organization (N.A.M.) says dollar 
overvalued as much as 30 percent. 
? Europe: ECB trims its forecasts for GDP growth and lifts its inflation 
expectations. Euro continues to languish although it received a bounce 
following anti-strong dollar comments by the U.S.  N.A.M.  Spain urged by the 
OECD to open its power sector to competition.  
? UK: New minister for Europe dampens rumors of an expeditious adoption of 
the euro in the U.K.  
? Country Update - Brazil: Three principal causes for the present energy 
crisis: limited investment, limited private sector participation, and 
regulatory limitations to bringing on new power plants.   Cardoso pledges to 
adhere to existing economic policy platform despite the energy crisis.

a little while.  Feel free to pass this invitation on to other executives in 
your business unit.  The Analysts and Associates tell us that this type of 
exposure to our business leaders helps drive excitement and enthusiasm within

,06/21/2001,,eleader@mail.echampions2000.com,gwhalle@ect.enron.com,,The Momentum of President Bush,"Dear Friends:

On Tuesday night, Republican Randy Forbes was elected to represent one of the 
most competitive, Democratic-leaning districts in America:  Virginia's 4th 
Congressional District.  President Clinton won the 4th district in 1992 and 
1996, and Republican Senate candidates lost the district in 1998 and 2000 
(even while they won statewide).

Despite the tough odds, Randy Forbes won a hard fought election on the 
strength of a positive message of furthering the programs and policies of 
President Bush.  While his Democrat opponent used scare tactics and negative 
campaigning, Forbes won the district by more than 5,000 votes.

The media labeled this election as a referendum on President Bush.  Democrats 
were desperate to win, but Republicans won another victory in a swing 
district.

To give you a bit of historical perspective, there have been 78 special 
elections over the past 25 years.  Only 19 of those special elections 
resulted in a change of party representation for the seat, and only three of 
those 19 swung toward the party of the President.  Historical odds were not 
in his favor, but Representative-elect Forbes defied the odds.

So what does this history-defying Republican victory mean to us on a national 
level?  The Forbes victory is proof positive of the continuing nationwide 
momentum across the political spectrum for President Bush's agenda for 
America.

And you have been a large part of sustaining the Bush momentum.  You helped 
President Bush and Congress achieve together what critics said couldn't be 
done - a bipartisan $1.35 trillion tax relief package.  The first round of 
tax relief checks was mailed yesterday, and I sincerely appreciate your 
helping American taxpayers get the relief we deserve.

If President Bush is to succeed in improving our schools, rebuilding our 
military, saving Social Security and Medicare and ushering in the 
responsibility era, he will need your continued help and involvement.

President Bush is counting on all of us to become his Team Leaders.  Learn 
more about this unique opportunity to spread the President's message and help 
retain and increase our majorities in 2002 by visiting

Again, thank you for your continued efforts.  Without you, odds are we 
wouldn't have been able to win in Virginia.

Very truly yours,

business team on the DA suspension issue.

All intelligence indicates that the CPUC will act on this issue at its June 
28, 2001 meeting (and there are sufficient votes for the decision).
Existing Contracts - It is our recommendation that EES should submit any and 
all DASRs to initiate DA service  to the appropriate Utility no later than 
June 29, 2001 for all customers that have existing contracts if we want to 
ensure DA service.
New Contracts - All new contracts should be signed by both EES and the 
customer no later than June 30, 2001 (July 1, 2001 is a Sunday).  DASRs for 
these contracts should be submitted to the appropriate Utility as soon as 
possible, but in no event later than July 6, 2001.  The July 6 date is our 
estimate of the last date the Utility would accept DASRs for new contracts.  
It is important to note that the CPUC is keeping the clock on contract 
execution timing.
Switching Option - Customers that are on DA service can be returned to the 
Utility per the tariff process.  Once the customer has been returned to 
Utility service after July 1, 2001, our expectation is that there will be no 
ability to have this customer receive DA service in a future timeframe.  In 
addition, returning to Utility service may incur a ""re-entry fee"".
Contract Extensions - EES should consider amending all current contracts that 
terminate after July 1, 2001 with a Evergreen Provision that provides for 
Index pricing with 30 day cancellation notice provisions.  These amendments 
should be signed prior to June 30, 2001.  It is possible that the CPUC will 
require marketers to detail the termination dates of their DA customers.  One 
additional thought - EES may consider having the customer assign any Negative 
CTC receivable to EES as compensation for the Evergreen provision (to 
overcome the CPUC language that indicates that the customer is due the 
Negative CTC credit).

We intend to set up a call for 5pm Houston time today to discuss (call-in 
number to follow).

Direct Access, the CPUC is considering a SoCal Edison recommendation to 
suspend further payment of the Negative CTC to marketers.

The Decision would find that the earlier Stipulation does not require SCE to 
make a cash payment in lieu of a bill credit (even though SCE has already 
paid cash in previous periods for the Negative CTC).
The Decision orders SCE to not make cash payments to satisfy the Negative CTC 
credit.
The Decision is unclear as to whether or not this is simply a suspension of 
payment or would be permanent.
The Decision would apply the same findings and rulings to PG&E and SDG&E.

The key issue is that rather than having a cash receivable, EES would now 
have a bill credit receivable.  In addition, because EES re-sourced its 
customers, the Utility account that holds the bill credit is EES, not the 
customer account.  The only method to obtain the economic value of the bill 
credit is to utilize the Utilities' services.  Even if EES physically serves 
the customers going forward, it may not be the same account that has the bill 
credit.  

The outcome of this case would impact our current Complaint, but it is 
unclear exactly how the CPUC would apply this Decision to that case.

We are intending to (a) try to remove this issue from the CPUC Decision, (b) 
trying to clarify the suspension is not meant as a vehicle to deny us 
payment, and (c) trying to determine that the Utilities' tariff would allow 
us to be paid if our account became ""inactive"".

One other option to consider (at least for SCE) would be to contact SCE 
management to work out a bill credit application process to allow EES to 
route the economic value to our DA customers.  

If anyone has any questions, please call me to discuss.

Retail market
can be opened
nationally?
---
Joe Barton thinks
it can and is
about to try
---
Once in 20 years
opportunity seen

How can the retail power market be opened in today's atmosphere?
     Joe Barton has a way and it sounds like it just might work.
     He briefed APPA members winding up the last day of the annual
meeting in Washington.   Barton implored the membership that if they
have any ideas on how to improve energy policy, this is the time to tell
policy makers or him.
     Barton sees a narrow, six-week opportunity as America is about to
revise its energy policy.
     We walked with him to his car after the speech and asked what he
means by a major energy restructuring bill.
     He referred vaguely to legislation that would improve the grid and
foster the functioning of a robust market providing for movement of
power from one place to another.
     He wants a national market with a grid that can handle it ""in an
open access way -- creating all these trading markets where you have
long-term and short-term markets where you balance supply and demand
around the country.
     ""States that have surplus power, through the RTO system can wheel
that power to states that need it.""
     That's the wholesale market, we asked.
     Yes.
     But what about retail?
     He hopes to get into the law a provision to foster aggregation of
buyers.
     How would that work?
     ""AARP,"" Barton said noticing our age, ""could sell you power or Wal-
Mart or McDonalds or the co-ops.  You could buy your power through
them.""
     How would a law provide for aggregation?
     ""It would be in the federal legislation that it would be
permitted,"" he replied.
     But what about Nebraska where there are only munis?
     ""You've got to work through that and see if you get some kind of
grandfather or state opt-out provision.  It's possible that you give
states the right to opt out.  But over time those states will want to
opt in,"" he added.
     ""That'll be a debate we'll have when we get into the bill.  You're
not supposed to ask that tough a question this early in the process,"" he
reminded with a smile.
     Barton is really impressed with the magnitude of the legislation
gestating in the nation's capital.
     ""Everything"" is up for discussion, he said, ""everything.
     ""There is nothing -- nothing -- that's been debated or talked about
in terms of electricity that is not on the table,"" Barton assured.
     ""I'm not saying we're going to do it all but you have a window like
this once every 20 to 30 years.  I'm going to be damned if I'm going to
stand around and on my on volition take things off the table.
     ""Now the process will automatically take a lot more controversial
items out of play.  There'll be a region or a political block -- who
knows the president might not like something.  John Dingell might not
like something.  Who knows?  But I'm not -- even before we put pen to
paper to start drafting the bill -- say `we're not going to consider
this',"" Barton added.
     Is he getting signals from Dingell that he might be cooperative?
     ""Yeah.  Very cooperative.  Of course, again, the proof is in the
pudding and in the details.""
     Barton's in the leadership role in fostering a national energy
policy, taking the package from the vice president and guiding it
through the House.
     He's the president's energy guy from an energy state and Bush has
shown -- with the tax bill -- that he can get a program enacted.
     Barton wants something he can look back at in five, 10 and 20 years
and say ""that's a good bill.  It works.""
     Barton wants to make history with the Energy Policy Act of 2001.
     Barton told APPA he wants this big bill to be ""national, long-term
in its impact and balanced.""
     Balanced means looking at the generation component, transmission
and distribution ""and in each of those areas -- this is just me.  I'm
not speaking for anyone but myself"" -- he wants ""to create an
environment so we have a maximum, competitive situation that's open and
fair to everybody.
     ""And we're going to do that and you're going to have a lot of
competition, a lot of flexibility with a lot of choice for consumers and
a lot of choice for yourself,"" Barton added.
     Wait a minute.
     He's saying competition in transmission and distribution.
     We really do need to ask him what he has in mind there when the
time is right.
     We can't help but think of competition in selling pipeline capacity
in a secondary market.
     You can do that with electricity capacity to or on a local
distribution system in gas.  We're thinking aloud here.  That's not what
Barton said.
     He wants to minimize the federal role except where you actually
have to.
     That puts Barton ""a little at variance with some in the Bush
Administration and some in the Congress because in the modern age
there's a natural proclivity to centralize and consolidate which in the
political arena means let Washington do it.""
     Barton wants to maximize the technology component and will put into
the bill a distributed generation component.
     He's interested in negawatts, fostering cut backs in demand on a
national scale.
     ""Looking out for your own interest,"" Barton considers to be
""democracy.""
     But from time to time you have to step back and look at the
national interest, he advocated.
     ""That's my job.""
     Today's crisis mentality helps Congress act boldly.
     The friendliness to competitive markets in the White House
encouraged by the president's pride about the retail bill he got through
the Texas Legislature plus today's environment may be ideal for market-
minded leaders.

groups rather than business units - they used to be the same. Unfortunately, 
where we have become more sophisticated and, as in this case legitimately 
hedge a natural exposure with some other commodity, the latter commodity (and 
associated P&L) gets counted in the commodity ""cut"".

Loss notifications, especially, serve as a ""flag"", and provided the 
explanation makes sense and everyone who needs to make a decision about it, 
can do so, then it serves its purpose. The other upside is that when, 
sometime in the future, we have to refer back to an event, we have good 
""institutional memory"".

I talked to Brent about this yesterday - my advice was that notifications 
would be better drafted by those closest to the positions (i.e. his mid

But while group buying has a ""group hug"" effect on shoppers, the practice is

Dec 04, 2000 10:12 AM ET 
	HOUSTON, Dec. 4 (LocalBusiness.com) -- CheMatch.com said more than 95,000 
metric tons of chemicals were traded in November through its private auction 
system -- a volume equal to more than half of the total trades since the 
auction's inception last summer. 
	In a written statement, Ed Moody, CheMatch.com's vice president of auctions 
said the private auction system uses real-time pricing feedback and can be 
tailored to the needs of each user. 
	Since CheMatch.com started the private auctions, about 50 companies have 
traded more than 175,000 metric tons of products including chemicals, 
polymers and fuel products. The average value of completed transactions is 
about $800,000. 
	In addition to auctions, CheMatch.com also operates a commodity chemicals, 
polymers and fuel products exchange on which more than 1 million metric tons 
of product has been transacted. 
	CheMatch has recently completed a restructuring that included layoffs, and 
early last month it withdrew a planned initial public offering. 
	Clay Jeansonne, CheMatch.com spokesman, told LocalBusiness.com last week the 
company currently has 85 employees down from 93 and that CheMatch expects to 
bring in new funding from venture capital and technology companies by the end 
of the year. 
	Privately held CheMatch.com is an Internet-based marketplace for the buyers 
and sellers of bulk commodity chemicals, plastics and fuel products. Its 
investors currently include Battery Ventures, Bayer AG (NYSE: BAYZY),

Iridium satellites may go down in flames 
Iridium, a U.S. satellite telephone company operating under bankruptcy 
protection, is on the verge of one
   of the most spectacular business flameouts ever--literally set to burn up 
billions of dollars' worth of
 Earth-orbiting assets.  Barring the last-minute arrival of a qualified 
buyer, the company plans to begin
 ""de-orbiting"" the 66 satellites that make up the world's first low-orbit 
system for wireless telephone service.  
 That means the first global satellite telephone network--variously reported 
to have cost $5 billion to $7
billion--would be vaporized as its satellites, bumped by their thrusters, 
plunge from 485 miles (781 km)
 above the Earth to burn up over the ocean.

E-commerce firms hip to B2B before it was hot 
   Business-to-business e-commerce is all the rage these days, but a few 
consumer e-commerce companies such as eBay
   entered the market before it was hot.   The leading auction house opened a 
small-business exchange today
 where companies can buy everything from computer printers to nail guns. But 
the move is more of a change in marketing
 than a sudden shift in focus, analysts say.  Business trades have been 
quietly happening on eBay for some time, and its
 format inspired many of the exchanges that have cropped up, such as 
AutoExchange and Chemdex.

In some cases, they're taking the idea a step further, setting up virtual 
markets that
collect fees for all of the goods traded, creating what they hope are highly 
valued companies in the process.
Agricultural giant Cargill was the latest to join the trend, creating a 
market for the $300 billion food industry this week. The Big

   launch on-line marketplace

   PURCHASE, N.Y., ATLANTA, and FEDERAL WAY, Wash., March
   23, 2000 (PRNewswire) - International Paper, Georgia-Pacific
   Corp. and Weyerhaeuser Co. today jointly announced that they
   intend to develop a global business-to-business marketplace to
   enable buying and selling of paper and forest products on-line.

   The companies will take a leadership role to facilitate the utilization
   of Internet technology to enhance service to customers and
   increase efficiency with suppliers. The electronic marketplace will
   create a foundation for common industry standards to simplify and
   accelerate the adoption of electronic commerce across the
   industry.

   The marketplace will operate as an independent entity with its own
   board of directors and management team. Initially, the three
   founding companies will each have an equal equity position, but it is
   expected that more partners will join the initiative. Based on
   demonstrated success, the companies will consider taking the
   entity public.

   The paper and forest products industry in the United States ships
   more than $200 billion worth of products annually. By working
   together to establish an electronic marketplace, the three leading
   companies in the industry believe they can benefit customers by
   simplifying transaction processes, improving information flow and
   increasing speed of delivery, thereby reducing costs. Providing
   both procurement and sales functions means the on-line
   marketplace will also enable participating companies to streamline
   purchasing operations, reduce inventories, cut internal costs and
   increase capital efficiency in the industry.

   The three companies immediately will begin conducting a search
   for a chief executive officer for the new operation and are assessing
   potential technology partners to add state-of-the-art expertise to the
   enterprise. The companies plan to promptly complete a definitive
   agreement, finalize a business plan and enlist additional strategic
   partners, including forest products companies and affiliated industry
   firms.

   John T. Dillon, International Paper's chairman and chief executive
   officer, said, ""This is a substantial commitment on the part of three
   industry leaders to develop a comprehensive electronic
   marketplace for the forest and paper sector. As manufacturers,
   marketers and distributors of a broad array of products, we will
   collectively bring expertise and resources to this effort.""

   A.D. ""Pete"" Correll, Georgia-Pacific's chairman and chief executive
   officer, said, ""This is a bold move for the paper and forest products
   industry. It is a defining step in our industry's positioning in the
   electronic business-to-business marketplace. Our companies
   immediately bring products and distribution capability through our
   active, joint participation."" 

   Steven R. Rogel, Weyerhaeuser's chairman, president and chief
   executive, said, ""Rapidly evolving technology is dramatically
   changing the global marketplace. This initiative will aggressively
   shape the electronic marketplace in the paper and forest products
   industry to ensure our industry meets the current and future needs of
   our customers. It will also promote better relationships with other
   trade partners, such as suppliers."" 

   Executives representing the three companies who will serve as a
   steering committee include Marianne M. Parrs, executive vice
   president, International Paper; and John N. Balboni, vice president -
   e-business, International Paper; David J. Paterson, vice president -
   electronic commerce, Georgia-Pacific; and Robert A. Renner,
   director - electronic commerce, Georgia-Pacific; and Mack L.
   Hogans, senior vice president - corporate affairs with acting
   responsibility for electronic business, Weyerhaeuser; and Darien E.
   Roseen, vice president, strategic planning, Weyerhaeuser. Morgan

  PORTSMOUTH, N.H.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--March 23, 2000--


  Thomas H. Lee Company, Sapient, Bowstreet and others bring financial,
marketing and B2B Internet savvy to Web-based wholesale
  energy exchange


  Taking another step toward becoming the Internet-based energy trading
leader, HoustonStreet Exchange today announced a new round of investments and
strategic relationships with key experts. Thomas H. Lee Company, Sapient and
Bowstreet have all joined HoustonStreet's web for the Web, a virtual network
of business and technology companies that support HoustonStreet's delivery of
wholesale energy trading platforms.

  HoustonStreet established the web for the Web business model as a
rapid-development network of strategic partnerships with companies that have
expertise in disparate fields, rather than building its own departments
in-house. Leveraging the core competencies of its key partners, HoustonStreet
is able to execute quickly and effectively in a rapidly changing environment.
After helping HoustonStreet launch its company and its wholesale power trading
exchange, HoustonStreet.com, these businesses are now helping the company
improve the exchange and expand it aggressively into additional markets.

  Thomas H. Lee Company, one of the oldest, largest and most successful
private equity investment firms in the country with more than $6 billion in
total capital under management, will provide HoustonStreet with important
financial advisement and significant contacts to help the company expand.

  ""HoustonStreet has a great Internet exchange platform and stands alone in
its ability to give energy traders the information they need within an
easy-to-use, fluid trading environment,"" said Tom Hagerty, managing director
at Thomas H. Lee Company. ""We believe online energy trading will grow
dramatically in the months and years ahead, and HoustonStreet is well
positioned to seize this opportunity.""

  In addition to Thomas H. Lee Company, leading technology companies Sapient
and Bowstreet, private equity investment firms Omega Advisors, Inc. and
Elliott Associates, L.P., and principals from MicroArts Corporation
participated in this round of financing. Sapient, Bowstreet and MicroArts all
play integral roles in HoustonStreet's Web-driven business model, and will
continue to help the company respond to market demand in Internet time.
HoustonStreet Exchange relied on Sapient's strategic and systems integration
experience to design and build the site. MicroArts developed the user
interface, interactive marketing Web site, and marketing plan for the site's
launch. Bowstreet is working with HoustonStreet.com to develop the platform
for HoustonStreet to provide additional value-added services to its customers
and to link trading information directly to trading companies' mid- and
back-office systems using XML (Extensible Markup Language) technology. This
will allow risk managers to have a real-time view of trading activity.

  ""These relationships demonstrate the strength of our web for the Web,"" said
HoustonStreet president and CEO Frank Getman. ""We pride ourselves on working
with the best and brightest in their particular areas of expertise who share
our commitment to execution and success. Omega, Elliott and Thomas H. Lee
bring financial and Wall Street expertise, while Sapient, Bowstreet and
MicroArts provide us with the technology and marketing savvy that have given
us a leadership position in the market.""

Please confirm your interest and availability to set aside 30 minutes, or so 
Dec 6, 7 or 8, for me in Houston this week.

I am in a final phase of an expat re-assignment or relocation and would like 
to discuss with you:

Enron's pricing, structuring and position-taking capability for South America 
etc.,.. expected to be in place from the year 2000, at least in power in 
Brazil.

Failure/Successes and immediate opportunities in the Enron Brazil and South 
America core (gas, power) and multiple commodity commercial effort(s), 
including e-business/Networks issues.

Finance expertise  - the critical role that functional groups like Enron 
Metals' (Trade and Structure Finance Group) and the Global Markets 
Insurance/Global Risk groups will (need to) play in helping develop critical, 
internal Enron finance, risk assessment and mitigation expertise to support 
the competitiveness and viability of closing commercial transactions in South 
America and elsewhere

My priority to help form and be re-assigned to a ""Bundle Products"" 
Origination business unit  designed to initiate transactions which 
specifically and formally leverage synergies across Enron Business Units - to 
potentially include in Brazil, at least, power, pulp & paper, steel networks, 
crude and products, and insurance/global risk. 

Please find attatched files which detail some of my ideas for developing the 
core gas and power trading and origination efforts and including the Bundled 
Product unit.   The files were appropriately forwarded to Dave/John. 




I have also attatched my CV should you be interested to review my background 
and experience and  mention, as a reminder, that a meeting is critical in 
potentially determining the outcome of my expat re-assignment or re-location 
process,  needed to be concluded this month, Dec 2000.

August 9th is the target date to achieve 100% participation and finalize the 
commitment from our executives and is also the date for the kick-off of the 
company wide drive.  We have a way to go to meet this objective.  Enron,s 
United Way goal for the year is $2.3 million (before the corporate match). 
ENW,s share of this goal is $161,700.  While these are aggressive goals, they 
are very doable, and if everyone contributes their fair share, we can easily 
surpass these goals. 

Along with focusing on meeting our financial goals, I,d like to have 100% 
participation throughout the organization.  This is especially important 
among our executives.  We define ""participation"" as an employee who has 
completed their pledge on-line and made a contribution, no matter what the 
level.
 
With the campaign going on-line with electronic pledging, I,ll need the 
support of you and your campaigners to increase participation levels across 
the ENW organization and reach our financial goals.  Whatever your decision 
regarding the level of your pledge, we need 100% participation from our 
Executives in order to set a good example for the rest of ENW.  Your 
contribution to the United Way will continue to make a difference in our 
community.  When you give, you change a life right here in our community.

Please join me in setting the standard for ENW by giving generously and 
getting your pledges in by August 9th.

I do NOT want to announce this when it happens.  We have been quietly 
avoiding how much activity we have done so far and many people assume that we 
already have done many...an assumption that helps us.  So please do NOT issue

organization.  These are the names of those employees who have not gone 
online to make their pledge.  Please have your Assistant verify this list.  
If they are indeed your employees, I'm asking you to personally call them and 
ask them to go online and make their pledge.  If any of the names listed

I good friend at Sun suggested me to contact  all of you at Enron  in
regard to the direction of my current searching campaign as  I have made
the decision to leave my post as Vice President and General Manager of
Network Associates Latin America and Caribbean. It is of my understanding
that Enron is undergoing a huge  internal transformation to become one of
the leading E-Commerce players worldwide.

Network Associates is the leading and independent provider   of total
security software solutions to monitor and protect telecommunications,
E-Commerce and internet applications worldwide. Since I was given the
mission to start  the region in 1996 I have been instrumental to
increase sales from 2M to 35M US in 4 years. I have been in charge of
supervising and managing over 100 employees across the region and the US
with complete P&L responsibilities.

Previous to join NAI, I worked  for Seagate where I had the
responsibilitity to set up the whole  supply chain in South Florida and
and across the region resulting in a sales increase from 25M to 125M US
in 4 years. With over 20 years of experience selling and transfering
technology internationally I feel proud of my record and accomplishments.


Should any of you be interested in talking to me about any opportunity
within any of your organizations, please do not hesitate to call me at
954-452-0664. Thank you in advance for your positive consideration. Best
regards, Herbert Arturo Molina"

several of EBS management.  He is our top candidate for this role and we are

A few months ago I explored the idea of creating an Airline Transport 
Contract for passenger travel.   I discovered that the Air Transport 
Association has been keeping statistics such as Revenue Passenger Miles 
(RPM), Available Seat Miles (ASM) and theirs yields per industry revenues 
since 1945.  For instance, this Revenue yield per passenger mile index had a 
range of 6.9 cents in 1945 and grew to 8.7 cents in 1979 (the last year of 
regulation) and then jumped to 11.0 cents in 1980 and has slowly marched to 
13.1 cents in 1998.  

I thought perhaps Enron could develop a call option contract on passenger 
travel tickets, which would help reduce the approximate $30 to $40 million 
Enron pays each year in corporate airline travel.   If Enron could 
successfully develop this contract with Continental, we could roll it out to 
other large corporations and airlines.  After corporate acceptance, the ATC 
may then become a widely traded contract.

Attached is a conceptual presentation I put together describing the idea.  I 
have already shown this to Dan Reck and Jean Mrha, who both recommended I 
send it off to you.   Let me know if you have any questions.   Thank you.

Enron would be interested in a high level discussion of the changes occurring 
in electricity generation and management technologies.  Vanguard is an early 
stage VC fund that helped create Ciena and Network Appliance.  Dan is a new 
partner and is looking at the energy market as a new focus for Vanguard.  

He would like to have a brainstorming session with an eye on creating a 
cooperative relationship between Vanguard and Enron for the evaluation and 
development of new companies in the energy arena.

I would appreciate it if you could respond with your interest level so I 
could arrange a time that is convenient for each of you to participate.

		 Subject: Energy investing...brainstorming and perspective sharing between 
Vanguard Ventures and Enron...

Many thanks for meeting with Bob and I last week.
How ironic to find you working with one of my 
graduate school classmates, Gene Humphrey.

As we discussed, Vanguard is interested in exploring
what kinds of opportunities may exist for venture 
investment in the energy arena.  We think that
the ultimate ""internet (and everything) infrastructure"" play is about clean,
always on, electrical power.  While we are not experts in the area,
and are not yet certain it will be a productive area for venture
capital investment of the type Vanguard does, we feel 
that there is a sufficient market need in multiple segments that 
there MAY be such an investment opportunity which it
would make sense for us to pursue as an investment
focus area.  This could have value for Enron should
we determine investment areas which are symbiotic
with Enron and which we could collaborate on, as we
help catalyze/create/fund exciting new companies.

As we discussed we would love to participate in a brainstorming and 
perspective setting session with visionary and strategic Enron executives
who
have domain knowledge and an interest. Our potential interest areas span 
from generation (alternatives, distributed, and conventional) 
to transmission to distribution to storage...fixed and mobile.  
We appreciate your offer to pull together an Enron group for such 
a brainstorming...and I would be quite happy to fly down to 
Houston again in order to engage in such a session.

As always we appreciate your interest in Vanguard.

the metals business into Enron, I reported that we were aiming to complete 
the integration by the end of the year. I am pleased to report that we are 
well on the way to meeting this target.  

September was a busy month for the metals business as it brought with it both 
the co-location of the London and Tokyo-based metals staff with Enron,s 
offices and the first quarter of combined reporting under Enron Europe.  
Ensuring a smooth transition for both the metals staff and the metals systems 
into our London headquarters took a tremendous amount of co-ordination by 
teams across the company on the part of the former MG team and the 
integration team at Enron Europe.  Nevertheless, &D-Day8 arrived with minimal 
problems and the metals team open for business as usual on the morning of 
September 18th.  

Another key initiative that commenced during September was the re-positioning 
of the MG worldwide metals business as Enron Metals. With the exception of 
the Henry Bath & Son Limited warehousing division, which will remain as 
currently named, the re-branding initiative was kicked off in the UK and 
followed by Japan and the US.  The re-branding initiative is on going with 
all other remaining regions set to undergo completion of the name change by 
the end of November.

Enron Metals is represented throughout the world.  I have attached a regional 
office summary that depicts Enron Metals, locations (Appendix I).

In light of the progress that has been made since the summer, I thought it 
would be helpful to provide you with a brief recap of Enron Metals, core 
business areas and identify those members of the metals team who will be 
leading commercial efforts moving forward. 

Merchanting Division

The Merchanting Division, led by Michael Farmer (+44 (0)20 7783 2049), is a 
worldwide copper merchant, one of the top three independent merchants of 
copper concentrates and nickel and the leading European merchant of recycled 
non-ferrous metals.  Core activities of the merchanting division are: 

? Merchanting of Non-ferrous Metals ) Enron Metals trades as a principal with 
producers and consumers, buying and selling non-ferrous metals and 
concentrates (particularly copper, aluminum and nickel), exchanging qualities 
and locations and lending and borrowing metals.
? Global Stockholding ) Through its affiliate, Henry Bath & Son Limited, 
Enron Metals holds stocks of non-ferrous metals at warehouses around the 
world.
? Merchanting of Recycled Metal ) Enron Metals trades as a principal with 
suppliers and consumers of non-ferrous metal for recycling.  Enron has 
augmented its European recycling platform through the acquisition of assets 
of W&O Bergmann, the leading German Recycling Business.  

Financial Services Division

The Financial Services Division, led by Michael Hutchinson (+44 (0)20 7783 
2079), provides market-making and trading services to Enron Metal,s physical 
metals trading business through futures trading as a member of the London 
Metal Exchange and as a member of COMEX in New York.  The Financial Services 
Division will continue to be comprised of brokerage activities for LME and 
COMEX contracts and be a market-maker for both futures and options contracts 
on the LME and COMEX and in OTC metals contracts. 

With much of the metals business moving to online trading, significant effort 
has been put into getting metals contracts incorporated into EnronOnline,s 
portfolio of product offerings since the metals business, integration into 
Enron this summer.  Today on EnronOnline we are trading six metals (Copper, 
Aluminium, Nickel, Zinc, Lead and Tin) with over 150 products available.

Enron Metals now has almost 800 financial counterparties on the books, with 
300 of these having EnronOnline accounts.  Trading volumes have increased 
from a couple of trades per day in September to a high of 300 in October. The 
attached charts depict the established metals results compared to the start 
up of US natgas (Appendix II).

Origination

Enron Metals established a London-based commercial unit under the direction 
of Eric Gadd, Vice President-Global Metals Origination which is focused on 
completing highly structured and long-dated transactions.  It will integrate 
with existing merchanting and financial service competencies to lever up 
earnings creation.  Currently, the origination team is working on a number of 
Q4 transactions in Australia and the Americas.  The deal pipeline for Q2 has 
prospects in not only these regions but also Europe/Africa and the Middle/Far 
East.   Close and regular communication between the metal origination team 
and other business units inside Enron is essential if we are to succeed in 
building a new capability to achieve earnings targets and deliver shareholder 
value through Enron Metals.  Your active involvement and close co-operation 
here is appreciated.

Warehousing (Henry Bath & Son Limited)  

The Warehousing operations, led by Ed Dablin, operate under the name of Henry 
Bath & Son Limited.  Henry Bath has been in business for more than 200 years 
and maintains a global operation for the physical handling and storage of 
non-ferrous metals, including zinc, tin, copper, nickel, lead and aluminum.  
Henry Bath provides support to both the Merchanting and Financial Services 
Divisions, and also engages in independent warehousing operations.  Its core 
activities include worldwide storage of metals and other products such as 
cocoa, general goods and worldwide shipping services. 

Presently, Henry Bath maintains over three million square feet of storage 
worldwide (most of which is leased), with the largest facilities located in 
the United Kingdom (Liverpool, London, Bristol, Immingham), the Netherlands 
(Rotterdam), Spain (Bilbao, Barcelona), Singapore, and the United States (New 
Haven, New Orleans and Los Angeles).

Rob Soeldner is managing the integration efforts for me.   Please feel free 
to contact him at +44 (0)20 7783 7169 with any questions regarding the 
business.

NEW YORK, Nov 10 (Reuters) - The New York Mercantile Exchange needs a Web 
partner to ensure it capitalizes on its assets and becomes competitive in the 
Internet era of electronic futures trade, former NYMEX chairman Michel Marks 
said.  NYMEX, the world's largest physical commodity exchange, is due to 
launch enymex, its e-commerce venture for trading and clearing standardized 
physical commodity contracts, in early 2001.  But this solo approach may not 
be the most expedient path, Marks said in an exclusive interview at his Red 
Bank, New Jersey. residence.  ""NYMEX has a lot of assets,"" Marks told 
Reuters. ""They have risk capital from the floor, systems, staffing, clearing, 
a brand name. In my opinion, they need to partner through a transition 
phase.""  The challenge for the NYMEX, as for any exchange, is to re-engineer 
itself in the face of vested interests and an ingrained tradition of open 
outcry trading.  ""It takes leadership and a vision to re-engineer those 
assets,"" Marks said.  Futures in crude oil, natural gas, electricity, 
propane, gold, silver platinum, palladium, copper and aluminum are traded at 
the exchange's NYMEX and COMEX divisions.  With the many seats he owns, Marks 
still has a significant vested interest in the health and future of the 
exchanges and in ensuring they do not become obsolete as electronic trading 
transforms the global marketplace.  ""What's the difference between AT&T and 
NYMEX? Xerox?"" he asked. ""All these businesses are sunset industries.""  
Although Marks retired from the floor in 1987, he leases out his and his 
family's many seats and closely follows the industry. After leaving the 
floor, he eventually started what he called a ""pre-Internet venture.""  ""It 
was a Web site for the futures industry,"" he said. ""I spent three years in it 
and I realized that no one would ever, ever make any money at it.""  Like all 
successful traders, Marks took his losses and got out quickly.  ""I understand 
the electronic world and the pit,"" he said.

After becoming acting chairman in late 1977 at age 28 in what he called ""a 
quirk of fate"" when the chairman at the time had a heart attack, Marks 
relaunched NYMEX's heating oil and residual oil contracts with a New York 
harbor delivery and made over the management of the exchange, turning it into 
a very successful, global marketplace.  Recently he has been researching the 
various front-end systems that were created by companies like Trading 
Technologies and are at the cutting edge of electronic trade.  ""Business is 
moving to EnronOnline, HoustonStreet and ICE, and there are another 
dozen-plus energy-only electronic exchanges out there already,"" said Marks, 
referring to the host of business-to-business (B2B) exchanges to trade power, 
crude oil and natural gas.

The Intercontinental Exchange, or ICE, started live Internet trading of 
energy products on Oct 12. The Atlanta-based exchange is a partnership of 
seven major banks and oil companies.  EnronOnline was established last 
November by Houston-based Enron , North America's biggest buyer and 
seller of natural gas and electricity.  HoustonStreetExchange of Portsmouth, 
New Hampshire, is the first fully web-based trading portal and a 
majority-owned subsidiary of BayCorp Holdings, Ltd. .

Marks said the market will make a pragmatic choice about whether to move to 
electronic exchanges, continue to trade open outcry, or a use a side-by-side 
combination based on how easily business can get done.  ""The fact of the 
matter is, the most important thing is liquidity,"" he said. ""Performance 
counts.""

Dear Sir or Madam :

 Enron Corp. (&Enron8) believes in conducting its business affairs in 
accordance with the highest ethical standards.  Accordingly, employees of 
Enron and its subsidiaries are required to comply with Enron's Business 
Ethics Policy which requires an employee to conduct himself/herself in a

not bring to the employee financial gain separately derived as a direct 
consequence of his/her employment with Enron.  Further, Enron's Business 
Ethics Policy states that no lavish entertainment or gifts are to be given or 
received by Enron employees for special position, price, or privilege.

 Not only is it incumbent upon our employees to follow this policy, but your 
cooperation in respecting these standards is also critical.  Enron expects 
each of its vendors and contractors to maintain adequate records that 
document its work relationship with Enron.  Enron's auditing department will 
routinely conduct business ethics compliance audits of certain vendors and 
contractors with whom Enron does business.  Your recognition of our ethical 
standards allows Enron employees to work with you via arm's length

College football season is winding down, which means a busy month for
Executive Vice President/General Manager Charley Casserly and the Texans'
scouting staff.

Casserly visited Texas A&M and the University of Miami this week before
returning to Houston Friday for facility and scouting meetings. He plans to
attend tomorrow's game between top-ranked Oklahoma and the 24th-ranked
Aggies in College Station. Next week, Casserly will continue his Big 12 tour
with a venture to Nebraska.

Leonard Shapiro of The Washington Post featured Casserly and the Texans in
his weekly NFL notes. Click here to read the story:
http://washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/sports/leaguesandsports/nfl/A31203-2000Nov7
.html

Casserly will join Texans Owner Bob McNair in Austin Monday for a reception
at the home of Austin resident Lowell Lebermann.

""We're looking to extend our fan base all over southeast Texas and Austin is
a vital part of our push,"" Casserly says. ""Football is a very important part
of the Austin community. We can offer their fans the best stadium in this
country, a new beginning and a team that they can grow with.""

McNair is coming off a successful weekend at the Breeders' Cup in
Louisville. His filly Tout Charmant took second in the Filly & Mare Race
last Saturday. Tout Charmant can now boast six wins and nine second-place
finishes in 21 career starts. Next year's Breeders' Cup Championships will
be at Belmont Park.


More than 400 women attended the Houston Texans' first Football 101 Workshop
for Women this past Saturday at Foley's in downtown Houston.

The event was hosted by KTRK/ABC-13's Debra Duncan and KIKK 95.7 FM's Lisa
Dent. In a workshop setting, the group learned about life in the NFL, the
history of football, strategy, equipment and officials' signals. Texans
Executive Vice President/General Manager Charley Casserly was the featured
speaker, joined by Hall of Fame safety Ken Houston, former Oilers wide
receiver Haywood Jeffires, Texans Director of Pro Scouting Chuck Banker,
Associate Director of Pro Scouting Bobby Grier, Associate Director of Pro
Scouting Miller McCalmon and former NFL referee Red Cashion.

KTRK taped the event and will air a half-hour Debra Duncan Show devoted to
Football 101 Saturday, Dec. 23, at 6:30 p.m."

the e-mails below outline my ideas for an improved commercial effort in the 
South American region, including the offer to discuss (as objectively as 
possible) a critical review of our managerial, execution and employee 
strengths and weaknesses in the region. 

I am trying to schedule meetings in Houston during the week of Nov 20 in 
order to finalize in the recent transition and restructuring a position 
remaining with Enron - but including a priority to remain in Brazil, given 
it's enormous and, at least for Enron, as yet largely unrealized potential.  

I've isolated business units in Bundled Products and Networks, separately 
from core Origination and Trading, in the Org Chart graphics below and 
propose that my capabilities and interest might be best leveraged with clear 
deliverables and responsibility for these units.   

You and I didn't have the chance to discuss commercial opportunities in the 
region more completely, but the Bundled Products and Networks units might 
better be combined, given that there are several transactions that would 
easily include bundling potential Enron Networks ""products"" (e-platforms, EOL 
(commitment of physical product in exchange for EOL marketing, etc.,..)  into 
a transaction.

Appreciate any, all inputs and look forward to further discussion."

  11/14/2000 

NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--November 14, 2000-- Kiodex Inc., a provider of 
technology-based trading and risk-management solutions for the commodities 
markets, recently added two new members to its senior management team: Raj 
Vaswani, Vice President and General Counsel and Thomas Farley, Chief 
Financial Officer. Mr. Vaswani will develop and manage the company's legal 
and regulatory strategies. Mr. Farley will manage the company's finance and 
accounting functions. 

""Having worked with countless high-flying technology companies, Kiodex 
impresses me as being the cream of the crop,"" said Vaswani. "" Kiodex is 
without peer in its vision to deliver risk management and trading services to 
the marketplace.""

Raj Vaswani comes to Kiodex from Morrison & Foerster LLP in New York, one of 
the leading new-media law firms, where he was an attorney in the Technology 
Transactions Group and specialized in corporate and intellectual property 
transactions for high-technology companies, including public equity 
offerings, mergers and acquisitions, and software-development transactions. 
Recently profiled in the New York Law Journal, Mr. Vaswani is a well-regarded 
attorney in the field of new media and has authored numerous articles 
regarding the legal aspects of emerging high-technology businesses. 

Thomas Farley joins Kiodex from Gryphon Investors, an investment firm 
specializing in leveraged acquisitions of and growth equity investments in 
high-growth, middle-market companies. Mr. Farley found and evaluated 
acquisition candidates, executed transactions, monitored investment 
portfolios, and directly supplemented the management of several portfolio 
companies. Previously, Mr. Farley worked for Montgomery Securities (now Banc 
of America Securities) where he was a corporate finance investment banker 
advising high-growth middle- and large-market companies. 

"" Kiodex compares favorably to the many early-stage technology companies that 
I worked with previously,"" noted Farley. ""The company's position as a 
nuts-and-bolts technology provider with a proprietary solution and a superb 
management team made my decision to join the company an easy one."" 
""We are thrilled at these two new additions to our management team at Kiodex 
. Their decision to join us marks our transition to a new stage of growth,"" 
stated R. Martin Chavez, CEO. ""The high-tech expertise Mr. Vaswani gained 
while at Morrison & Foerster makes him the ideal leader of our legal and 
regulatory strategies; moreover, Raj has been with us as outside counsel 
since the inception of Kiodex . Tom, with his hands-on experience at 
Gryphon's portfolio companies, will plan our path to profitability and embed 
planning, budgeting, and forecasting into our DNA at Kiodex ."""

This transition of services, as presently managed by Enron Property and

In rough outline I described a trading activity  where the activity would 
include 2-3 million tons per annum of ammonia with  similar volumes in each 
of the other primary items handled which would include  phosphate 
rock,sulfuric acid,DAP,urea,urea ammonium nitrate solutions,and  sulfur. In 
the course of our discussion it was correctly noted that the scope of  the 
base trading income anticipated would fall in the range of $50-$70million  
per annum and? that was short of the mark you would like to see in your  
evaluation.?
I would comment that there will be better years but  to average much above 
these objectives will be unlikely in these markets as they  exist today.
To find more on a consistent basis we would need to  anticipate investments 
in bricks and mortar.?There will be many  opportunities (terminals, shipping, 
handling, production) where we will find a  IRR over 20 with an exit strategy 
of less than five years. These are  opportunities above and beyond the base 
trading income anticipated.

(R-IN) in Dallas on Sunday, November 19th.   Jeff is going to be out of town, 
so I wanted to know if you are interested in attending on Enron's behalf?  
I'm told it's going to be a small gathering of CEOs from Texas companies.   
Senator Lugar is the Chairman of the Senate Ag Committee, which has primary 
jurisdiction over the Commodities Exchange Act legislation.   Lugar is a 
senior player on ag issues, and will be very influential in the farm policy 
debate -- which begins anew next year.    He's also involved in foreign 
relations issues, and is pro-trade.

Let me know if you're interested (and available) to attend this event, and I 
will get additional details to you asap.

shown in the FRS.  The team would be happy to show you a demo at your 
convenience, perhaps early next week.  We anticipate our back office using 
FIX in parallel with existing systems for December 2000, and then using FIX 
""under fire"" for January 2001 invoices.

The demo uses actual data from Sempra, our largest volume natgas financial 
counterparty.  In about a minute, FIX is able to compare Enron data and 
Sempra data (received electronically as an excel spreadsheet and stored on a 
mini version of our Deal Database), immediately matching about 1450 of the 
1500 deals.  It then helps the user to manually match those 50 deals that the 
primary match engine could not.  This whole process, if it were purely 
manual, would take more than a day.  Using excel spreadsheets (and sort 
functions), Enron currently spends 4 to 8 hours per month matching Sempra 
invoices. FIX allows the user to perform all matching in about 10 minutes.

Our next deliverable is the Confirm Central module v1.0, due 1 December.  We 
anticipate delivering it on time, as we have with FIX.


All the best,

storage systems, announced that its newest fuel storage system (5000 psi)
would increase the range of fuel cell vehicles by over 30% relative to
current designs.
* California Governor Gray Davis signed a bill in late September
creating incentives for the purchase or lease of new zero emission vehicles
(ZEV).  While the details of the program are to be proposed on December 7th
and 8th in Sacremento, individual grants of up to $9,000 over three years
($3,000 per year) may be offered to consumers, both private and public, who
purchase or lease ZEVs.
* Innogy Technology Ventures received approval from the Tennessee
Valley Authority (TVA) to build a regenerative fuel cell power plant in
Mississippi using the company's Regenesys technology.  A regenerative fuel
cell stores and releases electrical energy through a reversible
electrochemical reaction using two salt electrolytes.

HELPING HANDS
The Texans celebrated the conclusion of their 2000 United Way Campaign at
Pennzoil Place Thursday. And the results were just what Texans Owner Bob
McNair was seeking when he launched the campaign a month ago. All 71 Texans
employees contributed. Seven donated $10,000 or more. McNair and his wife
Janice matched the total contribution of the club, bringing the Texans'
total to $205,000.

""Thank you so much for helping us be a part of your team,"" said Jacqueline
S. Martin, President of the United Way of the Texas Gulf Coast. ""For you to
believe so much in our mission to impact the community is overwhelming. I am
floored with the 100 percent participation. It is absolutely unheard of.""

The McNairs are no stranger to the United Way, but the team gives them a
more visible platform for their charitable work.

""We're delighted with everyone's participation,"" Bob McNair said. ""It was a
tremendous team effort.""

The NFL has worked with the United Way for the past quarter-century, using
its players, coaches and staff to help member cities and their surrounding
communities.

OUT AND ABOUT
Texans Executive Vice President/General Manager Charley Casserly visited the
University of Nebraska earlier this week. He heads to the Meadowlands Sunday
to scout the Giants-Lions game.

REALIGNMENT TALKS
Representatives from 17 NFL teams met in Denver Wednesday for discussions on
realignment for the 2002 season, when the Texans hit the field. The NFL will
expand to eight four-team divisions in 2002, placing the Texans in the AFC.
Houston -- as well as transplanted teams in Baltimore, St. Louis and
Tennessee -- does not have a vote in the realignment proposal.

""Those were preliminary discussions in Denver this week,"" Casserly says.
""There will be a meeting in mid-January just on the realignment issue. The
league has set June as a target date for realignment to be finalized.""

NEW YORK - The IntercontinentalExchange (ICE) said Friday it had traded 150 
million barrels of crude and refined products since the October 12 launch of 
its web-based energy trading platform.

It marks a 110 million barrel rise in cumulative oil volumes since October 26 
for the online venture, backed by some of the world's biggest energy firms 
and offering derivative contracts outside regulated exchanges for energy and 
metals.

ICE said it traded more than 2 million megawatt hours of power on Thursday, 
its highest yet.

The site has traded a total 800 million mmBTUs (million British Thermal 
Units) of natural gas and natural gas derivatives, and 22 million 
megawatt-hours of firm power as of close of trading November 16.

ICE has also traded a total of 15 million gold and gold equivalent ounces 
since precious metals contracts were launched on August 24, the company said 
in a statement.

Some 85 of the world's largest energy and financial commodity firms are 
participating in its contracts, it added. The total notional value for all 
OTC products traded to date on ICE is over $13 billion.

Original partners in the Atlanta-based exchange are BP Amoco Plc , 
Royal/Dutch Shell , TotalFina , Goldman Sachs , Societe Generale ,Morgan 
Stanley Dean Witter and Deutsche Bank .

In July, six further gas and power partners were recruited - American 
Electric Power , Utilicorp's Aquila Energy , Duke Energy , El Paso Energy , 
Reliant Energy and Southern Company Energy Marketing .

There are currently at least 16 other energy trading Web sites on the 
Internet, but traders have said that with the backing of seven major banks

,11/21/2000,,eleader@mail.echampions2000.com,gwhalle@ect.enron.com,,RNC Needs Your Help for Florida Effort,"The votes have been counted.  We won.  Thank you for your support.  The 2000 
election should be over.  But because the Democrats are trying to rewrite the 
rules, the fight continues.  Governor Bush and Secretary Cheney urgently need 
your help.  To contribute immediately, see form below.

The situation in Florida is unprecedented and the dispute may still spread to 
other closely contested states.  We are confident of victory, but we need 
your help.

George W. Bush and Dick Cheney clearly won the majority of legitimately cast 
ballots in Florida and, with Florida's 25 electors, a majority of the 
Electoral College.

All the Democrat maneuvering -- in the courts, in the streets, on television 
-- is designed to confuse the public about that simple fact while throwing 
the election into a rigged process in which partisan Democrat officials can 
count thousands of improper ballots.

We MUST NOT let the Democrats steal this election.  The RNC has sent staff to 
Florida and other battleground states such as Iowa, New Mexico, Oregon and 
Wisconsin as well.  We are fighting a multi-front war, and it is expensive.  
These costs are unexpected and unbudgeted -- and they come at a time when the 
RNC's resources have been depleted by the election.  That's why I'm asking 
for your help again today.

I've included two articles - Charles Krauthammer's November 17 column, and 
excerpts from a Los Angeles Times report -- that describe how the Democrats 
are waging this battle.   I hope you'll take time to read them -- they are 
revealing, and they emphasize how high the stakes are in this contest.

Again, I would ask you to read the articles below - and then do four 
important things for our country:

1) send this e-mail on to your own e-mail list - to all of your friends and 
neighbors who care about this country and want the truth to come out in 
Florida

2) Call, e-mail and write your local elected officials, Democrats and 
Republicans. You can get the addresses, phone numbers and e-mail addresses of 
your elected Congress people and Senators at 
http://www.visi.com/juan/congress/

3) call your local talk radio show or TV news show and let them know your 
strong views on this issue

4) write a letter to the editor of your local, regional or national 
newspapers on this important subject


Al Gore lost on November 7.  He is now seeking to reverse the results of the 
election in court.  This is an outrage -- and it is a sad day for our 
country. We will fight this battle with all the available means at our 
disposal.  Please help as generously as you can. See below how to contribute 
online, or send your contribution to:

Thank you.

Not by Hand
By Charles Krauthammer

     There is a reason that machines have been chosen by Florida and so many 
other states to count ballots. The reason is not only speed and efficiency 
but fairness. Of course machines make mistakes, but the mistakes are 
distributed randomly. There is no premeditation, no search for advantage.
     Undoubtedly there were many presidential ballots that were 
double-punched, under-punched or otherwise spoiled in Florida. But machines 
read such errors with scrupulous impartiality. The same cannot be said of 
hand counting. Hand counting is arbitrary, open to manipulation and abuse.
Mechanical ballots are designed to be read by machines, not humans. When 
humans try, the results, as we have seen in Palm Beach, range from the 
arbitrary to the bizarre. Hence the comic contortions of the ballot examiners 
holding up cards to the light, trying to divine the intent of voters. Hence 
the spectacle of Gore supporters going to court to get a judge to declare 
that ""dimpled chads""--a slight indentation in the piece of paper one is 
supposed to punch through, even slighter than the now legendary ""pregnant 
chad""--must be counted as a vote.
     Second, a manual recount subjects computer cards, literally, to 
manipulation. Under this method, the presidency of the United States hangs by 
a thread, the thread holding the dangling chad. Any waving, shuffling, 
rubbing or other movement can easily cut the thread, dislodge the chad, and 
produce a ""vote.""
     This would be true even if those judging the ballots were perfectly 
neutral. They are not. The counting by hand is in fact counting by Democrats: 
The counties now seeking to conduct these recounts--Palm Beach and 
Broward--are controlled by Democrats. The decision regarding the legality of 
every newfound Gore vote is made by a committee that is either entirely or 
majority Democratic.
     These counties, moreover, are two of the most heavily Democratic in the 
state. They went for Gore with majorities larger than that by which Lyndon 
Johnson won over Barry Goldwater in 1964--and that was the biggest landslide 
of our time. Broward Democrats chose three sample precincts to decide whether 
to recount the entire county: Two of the test districts voted 20 to 1 for 
Gore, the third 50 to 1. Brezhnev never did that well.
     In such heavily Democratic districts, there is no way a recount will not 
produce more net votes for Gore. You simply expand or narrow your criteria 
for voter ""intent""--and produce whatever number you need to win.
What is the fairest way to determine the winner in a state such as Florida? 
The fairest is a statewide machine count--and recount. Why? Because the 
errors balance out.
     What about a statewide manual recount, an option offered by Gore in his 
televised Nov. 15 gambit? It has two disabling liabilities. First, it vastly 
multiplies the opportunity for fraud and bias. Thousands of people in 
thousands of precincts handling millions of cards--cards that can be 
manipulated and altered with ridiculous ease. There just aren't enough 
watchdogs to watch all the partisans.

See the full article at http://www.washingtonpost.com/


SEASONED DEMOCRATIC ARMY HITS THE SHORES OF FLORIDA

Excerpts from The Los Angeles Times:

""To scrounge for every last vote, Gore has flooded Fort Lauderdale with 
tough, seasoned Democrats, the sort who are used to keeping wafflers in line 
and to count and recount votes until they know exactly what it will take to 
outdo their opponents. Many of the hired hands speak with a Boston brogue... 
""Not far away, in an abandoned Payless shoe store, vanloads of  AFL-CIO 
staffers and Gore loyalists from New York, Chicago, Nashville, Philadelphia, 
San Francisco and elsewhere had  disembarked to learn how to observe the 
ballot count.  ""'Our goal,' said one lawyer as he patiently lectured his new 
charges, 'is to preserve the Al Gore vote.'  The volunteers  nodded. 'It's 
very, very important that if you see any kind of mark--a scratch, a dent, a 
pinprick in Al Gore's column--that you challenge.'   When someone then asked 
what they should do if they found a Bush ballot with an indent, the lawyer 
said: 'Keep your lips sealed.'  It was hardball that the Bostonians and other 
importe!

Fortune magazine's September article about your--virtually
overnight--success building EnronOnline prompted me to contact you, mostly
because our company's (Everypath, Inc.) wireless technology could be the
perfect tool to help you move the EnronOnline marketplace into wireless by
offering trading anytime, anywhere, via any wireless devices (as we've done
for E*Trade, Fidelity, and others offering complex wireless transactions).

Very briefly, our company has quickly gained real traction in this space.
We were honored as a Smithsonian Laureate this year, named by Forbes among
the 25 Best of the Web in business to business, and recognized by CNet as
one of ten ""wireless companies to watch.""   Our partners include Sun
Microsystems, Hewlett-Packard, Andersen Consulting and Cap Gemini Ernst &
Young, as well as many others, and have already raised significant funding
from investors such as Robertson Stephens, Comdisco, Dain Rauscher Wessels,
Sevin Rosen, U.S Venture Partners, Andersen Consulting Ventures, Sun, and H
& Q.

If you see commodities trading moving soon into wireless,  just as you saw
(or influenced) the industry to move online, shouldn't Enron lead the way in
wireless trading too?  We would love the opportunity to talk to you about
helping you go wireless.

Let me know if I should follow-up with you or someone else in your group by
sending an email or calling at any of the numbers below.  I look forward to
hearing from you, and to coming home to Houston to speak with you further
about this (I practiced law in Houston for years with Weil, Gotshal &
Manges--over in the NationsBank building on Louisiana).

Citigroup is extending its reach as a provider of financial services to 
business-to-business marketplaces. The $82 billion company has struck a deal 
with Oracle to integrate its payment and financial-settlement services into 
the vendor's online marketplace platform, Oracle Exchange.

In addition, Citigroup will co-brand and market OracleExchange.com, Oracle's 
trading exchange for business supplies, to business clients and deploy 
Oracle's E-procurement applications internally to simplify its own purchasing.

Citigroup already offers its services, called CitiConnect, to rival 
marketplace companies i2 Technologies Inc. and Commerce One Inc. CitiConnect 
supports complex financial transactions, such as employee procurement-card 
purchases, electronic funds transfers, and cross-border payments, for 
businesses participating in exchanges, whether or not they're Citibank 
customers.

Other financial companies target-ing this market include Chase Manhattan Bank 
Corp. and First Union Corp., which have partnerships with online marketplace 
software provider Metiom Inc.; Wachovia Corp. has aligned with Clarus Corp.; 
and ABN Amro, Bank of America, and US Bank have payment-services deals with 
Ariba Inc.

""We see the role of banks in this space increasing as more commerce occurs 
online,"" says Ann Cairns, global E-solutions head at Citigroup's E-business 
unit. ""The key thing that we bring in working with technology companies is an 
understanding and intellectual capital around security and privacy issues.""

But Cairns says few transactions occur on exchanges today. Most are building 
their marketplaces, she says. It may be a while before integrated payment 
services gain traction. A recent survey by AMR Research revealed that 
companies participating in exchanges are still most interested in product and 
vendor search capabilities, order status and tracking, and integration with 
partners.

RetailExchange .com Inc., a business-to-business exchange for excess consumer 
goods, is working on integrated credit services with commercial finance firm 
CIT Group Inc. It plans to add shipping and payment services eventually, but 
says large companies already have departments with expertise in those areas. 
Says Ken Frieze, president and CEO of RetailExchange.com, ""add-on transaction 
services have to be better and have a greater value proposition than what's 
available offline."""

The holiday season can mean an increased risk of fires and a higher potential 
for criminal activity due to people taking advantage of convenient downtown 
shopping and because of the increased number of special events and office 
parties.  We would like to pass along a few safety and security tips from the 
City of Houston Fire Department and the Houston Police Department.

? Please do not prop open stairwell doors or doors to the freight elevators.  
This defeats security. 

? Use only artificial trees and greenery in decorating your office space. Do 
not place cut trees or greenery within the building. Cut trees become major 
fire hazards when they dry out.

? Office parties or the holiday mood may distract you.  Be alert for thieves 
who try to take advantage of the holiday season. Sometimes just having fewer 
people at work during the holidays creates an opening for thieves. If you see 
someone that does not appear to belong in your work area, immediately call 
the Enron Security Console at 713-853-5360.

? Keep your purse or wallet with you at all times or locked away in a drawer 
or closet.

? If you go shopping, invite a friend to go along. Try not to overload 
yourself with packages.  When you return, lock your gifts away in a safe 
place.

? Always be aware of your surroundings while in a public area. If things don,
t look right, follow your instincts and avoid going into the area.

? When waiting for a ride home after hours, remain inside the building near a 
card-reader door until you see your ride arrive. 

? If office parties are on company premises and involve alcoholic beverages 
or public invitees, call security at 713-853-5360.  Security will advise you 
as to company guidelines."

=DJ Enron, Powerex Investigated For Alberta Price Fixing
11/21/0 15:31 (New York)



      By Cheryl Devoe Kim
      Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

  TORONTO (Dow Jones)--Canada's Competition Bureau raided the offices of Enron
Canada Corp. in Calgary and Powerex Corp. in Vancouver earlier this year as
part of an investigation into suspected electricity price fixing by the two
companies, according to documents obtained by Dow Jones Newswires.
  Bureau investigator David Bloom alleges in an application for a warrant he
used to gain access to the offices that in the summer of 1999, Powerex and
Enron were coordinating bid restatements and inflating the price each received
for electricity as they traded on the Power Pool of Alberta.
  The investigation hasn't yet produced any charges against either of the
companies, according to Enron. The Competition Bureau declined to comment on
the status of the case.
  Both Enron Corp. (ENE), which owns Enron Canada, and Powerex, a unit of
provincially owned British Columbia Hydro & Power Authority (X.BCH), deny
breaking any rules or laws.
  From Powerex's point of view, Albertans are looking for someone to blame for
high power prices, which have become a political issue in the province.
  ""They just find it easy to blame us for what are pretty fundamental market
design flaws,"" Powerex president and chief executive Ken Peterson told Dow
Jones Newswires in an interview.
   Deregulation Spurs Search For Someone To Blame
  The search for someone to blame has repeated itself across every 
deregulating
market Enron has participated in, Enron Corp. spokesman Mark Palmer said.
  ""Almost every time that either power markets or natural gas markets or even
oil markets or gasoline markets have experienced any kind of price volatility,
there have been investigations done,"" Palmer said.
  Enron has been scrutinized before as part of wider energy markets
investigations, he said, but never found to be breaking the rules. This is the
first such investigation into Powerex's actions, Peterson said.
  The Competition Bureau, based in Ottawa, won't say whether the investigaion
is ongoing, citing disclosure rules under the Competition Act.
  The companies themselves said they're not sure of the investigation's 
status.
Their seized files were returned several months ago, but Powerex hasn't heard
from the Bureau since then. Enron did receive a call from the Bureau last week
with a question, according to Enron Corp. spokesman Eric Thode.
  The investigation began when the Power Pool of Alberta's system controllers
noticed the clearing price for a megawatt of electricity was topping C$100 
with
unusual frequency.
  The Pool's price is set by participants submitting bids to buy or sell power
for the following day. Until Oct. 19, 1999, a bidder could restate the amount
of power in a bid or offer an unlimited number of times, until 20 minutes
before the hour of transmission. The price paid for every megawatt of power
needed by the Pool in a given hour is set by the most expensive unit needed to
meet demand.
   Alleged Bid Rigging Methods Detailed
  According to the Competition Bureau search warrant application, Powerex and
Enron were rigging their bids in the following manner:
  Powerex would lower the volume of an existing offer. As little as two 
minutes
later, Enron would increase its offer for the same period by the same volume,
but at a ""significantly higher price,"" according to the warrant application.
Sometimes, Enron would increase its offer even before Powerex had dropped its
offer.
  Power Pool market analyst Owen Craig, who once worked in Enron Canada's gas
trading group, found that ""as a result of restatements, involving mostly
Powerex and Enron,"" the Pool price was raised once to C$200/MWh, four times to
between C$354.29 and C$499.93, three times to between C$500 and C$541.63, and
10 times to between C$801.02 and C$998.
  Based on the restatement patterns, Craig, and then the Bureau's Bloom,
concluded that no new energy was being offered to the Pool. They believed the
power was just being transferred from Powerex to Enron and then offered at the
higher price, according to the warrant application. By cutting the volume
offered by Powerex, the more expensive power offered by Enron would likely be
needed, and every participant would get the higher price.
  Powerex's Peterson doesn't take issue with the trade history as detailed by
the Bureau, but denies that the company's traders were doing anything wrong or
that the two companies had some sort of arrangement.
  ""And we're adamant about that,"" Peterson said. ""There was no deal with 
Enron.
There was no expectation about what their behavior would lead to in terms of a
change in prices or anything like that.""
  Powerex traders were merely locking in their price, cutting the company's
risk, which Enron agreed to take on by buying the power at a fixed price,
Peterson said.
  ""Whenever Enron's offer of high-priced energy was declined, within moments 
of
Enron being advised by the Pool that their energy would not be required,
Powerex would restate an identical volume of energy back into its lower priced
unit,"" according to the warrant application.
  Peterson's response: ""We're operating in a very tight market there and we
felt an obligation to make sure the power got delivered into Alberta.""
  Enron also denies it broke any Power Pool rules or Canadian laws.
  ""It boils down to we were offered power at a price lower than we thought we
could sell it at,"" Enron's Thode said. ""And that's what Enron and every other
company does that's in the business of trading.""
  The May 25 search warrant covers the companies' actions between June 1, 
1999,
and Oct. 19, 1999. On Oct. 20, 1999, the Pool changed its restatement rules,
essentially closing the loophole, though it did so without ever making public
its investigation into Powerex and Enron.
  Power Pool spokesman Wayne St. Amour declined to discuss details of the
investigation.
  ""Market surveillance is in place to, among other things, protect the
interests and activities of market participants,"" he said.
  Those convicted under Canadian law for bid-rigging can be fined an amount at
the court's discretion and/or jailed up to five years. A conviction wouldn't
likely affect Powerex's ability to trade in the U.S., Peterson said. In Canada
""there would have to have some follow-on action by the Alberta parties to
inhibit that. And so far, they still like to get our power.""
  Companies Concerned About Reputations
  The bigger problem, Peterson said, is what the case will do to the Powerex
reputation.
  ""Essentially both companies are concerned about it because we have a lot at
stake from a reputational point of view,"" Peterson said. ""Both companies, I
believe, conduct themselves in the highest possible standard. But these are
difficult times in the business with prices going crazy in Alberta and
California and people looking for somebody to blame. There's always a
possibility of collateral damage when politics gets involved.""
  Powerex parent company BC Hydro is also suspected by the Power Pool of
Alberta of unfairly providing access to transmission through British Columbia,
linking Washington with Alberta, as detailed in an Oct. 13 Power Pool market
surveillance report. Again, no charges have been laid.

Dear Echampion,

The situation in Florida is an outrage.  And it is getting worse.  The RNC 
urgently needs your help today.

Over the weekend, Al Gore's campaign has waged an all-out effort to 
disqualify military absentee ballots and almost succeeded in throwing out 
over 1400 in all.  Military absentees were running heavily in favor of 
Governor Bush - so they became a ""shoot-to-kill"" target for win-at-all-costs 
Democrat operatives.

The articles below, one from the Chicago Sun Times and one from the New York 
Post, amply demonstrate this ""Democratic vote scheme.""

The Gore effort to nullify the military vote was statewide.  A leaked five 
page memo from the Gore staff laid out the details -- precise instructions to 
Democrats in every county on how to challenge military ballots on 
technicalities.  And as the ballots were counted in one county, the Chicago 
Sun Times source noted:

""Gore had five attorneys there.  Their sole objective was to disenfranchise 
the military absentee votes. They challenged each and every vote.  Their sole 
intent was to disqualify each and every absentee voter.  They constantly 
challenged military votes that were clearly legitimate, but they were able to 
disqualify them on a technicality.""

Such tactics are shameful.  This has been an exceptionally close election.  
On Election Day, George W. Bush received a majority of the legitimately cast 
and counted ballots in Florida and, with Florida's 25 electors, a majority of 
the Electoral College.

Al Gore is now attempting to reverse the outcome of the election by getting 
Democrat judges to rewrite Florida's election laws after the fact to permit 
partisan Democrat officials to count thousands of improper ballots.  That is 
bad enough -- but to selectively target our men and women in uniform purely 
in order to knock out a few hundred more votes for George Bush is beneath 
contempt.

We URGENTLY need your help today!  Please:

1) Make as generous a contribution as you can to the RNC's Fair Elections 
Fund, by following this link: 
https://www.econtributor.net/Contribution/Contribution.cfm?AID=MFBWXSUVZGCH

(If you want to contribute by check, you can print out a donor form through 
this link:
http://www.rncfc.org/econtributor/mailcheck2.htm)

2) Call, e-mail and write your local elected officials, Democrats and 
Republicans. Let them know that this recent ploy by the Gore campaign is an 
outrageous insult to the men and women of our Armed Forces (you can get the 
addresses, phone numbers and e-mail addresses of your elected Congress people 
and Senators at http://www.visi.com/juan/congress/

3) Call your local talk radio show or TV news show and let them know your 
strong views on this issue

4) Write a letter to the editor of your local, regional or national 
newspapers on this important subject

5.) Finally, forward this  e-mail to your own e-mail list - to all of your 
friends and neighbors who care about our men and women overseas and want the 
truth to come out in Florida

This battle SHOULD be over.  George W. Bush and Dick Cheney won on November 
7.  But because Al Gore refuses to accept the results, the fight goes on.  
Please help the RNC give Governor Bush and Secretary Cheney the support they 
need.


Sincerely,

Jim Nicholson
Chairman

Democrats' vote scheme
November 20, 2000
BY ROBERT NOVAK SUN-TIMES COLUMNIST
WASHINGTON--It was 4:30 a.m. in Jacksonville, Fla., Saturday when two 
Democratic lawyers pumped their fists in the air and congratulated each 
other. The local canvassing board had just thrown out overseas absentee 
ballots of 44 U.S. service personnel. Their defect: no postmarks.

The board disenfranchising the service personnel was controlled by 
Republicans, an irony reflective of the fight for Florida. Befuddled 
Republicans were acting like good bureaucrats, following the letter of the 
law. Delighted Democrats were part of a coolly crafted scheme to win 
Florida--and the presidency. While granting maximum latitude in divining 
intentions of Democratic senior citizens on the south Florida Gold Coast, the 
predominantly Republican votes of young men and women serving their country 
abroad would be scrutinized with no latitude.
When Al Gore and George W. Bush finished in a Florida dead heat, Republicans 
viewed it like a normal recount. Democrats, in contrast, treated it like a 
continuation of the 2000 campaign.

Gore's operatives have made no secret of their Florida arithmetic. They 
calculated that the 300-vote Bush statewide margin following the full machine 
recount would be erased by Gold Coast hand recounts so long as Gore's deficit 
on overseas absentee ballots did not exceed 1,000 votes. The Gore campaign 
worked to make sure that did not happen.

Mark Herron, a lawyer from the state capital of Tallahassee engaged in the 
Gore campaign legal effort, last Wednesday sent off a five-page letter to 
colleagues around the state addressed to ""FDP (Florida Democratic Party) 
Lawyer."" The subject: ""Overseas Absentee Ballot Review and Protest."" It 
amounted to a quickie guide for tossing out the serviceman's vote.

It worked. In Jacksonville, officials ignored an affidavit from an aircraft 
carrier postal clerk swearing that mail sent by naval personnel often lacks a 
postmark. Consequently, plenty of sailors lost their vote at 4:30 Saturday 
morning (including, for example, Donnie Haynes, Michael Gentry and Clifford 
Shearer from the USS George Washington).

Brevard County Republican Chairman Ray Marino went home at 11:30 p.m. Friday 
after seven and one-half hours of inspecting overseas ballots and wrote this 
memo:
""Gore had five attorneys there. Their sole objective was to disenfranchise 
the military absentee votes. They challenged each and every vote. Their sole 
intent was to disqualify each and every absentee voter. They constantly 
challenged military votes that were clearly legitimate, but they were able to 
disqualify them on a technicality.""

In Broward County, 92 overseas ballots were accepted and 304 rejected. In 
Miami-Dade County, 110 out of 113 were turned down. Statewide, 2,203 ballots 
were accepted and 1,420 rejected. As a result, Bush's net overseas gain was 
only 630, for an overall Florida lead of 930.

That meant only 930 votes need be won by Gore in the hand-counting of heavily 
Democratic Broward, Miami-Dade and Palm Beach counties. They were working 
hard at it. David Fulcher, a lawyer from Jackson, Miss., sent to Palm Beach 
to help out, described to me a scene of chaos and confusion--of Bush ballots 
put in the Gore pile, followed by protests and arguments.

It became clear at midweek, however, that Palm Beach would not yield enough 
new Gore votes. Pressure was successfully applied to canvassing boards in 
Broward and Miami-Dade to reverse themselves and order countywide hand 
recounts. But late Saturday, when Gore planners became concerned about 
surpassing the 930-vote margin in the three counties, the rules were suddenly 
changed to permit easier tests for reading the intention of any voter who 
failed to make a hole in the punch card.

Summary of Energy Technology Bulletin:

* The three-pack of Capstone microturbines capable of generating 90kW
of electricity has surpassed 6,000 hours (9 months) of non-stop operation at
a PanCanadian Petroleum oilfield in Alberta.  Not only has the units
achieved this length of operation, but they have done so at maximum output
with 100% availability.  Owing to their success with these units,
PanCanadian recently placed another three-pack of Capstone microturbines at
their Pelican Lake facility.
* Following the announcement that the exclusive joint development
agreement for fuel processor technology between UOP and Avista Labs
(subsidiary of Avista Corporation) would expire and not be renewed, UOP
intends to offer this fuel processor technology on a non-exclusive basis to
various fuel cell developers.
* Bergerat Monnoyeur Travaux Publics (BME), a Caterpillar dealer in
France, has ordered 51 Active Power flywheels (CleanSource(tm) DC) valued at
$1.4 million.  The units will be used to protect a 10 MW wafer fab facility
owned by STMicroelectronics in that country.

************************************************************************
Help the RNC fight for fair elections!

https://www.econtributor.net/Contribution/Contribution.cfm?AID=PNCELAKMZHHA
************************************************************************

Al Gore is attempting to reverse the outcome of the election by any means 
necessary.  That includes tampering with the Electoral College itself.

Democrat operatives have begun clandestine background checks on Republican 
electors already certified from the 29 states George W. Bush won on November 
7.  They are looking for ways to persuade -- or intimidate -- Republican 
electors into changing their votes.

With Florida's 25 electoral votes, George W. Bush has a total of 271 
electoral votes.  (270 are needed to win.)  That means a shift of three would 
give Al Gore a majority -- and there are people in Gore's camp who seem to 
think private investigators can sway enough votes to win.

This is outrageous.  Already Al Gore has flooded Florida with lawyers, 
attempting to win in court what he lost at the ballot box.  He is pushing for 
partisan, rigged recounts in Democrat controlled counties.   He is demanding 
that Florida's election laws be junked so Democrat judges can impose a brand 
new, ad hoc system to accommodate the Democrats' frantic legal maneuvers.

Now the Gore camp is tampering with Electors.  Al Gore will do anything to 
win.  I've attached a Wall Street Journal report on the Democrats undercover 
assault on Republican electors.  Read it and draw your own conclusions.

This election should be OVER.  Because Al Gore refuses to accept the results, 
the fight continues.  The RNC is working to defend the integrity of the vote, 
not only in Florida but also in other close states like Oregon, Wisconsin  
and New Mexico as well.  We will fight this to the end, and we are confident 
we will prevail.  But we need your help.

We realize that we have asked a great deal from you in the past few days, but 
the future of our country may well be at stake.  We need to squelch this 
effort to steal Republican votes in the Electoral College in its infancy.

The Democrat Electoral College tampering is being led by Bob Beckel, who you 
may remember as Walter Mondale's campaign manager in 1984.  Below is Mr. 
Beckel's contact information.  Please contact him and express your outrage at 
his low handed tactics.

In addition, please do the following five things to help. Your efforts could 
help make the difference:

1) If you haven't done so already, take a minute to make a contribution to 
the RNC to help defend the integrity of the electoral process -- a process 
George W. Bush and Dick Cheney won fairly on November 7 and which must not be 
overturned by Democrat dirty tricks now

If you'd rather give by check, follow this link to print out a form:
http://www.rncfc.org/econtributor/mailcheck2.htm

2) Call, e-mail and write your local elected officials, Democrats and 
Republicans. Let them know that this recent ploy by the Gore campaign is an 
outrageous attempt to undercut our Constitutional Democracy (you can get the 
addresses, phone numbers and e-mail addresses of your elected Congress people 
and Senators at http://www.visi.com/juan/congress/ )

3) Call your local talk radio show or TV news show and raise these issues.

4) Write a letter to the editor of your local, regional or national 
newspapers on these subjects.

5) Finally, send this e-mail on to your own e-mail list - to all of your 
friends and neighbors who are interested in knowing the truth about what is 
going on in Florida.

extremely important.  Please help as generously as you can.  Thank you.

Gore Resolves to Stay on the Offensive
As Democratic Aides Rally to His Cause
By GLENN R. SIMPSON, TOM HAMBURGER and LAURIE COHEN
Staff Reporters of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL
(Beginning of article omited).
......One battle-tested Democratic consultant has even begun a quiet 
intelligence-gathering operation that could aid a last-ditch Gore strategy in 
the Electoral College. Bob Beckel, who managed Walter Mondale's 1984 
Democratic presidential campaign and has close ties to Mr. Christopher, has 
been checking into the background of Republican electors, with an eye toward 
persuading a handful of them to vote for Mr. Gore. If Mr. Bush eventually 
prevails in Florida but wins none other of the most closely contested states, 
he would have 271 electoral votes. Three GOP defections could make Mr. Gore 
president.
""It is information gathering on my part, using my own network,"" Mr. Beckel 
said, confirming an operation he set in motion days after the Nov. 7 
election. ""I call on mostly Democrats, but some Republicans, too, and ask. 
'Who are these electors, and what do you know about them?' I just wanted to 
know who these electors are.""
Mr. Beckel, who owns a political-analysis business based in Arlington, Va., 
said he is working independently, ""on an ad-hoc basis,"" and hasn't yet 
contacted any electors directly. ""I wouldn't do that without first informing 
the Gore campaign,"" he said.

The U.S. Supreme Court agreed to intervene in the Florida presidential 
recount, saying Friday it will hear one of George W. Bush's appeals that 
seeks to bar hand-counted ballots in the disputed election. In a stunning 
development and a victory for Bush, the nation's highest court said it will 
hear arguments Dec. 1 on whether to overturn the Florida Supreme Court's 
decision that allowed manually recounted votes to be added to Florida's vote 
total.

Statement On Florida Supreme Court Rejection Of Gore Campaign Demand For 
Miami-Dade Recount

""We are pleased with the Supreme Court decision. It was our strong belief 
that the Florida Supreme Court would deny this motion. The court had already 
extended the statutory deadline for an additional 12 days and Al Gore was 
asking them to extend it yet again.

""Thursday night Al Gore thanked the canvassing boards for their hard work and 
praised the Supreme Court decision. Since then he has sued one of those 
canvassing boards and asked the Supreme Court to change its mind. It seems Al 
Gore wants the Court to keep extending the deadline until he can count the 
votes enough times to change the result.""

Facts On Illinois Ruling On Dimpled Ballots

 ~ The Illinois Supreme Court Ruling was incorrectly cited by the Gore 
campaign and the Florida Supreme Court, and does NOT require dimpled ballots 
to be counted.

~ In fact, in the Illinois case, dimpled ballots were not counted at all. 
Illinois attorney Burton Odelson, who represented the challenger in the 1990 
Illinois case, said, ""the judge did not count ballots that were indented 
because he could not determine the voters' intent.""

~ Contrary to the arguments made by David Boies for the Gore campaign, Cook 
County Circuit Judge Francis Barth said, ""I don't believe the fact that an 
impression standing alone counts necessarily that this voter intended then to 
vote.""

~ Of the 27 disputed ballots the Illinois Supreme Court ordered Judge Barth 
to examine, he rejected nine dimpled ballots because, as he said, the dents 
were insufficient to prove the voter's intent. He rejected four others with 
pinholes that were misaligned, accepted three ""hanging chads,"" in which the 
perforation was partially attached, and approved five ballots punctured by 
pinholes. Six
disputed ballots were withdrawn.

~ Michael Levelle, a Democrat lawyer representing the Republican candidate in 
Illinois, initially signed an affidavit on behalf of the Gore campaign saying 
to the best of his recollection, he believed Judge Barth counted indented 
ballots. But when later told that Judge Barth did not include dimpled 
ballots, Levelle recanted: ""I couldn't
remember details. The affidavit was more general than specific.""

What About Today's Action on Military Ballots?

~ To protect the rights of our military men and women to have their votes 
count, the Bush-Cheney campaign today is asking a Florida Circuit Court in 
Tallahassee to require canvassing boards to immediately go back and review 
overseas military ballots for inclusion in the final vote tally.

~ We urge Al Gore to support this action.

~ One week ago tonight, in an orchestrated effort that included a five-page 
memo by a Gore attorney, Al Gore's supporters objected to as many military 
ballots as they could find. The Gore campaign never should have knocked out 
the votes of the men and women who wear our nation's uniform.

~ That's no way to treat the men and women who serve our country. They never 
should have taken that action in the first place.

~ Today is the day to right this wrong.

~ A State Judge will conduct a hearing at 2:00 today in Leon County to hear 
our case. We hope the Judge will ask the Boards to review these military 
ballots so our servicemen and women aren't disenfranchised.

~ Given the remarks made about counting military ballots by Senator 
Lieberman, Florida's Democratic Senator Bob Graham, and Florida's Democratic 
Attorney General (and chairman of Gore's Florida campaign) Bob Butterworth, 
we can't imagine the Gore campaign will once again oppose the voting rights 
of our servicemen and women.

The Greenwood Position
Now we must fight for our country
BY PEGGY NOONAN
Friday, November 24, 2000

""We must fight. And we all know it. And it's fine.

""We like to complain, those of us of a certain age, that history has never 
given us the gaudy challenges it gave our parents and grandparents. But we've 
had our traumas, and from the time we were children: assassinations, riots, 
Vietnam, Watergate, the ayatollah, a stuck economy, the fall of the wall. 
We've had our moments.

""And now we face a great trial.

""And we're up to it.

""So let's go.""

Washington Post
Gore Can't Heal the Hurt
By Richard Cohen
Friday, November 24, 2000

""I voted for Al Gore. I did so because I have known him since he was a 
congressman from Tennessee. I admire his intellect, his seriousness of 
purpose, his capacity for hard work and study, his political values, his 
experience and his knowledge. That being said, I now think that
under current circumstances he would not be the right man for the presidency. 
If I could, I would withdraw my vote. In the terminology of the moment, put 
me down as a hanging chad.

""I still think precisely as I have about Gore. But those 'current 
circumstances' I just mentioned change everything. Given the present 
bitterness, given the angry irresponsible charges being hurled by both camps, 
the nation will be in dire need of a conciliator, a likable guy
who will make things better and not worse. That man is not Al Gore. That man 
is George W. Bush.

""Bush has incessantly proclaimed himself as that sort of guy--'a uniter, not 
a divider.' The tendency is to dismiss that sort of chest-thumping as 
campaign nonsense, but in Bush's case it appears to be true. After all, the 
Bush boomlet began among his fellow Republican governors, each of whom 
probably thought the next president should be
none other than himself.

""So it says something about Bush that the governors were able to coalesce 
around him. Some of these governors knew Bush quite well, some hardly at all, 
but the fact remains that they all seemed to genuinely like the guy and 
respected his leadership abilities.

""You hear the same sort of thing from people who worked with Bush in private 
enterprise. I talked with one of them once, a Democrat who disagreed with 
Bush on many issues. Yet he, too, praised Bush's leadership abilities, his 
talent for bringing order out of chaos and for reaching some sort of 
consensus. That man's testimony impressed
me. His disagreements with Bush were real, his admiration for him profound.

""Gore, on the other hand, has little of those abilities. His own party is 
sore at him for taking the one-two punch of peace and prosperity and running 
a race that is still not concluded. His performance was as erratic as his 
uniform-of-the-day: earth tones on Tuesday, business suit on Wednesday. The 
country sensed that either he did not know
himself, or what he did know the country would not like.""

Wall Street Journal
How Democrats Wage Political War
-Controlling the government is imperative to the party's survival.
BY CLETA MITCHELL
Monday, November 20, 2000

""In case you're bewildered by the machinations of the Gore
campaign-turned-law-firm, let there be no doubt that the goings on in Florida 
are perfectly in keeping with the way Democrats normally think and behave. 
Lawsuits are a key part of the Democrats' political strategy, so nothing 
about Florida should surprise anyone who has spent time in the Democratic 
Party.

""Until 1995, I was a Democrat. I've been a Democrat elected official, a party 
official and an active party member, so I know how Democrats think.

""Democrats know and internalize, understand and are motivated by, certain 
ideas, concepts and principles that seem to be foreign to Republicans. And 
Democrats are elated that Republicans don't know or function under the same 
ideas. These basic rules of Democratic thinking are at work in Florida. This 
primer should help explain what makes the Democrats tick.

""Rule 1: If we don't win, we don't eat.

""Rule 2: State courts are 'home' to Democrats.

""Rule 3, the 'golden rule': He who makes the rules wins the gold.""

Exit Polling Says At Least 1.5% Of Americans Did Not Vote In
Presidential Contest

While the Gore campaign says dimpled ballots must be counted because every 
voter obviously intended to vote in the Presidential contest, FOX NEWS 
reports that at least 1.5% of voters told exit pollsters on November 7 that 
they did not vote in the presidential race. Experts say this understates the 
actual percentage of people who voted in down ballot races, but NOT in the 
presidential contest.

The number of ""undervoters"" in the three Florida recount counties the Gore 
campaign is trying to mine for additional votes is roughly 1.5-2.25%, well 
within the range suggested by the exit polls.

,11/27/2000,,benjamin.morton@ssmb.com,,,Introducing The Power Curve II,"Introducing the Power Curve II
The November Forward Price Curve (updated from our September analysis)
Introducing the Spark Spread
Comparing the Energy Merchants

Summary of key points:

* Power prices have growth tighter since our September analysis; 2001
forward prices are higher in every region by an average of 5%.
* The national average forward price is 23% higher in 2001 than in
2000.
* We introduce the spark spread in this report.  We expect a slightly
wider power/gas spread in 2001, although natural gas prices continue to
climb to record levels. This is bullish for generators.
* Generators are off 29% from summertime peaks; we suggest
accumulating prior to next summer.  We highlight Calpine, NRG Energy, and
Southern Energy.
* We also recommend energy merchants, whose strong trading skills
offer protection in any commodity pricing environment.  We recommend Enron,
Dynegy, and Duke Energy.  (See our Merchant Matrix on page 7.)

concede.

Thank you,
Jim Nicholson
Chairman, RNC

****************************************************************
SETTING THE RECORD STRAIGHT

MYTH:
There are more than 10,000 votes in Miami-Dade that have never been counted.
David Boies: ""[T]here are over 10,000 ballots that have never been counted
once for the presidency of the United States."" [Today Show, 11/27/00]

FACT:

* Every ballot in Miami-Dade was counted at least twice - once on  election
night and again during the automatic recount.

* In every election, there are a significant number of ballots that are cast
by voters without choosing a candidate in every race on the ballot, including
races for President. For example, in this election, 5% of the voters in
Idaho, 3.9% of the voters in Illinois and 3.6% of the voters in Wyoming cast
a ballot without registering a vote for President.

* The 10,000 votes (actually 9,000 according to their filing) about which the
Gore campaign has been complaining constitute only 1.6% of the ballots cast
in Miami-Dade. These ballots were counted - twice; they merely registered no
vote for President

* This reality reflects common sense: a voter may want to vote for a
candidate for the Senate, House or other office, but be undecided about the
choice for President. In particular, a voter who usually votes for
candidates from one party may vote for local or statewide candidates, but be
uncomfortable with his or her party's choice for President and yet unwilling
to vote for the other party's candidate. So he or she might cast a ballot
without marking a choice for President.

MYTH:
If you counted all the votes that already have been counted in some of the
recount, Gore would actually be ahead by 9 votes.

FACT:

* Democrats get to this number by adding unreported and unofficial votes from
the late manual recount in Palm Beach and from the partial manual recount
from Miami-Dade, and by subtracting the valid military overseas ballots and
some of the certified votes from Nassau County.

* The Florida Supreme Court set a deadline of 5 p.m. on Sunday for completing
manual recounts, almost tripling the statutory time period for counting
mandated by  Florida's Legislature.

* Palm Beach did not complete its manual recount by the Supreme Court's
deadline. Miami-Dade returned to its original decision of not proceeding with
a manual recount.

* The 157 ""interim gain"" for Gore in Miami-Dade came from a selective recount
of the most Democrat precincts. Gore won these selected precincts by
approximately 75% to 25%, while Gore won the entire county only by 53% to
46%. It would be unfair to use this interim change without counting
Republican precincts, too.

* Precincts in Miami-Dade, including those with predominantly Hispanic and
Cuban American voters, favored Bush. The Gore approach would treat these
minorities in a discriminatory fashion.

* Military overseas ballots that were valid under Florida and federal law
should be counted. Counties recognized this and counted them. Even Joe
Lieberman said that such military ballots should not be rejected.

& Even if you add the 157 interim gain for Gore in Miami-Dade
and the final manual recount of net 192 for Gore in Palm Beach (as reported
by the NYT), and then also subtract the over 50 votes that belong to Bush in
Nassau County (see below), Bush still wins by well over 100 votes.

MYTH:
Miami-Dade would have conducted a manual recount if not for the Republican
""mob"" that ""intimidated"" the canvassing board.  KLAIN: ""We think already
almost 160 votes were counted in Dade County before the mob stopped the
count.... But I think that to say that a mob can storm a counting facility,
stop a count, and then that's going to provide the end because a partisan of
the Bush campaign, Ms. Harris, refuses to accept returns and cuts off the
counting, I don't think that's the kind of end that we have to American
elections."" [GMA, 11/27/00]

FACT:

* The record shows that the crowd was reacting to the Board's decision
to move the recount behind closed doors, where it could not be observed by
the public or the media, and to limit the recount to only a select set of the
votes.

* No Board member mentioned the protests as a factor in the decision, and
Judge Leahy of the Board has already stated clearly that he was not
intimidated by the crowd. ???? The police made no arrests, received no
assault complaints, and did not even instruct the crowd to desist. The crowd
was quieted promptly.

MYTH:
In Nassau County, the board violated Florida law by adding votes from earlier
tabulations that had been rejected by the board as illegal.

FACT:

* On election night, all the votes were counted, but during the
machine recount, 218 ballots were accidentally separated from the rest, and
not counted. As a result, Bush received 124 fewer votes and Gore received 73
fewer votes than on election night.

* After the recount, the Nassau County Board supervisor discovered her
mistake, and tried to correct it. Because the Supreme Court of Florida had
held the date open for final certification until Sunday at 5:00 p.m., the
Division of Elections informed the supervisor that she could revise the count
to make it accurate.

* The Board (2 Democrats and 1 Republican) voted unanimously to certify the
original election night count - which included the 218 ballots - rather than
the machine recount total (which mistakenly omitted those ballots).

QUOTES:

Mr. Gore, the Wheel has Turned and it's Time for this to End...

""I think the vice president should take the high ground and hand it over,""
Rep. Julia Carson, D-IN
- Associated Press interview conducted over the phone, 11/27/00.

""Mr. Gore, End It Now,"" - Editorial headline in the Chicago Tribune,
11/27/00

""Enough is enough, For nation's welfare, Gore should accept loss,"" -
Editorial headline in the San Diego Union-Tribune, 11/27/00

""...I have grave doubts about whether it is wise for the country,  for the
purposes of just healing all of the wounds, for the vice president to
continue to pursue and to contest the results in Florida.""
- Former Clinton/Gore Labor Secretary Robert Reich

""His determination to keep fighting, even after Sunday night's  formal
declaration that George W. Bush won the presidential race in Florida,
presents the increasingly unappealing portrait of a man who wants to be a
winner at any cost.""
- Chicago Tribune, Editorial, 11/27/00

""The only thing to be gained by contesting the Florida balloting, as  Sen.
Joseph Lieberman vowed last night to do, is to put the nation through a
divisive ordeal that could provoke a constitutional crisis unprecedented in
modern times.""
- San Diego Union-Tribune, Editorial, 11/27/00

Palm Beach Canvassing Judge Charles Burton: ""...going into this, we  felt
that whatever standard we came up with...it had to be fair, it had to be
geared towards achieving a fair result, not geared towards achieving a
certain result...

""...the Democratic Party, the Republican Party, everybody agreed to the
standard we had applied in reviewing these ballots. It was only after about
four days into it that the Democratic Party went back to court to try and,
you know, basically have us change that standard because I guess they
realized they weren't getting enough votes.""

1. The creation of the Hawaii 125-0 concept - the creation of a revolver for 
FASB 125 transactions.  The deal will ultimately be fully utilized and has 
saved significant fees for Enron as well as eased execution of those deals 
(single source of equity, etc)

2. The concept of an internet-distributed $3 Bln Revolver - Initiated the 
concept of the distribution of the revolver over the internet which led to 
the launch of Dealbench.

3. The initiation and execution of project Grayhawk - Initiated the idea to 
take a large ENE stock position in January prior to the ENE equity analyst 
conference and led the deal team which executed the trade.  The transaction 
generated $85MM in profits for EGF.  In addition, identified tax leakage in 
the existing structure which was remedied.  Sure it looks like a no-brainer 
now, but it wasn't at the time.

4. Enron NetWorks, Enron Industrial Markets - Regional CFO - Financed MG 
acquisition,  created financing strategy for group and specific transactions.

5. Enron NetWorks Partners, L.P. - Structured and executed private equity 
fund which will raise 
$900MM of outside equity dollars.  Fund will close by year-end.

6. Created structure to monetize existing Pulp & Paper business through FASB 
125 or alternate structure to capture $75MM - $100MM in earnings and 
approximately $200MM in funds flow."

,11/29/2000,,stephen.meade@gbucs.com,stephen.meade@gbucs.com,,Updage on GBUCs/2Xchange and an interesting 100 million dollar --  --  article,"To all:

We continue to make progress on the EPP (electronic payment platform)
and are we are actually testing some modules internally.  The market
continues to migrate toward our space, which hopefully means there will be a
greater
understanding of what our system can do.  The existing 1.2 trillion dollar
market is possibly bigger than we thought.  We are having conversations with
several Fortune 500 companies who do non-cash trading in an effort to
ascertain the size of each of their current markets.

We are heavily involved in our current raise of 5 MM.  While we
are in discussions with a few organizations, we would be interested in
speaking with anyone who has an interest in a large market, experienced
management
team, closed loop settlement platform, and a company with ""HIDDEN VALUE"".
So if you are aware of either angels with $100,000 or more to invest or
seed or start-up VC's who can bring $5 Million to the table, let us know.

In today's market it is often difficult to determine true value in a
corporation, much less the hidden value.  This ""hidden"" value is often
called ""IP"" or Intellectual Property.  On that front, the good news for us
is; We own our Intellectual Property!  Why is this important you may ask?

Well, a business associate of mine at a company called Neo Media (NEOM) just
recently signed a 100 MILLION DOLLAR PLUS licensing agreement for their
suite of patents.  This is extremely encouraging as the market NEOM is in is
dwarfed in comparison to the global trade market where our IP is based.  We
have been very diligent in filing the IP documents and the attorney's have
issued a letter of opinion stating the validity and defensibility of our
claims.

This should prove extremely valuable as we move forward in building the
company.  As other competitors attempt to move into our space, they will
bump up against  our patents.  This will pose tremendous licensing
opportunities for GBUCs and 2Xchange. A very interesting point within the
NEOM agreement is the ""NON-EXCLUSIVE"" nature of the license.
Congratulations to all at NEOM, and thank you for paving the way for
corporations like ours.

		 Subject: Dabhol Status

Jeff/Ken:

I heard from Wade that there were a number of questions on Dabhol yesterday 
and I thought it may help if u received a quick update. Over the last 3 days, 
I have met with most key players in GOI and GOM assisted by some very close 
friends of ours. The start of the state assembly session has given some 
politicians and some vested interests an opportunity to raise issues about 
Dabhol in the assembly again, a feature that we have seen every year, at 
about this time, without exception and has led to a number of misleading 
newspaper reports. The usual suspects are behind the latest stirring of the 
pot. 

The facts however are as follows:

1. GOM (at the administrative and political level) and MSEB remain firmly 
behind the project and the commitments to it. They are concerned but at the 
same time looking at proactively working to find a solution. They also 
believe that they may have found one that is agreeable to GOI.

2. After discussions with us on Tuesday, GOM and MSEB are working on a plan  
(thru this weekend) to treat Dabhol as a national asset. The plan involves 
MSEB selling  power from DPC to the central government utility which will 
then pool the power with over 30,000 MW of power that they currently  control 
and sell the power onward to other states. The plan has already been 
discussed at senior levels in the GOI and finds general acceptance. Obviously 
the details are to be worked out and we are proceeding to help GOM put the 
outline together over this weekend in Delhi and GOM will then discuss it with 
MOP on Monday. 

Wade reported that it was felt that the seniormost GOI ministers be apprised  
of the seriousness which with we are viewing this situation. This was already 
done Tuesday.

3. The Indian Lenders to the Dabhol project have met and agreed to a 30 day 
waiver of MSEB delay in payment - agreed subject to review of the situation 
at the end of 6 months. They have also agreed to the Equity transfer - 
subject to lenders counsel confirming that there are no legal issues under 
any of the project contracts. This shows the lender support for continuing to 
move forward and buys us time to put in place the fix we are planning.

4. Ministry of Power has yesterday agreed to support an effort to freeze the 
duties on imported fuel at a lower level of about $12/bbl versus the current 
$35 or so. This will help achieve an immediate reduction in tariff from Phase 
I and make Dabhol more competitive. This proposal is currently with Ministry 
of Finance and our expectation is that they will review it favorably as the 
MOP is taking it up personally.

All signs that I have received in India over the last few days lead me to 
believe that the GOM is committed to solving the Dabhol issues at the 
earliest. While we all have concerns, they seem to be addressable and if the 
current plan is successful, they can  be sorted out within the context of 
current and existing documentation.

I have left names out but they are better discussed on the call that has been 
scheduled for Monday evening India time. Hope that this helps in the meantime.

Regards,

Sanjay"

RECIPE OF THE MONTH
Cranberry-Pecan Wreath
December has been designated National Stress-Free Family Holidays Month. One 
way to minimize the stress of the season is to plan an old-fashioned holiday, 
free of commercialization and the noise of crowded department stores. Bake 
your gifts instead. Put on some holiday music and turn the baking activity 
into a family get-together. If you'd like free gift stickers to go along with 
your baked gifts, they're available from breadworld.com. Go to the Bread as 
Gifts section and click on Wrapping Ideas  
www.breadworld.com/breadgifts/wrapping.asp

You might also want to invite your friends over one weekend for a pre-holiday 
bake-in. Few things bring family and friends together in a more caring, 
care-free way than the wonderful aroma of home-baked bread. Best of all, this 
recipe has been kitchen-tested by Fleischmann's Yeast home economists.

FYI:
Here are the survey results of November's Knead to Know Question of the 
Month. The question, referring to baking from scratch, using yeast, was:

How often does the average Bread Brigade America member bake?

Almost 71% of respondents bake at least once a month.
Of this group, 86% actually bake several times a month.

Of those respondents who bake less than once a month, some bake only for 
special occasions and the others only during the holidays.

QUESTION OF THE MONTH
Are Bread Brigade America members baking more this year (2000) than last 
(1999)? Once again, we have to depend on you in order to arrive at an answer 
to the question, which we'll publish in an upcoming issue of this newsletter.

As we noted in the last Knead to Know newsletter, the purpose of our Question 
of the Month is to gather general information which will help us learn how we 
can better meet the needs of Bread Brigade America members. There is no focus 
on the baking habits of any one individual, nor does your answer represent a 
commitment from you in any way regarding baking.

Please help us by answering the question below.

How would you compare the frequency of your baking from scratch using yeast 
this year (2000) compared to the prior year (1999)?

WEEKENDS ARE SPECIAL
Here Comes The December Weekend Calendar
The holidays are upon us! And with them, the stresses of holiday shopping are 
piling onto the normal pressures of the work week and the school week. 
Fleischmann's Yeast has a suggestion for coping: Use the weekends to share 
the holiday spirit without the holiday stress.

With our featured holiday weekend recipes, you can bake great holiday gifts 
instead of buying them. You can also turn weekends into pre-holiday and 
holiday celebrations with family and friends.

FIRST WEEKEND:
Freezer Rolls

We already told you about how baking the Fleischmann's Yeast kitchen-tested 
Cranberry-Pecan Wreath is perfect for holiday gift-giving. Now here's the 
first of several more delicious suggestions from Fleischmann's Yeast for 
gift-giving and for making other weekends in December just as special as 
pre-holiday get-togethers with family and friends.

Next to their great taste, the best thing about Freezer Rolls is their 
convenience. After you've prepared the dough, you can form it into crescents, 
coils or twists. Then you can freeze them for up to one week before baking, 
or you can bake them without freezing them at all. The choice is yours. 
Either way, the result is about two dozen delicious rolls. They're 
irresistible!

imagination and to tap into a child's natural desire to share the gift of his 
or her creativity. What better way to share the holiday spirit !

Congratulations to the Winners!
Ellen Tracy and her 13-year old goddaughter, Hannah Young, won first prize 
among the 10 entrants in this year's contest with a chocolate bread braid 
they made to celebrate Hannah's donating her hair to a program that makes 
wigs for cancer patients. Fittingly, their recipe, which symbolized the 
donated hair, was called ""Locks of Love"". Hannah, who had never cut her hair 
before, donated 12 inches of her locks to the program. Mary Ellen Botsford 
and Katy Botsford took second place and Christine Prowak came in third.

Dec. 1, 2000 

The Texans made national headlines this week when University of Miami head 
coach Butch Davis arrived in Houston Tuesday. Davis visited with Texans Owner 
Bob McNair and Executive Vice President/General Manager Charley Casserly 
before flying back to Miami. McNair then addressed the media at the Hyatt 
Regency Houston.

""We will be visiting with a number of people, some of whom will not be a 
candidate and others who perhaps will be a candidate,"" McNair said. ""Butch is 
a very highly qualified coach. He has done an outstanding job at the 
University of Miami. He has all the credentials in my view. He is certainly 
well qualified to hold the position.

""But we are just now getting started in this process and the visit we had 
today was really just to get to know each other.""

Davis, in his sixth season at UM, led the Hurricanes to a 10-1 record and the 
Big East title this season. Miami is currently ranked second in both the 
Associated Press and ESPN/USA Today polls. Davis owns a 50-20 record at UM 
and is 3-0 in bowl games. The Hurricanes have already clinched a spot in this 
season,s Bowl Championship Series. If Kansas State upsets top-ranked Oklahoma 
Saturday, Miami would face Florida State in a 1-2 Orange Bowl bout. If the 
Sooners win, the Hurricanes would play in either the Fiesta or Sugar Bowl.

Before arriving at UM, Davis spent six seasons as an assistant with the 
Dallas Cowboys, the last two as defensive coordinator.

""I don,t know what the future might hold but he,s certainly the type of 
person we,d like to have in our organization,"" McNair said.

McNair and Casserly flew to San Antonio Wednesday for a luncheon at The 
Argyle. Casserly had addressed San Antonio,s Touchdown Club earlier this 
fall. Minnesota Vikings Owner Red McCombs, a resident of San Antonio, also 
attended.

""We think it is important that we be viewed as a South Texas team,"" McNair 
said. ""We would love to have the fans in San Antonio feel an affinity for our 
team and like the way we play and the way we run the club. Our goal right now 
is to reach out to them and let them know we are interested in them and that 
we are going to have a first-class, high-quality operation.""

Casserly flew to Minneapolis Thursday to scout the Vikings-Lions game at the 
Metrodome before returning to Houston for scouting meetings Friday morning.

The Texans will hold their first Houston Texans Junior Training Camp Saturday 
at Memorial Park. The first session, which runs from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m., is 
reserved for children from Houston Parks and Recreation who participated in 
NFL Flag Football. The NFL Flag Football playoffs and championship game will 
follow the session. Texans fans can listen to KIKK 95.7 FM to win a spot in 
the second session, which runs from 3-5 p.m. Casserly and local NFL Alumni 
will be on hand to provide instruction. The event is sponsored by KIKK, 
Academy Sports & Outdoors and Gatorade.

where I thought we ended up, or where at least we should have ended up.

Jim is going to forward the specfication for Enfibre (only Enfibre) to 
Philippe.
Philippe will provide a team of people (from where is his choice) with no 
payments to be made to any other groups
Philippe will provide Jim with a price (the price will include a daily rate 
per person) for the specific project included in the scope and not the 
ongoing O&M etc
Jim then decides whether he wants to commence work with Net Works on this 
project or he adopts a different apporach.

Worst case with the above approach, Jim gets the EnFibre product up and 
running and the rest of his projects are dealt with as and when they come 
along.

Stilwell Lost $1.7 Billion/Day in Nov.Stilwell Lost $1.7 Billion/Day in Nov. 

By Christopher Noble

BOSTON (Reuters) - Janus Capital's parent, Stilwell Financial Inc. (NYSE:SV - 
news), saw its assets shrink nearly $2 billion a day in November as the 
hottest technology fund firm of the 1990s was hit by sharp market declines.

Stilwell reported on Friday it had $262 billion under management at the end 
of November -- a $38 billion plunge from the $300 billion at the end of 
October. That works out to a huge $1.73 billion for each trading day, most of 
it directly from Janus, which is 82.5 percent owned by Stilwell.

Much of the shrinkage is attributable to the dizzying drop of the Nasdaq, 
which logged a 23 percent decline in November, its second-worst fall ever. 
Only October 1987, the month of the stock market crash when Nasdaq lost 27 
percent, was worse.

The Dow Jones Industrial average, with much less exposure to technology, fell 
only 5.1 percent in November.

``The decline in assets under management has infinitely more to do with 
market depreciation than it does with investor redemptions,'' said Jane 
Ingalls, spokeswoman for Janus.

She declined to give specific figures for monthly net cash flow, but said 
November was shaping up much like September and October, when redemptions 
from Janus retail funds were offset by inflows through its institutional 
channels.

``We were very squarely positive in September,'' she said. ''In October, we 
had modest outflows on the retail side, but they were offset almost entirely 
by institutional flows.''

Janus had retail outflows of $772 million in October after September net 
redemptions of $46 million. September was the first time since December 1997 
that Janus had net outflows.

``For November, it is still a little early to tell,'' she said. ``But again, 
it's looking like modest outflows on the retail side and either flat or 
slightly negative on the institutional side.''

A shrinking asset base is just the latest bump in the road the once sleepy 
fund firm traveled in the 1990s. It has endured an acrimonious dispute with 
its former parent, Kansas City Southern Industries, over a spinoff plan and 
its funds have been punished as investors soured on the tech and growth 
sectors that are heavily favored by Janus portfolio managers.

Of Janus's 16 retail equity funds, 14 are in negative territory year-to-date 
and all of them lost ground in November, according to data from fund tracker 
Morningstar.

But recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (news - web 
sites) show Janus has stuck with its investments and has not changed its 
investment style.

Stilwell also includes the Berger fund family, Nelson Money Managers Plc and 
a stake in DST Systems Inc.

Stilwell is not alone to suffer from investor hesitancy in recent months.

Preliminary estimates from TrimTabs, a firm that tracks money flowing in and 
out of the stock market, show $4.5 billion of new money flowed into mutual 
funds in November, the lowest figure for the year and the smallest since 
February 1999, when inflows were $758 million.

The estimate excludes activity on Nov. 30 and is based on actual data from 20 
percent of the industry. TrimTabs extrapolates overall flows from its sample.

The money still went heavily to technology and small capitalization funds, 
indicating a surprisingly resilient enthusiasm for the sectors, Wittnebert 
said.

``The thing the public is really afraid of is missing a resumption of the 
rally of the Nasdaq and another indication of that is the continuing outflow 
from bond funds,'' he said.

we have heard concerning how low our offers are as opposed to banks, 
consulting firms and even El Paso and Dynegy.  Steve and I have known each 
other since our undergraduate days and as you can tell from the attached he 
is a great Enron supporter on campus.  For everyone's information we have 
made 4 offers to Baylor undergrads and I will be surprised if we get any 
acceptances (one of the guys has already accepted with Chase for $20,000 more 
than our offer and told me that El Paso and Dynegy are both offering about 
$10,000 to $15,000 more than we are, not insignificant to an undergrad).  I 
am concerned that if we are low at Baylor (where we have concentrated on 
identifying the top 4 or 5 students) that the problem will be pervasive and 
our acceptance rate will be very low or only improved by students who didn't 
receive other offers (i.e. average performers).  

Thanks for your time."

Summary of Energy Technology Bulletin:

* Siemens Westinghouse and four European utilities have formed a
consortium to build a 1 MW hybrid power generation plant that will combine a
Siemens solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) and a microturbine, which will be
supplied by the consortium utilities.  The unit will be tested as a
pre-commercial system for the European market and is expected to be in
operation by October 2003 at an Energie Baden-Wurttenberg AG (EnBW) facility
in Marbach, Germany.
* Two European utilities have awarded Siemens Westinghouse contracts
for their tubular solid oxide fuel cell system.  The two pre-commercial
units, one of which will be delivered to RWE Power AG in Essen (February
2002) and the other to Edison Spa in Milan (September 2002), will be 300kW
hybrid systems incorporating a microturbine and operating on natural gas.
* Real estate companies Arden Realty, CALPERS and RREEF dedicated two
large commercial solar power systems yesterday in Los Angeles.  The first
installation features nearly an acre of photovoltaic panels located on the
roof of a three-story office building owned by Arden Realty while the second
is located on an industrial building in Carlsbad, CA that is jointly owned
by CALPERS and RREEF (joint venture company is named CalWest Industrial
Properties).  Real Energy Corporation will sell the power generated by these
systems to the respective building owners.  Edison Development Corp., a
subsidiary of DTE Energy, supplied the solar panels that were built and
installed by PowerLight Corporation.

 I spoke to Ted Murphy today on the status of our limit and sector approval 
request and was told that I do not have your support.  I asked Ted if he 
thought this was a mistake and he replied that Mike was very direct.  In 
light of our meeting with Skilling and the feedback I got back, I'm not sure 
I understand your direction. 

  I essentially have no limits for the convertible arbitrage book as 
explained in the limit/sector proposal and will be forced to close the 
positions ( with out some form of relief ).  When we get Enron Metal's 
positions in currencies and rates added to my limit structure, I will have 
little room to engage in proprietary trading.  I need to redefine and expand 
the equity sectors and increase risk levels to maintain staff and generate 
the level of income we have planned in 2001.

  Mr. Alkhayat:

     Thank you for talking with me earlier. Enron's innovative corporate
venturing is a key part of one of Harvard Business School Publishing's new
best-sellers, Gary Hamel's ""Leading the Revolution."" Now, we're eager to
extend that conversation about innovative strategy approaches with an
upcoming conference in New York 

   We've targeted a small group of leaders to come together to talk about
strategies for innovative programs that contribute to the corporate bottom
line, both financially and strategically. We're calling this one-day
conference Corporate Venturing: Strategic Investing on Innovation's Edge.

   Ken Chenault, the COO and president of American Express and Michael
Ruettger, the CEO of EMC have both agreed to be part of the program, which
is now scheduled as a half-day gathering on Thursday, Feb. 8.  We would very
much like to have Mr. Skilling be a part of a panel/roundtable discussion
about ways corporations are exploring new technology and markets, generating
new business and creating new value. Mr. Skilling's experience in Enron's
strategic venturing ""from the inside out"" would be a particularly valuable
part of the discussion.

   This is going to be a small conference, limited to about 50 to 75
attendees in the audience, so there can be lively discussion. I know I speak
for HBSP and for our co-sponsor, Bain & Co., that Mr. Skilling would be an
important part of what is shaping up to as a very interesting conference. We
at HBSP believe this newly-launched conference series will become an
important part of our publishing and content development.

   Let me know if I can supply more information. Attached are our ""thought
outlines"" for topics that the panel would discuss.

Angelia

P.S. The panel line up now includes, Paul Guehler, VP of R&D at 3M, Rich
Bressler, CEO Time Warner Digital, Henry Chesbrough of HBS, Susan Mayer,
President MCI WorldCom Venture Fund, Brenda Gavin, President SR1 Fund,
SmithKline Beecham, Petra Koselka from Shell. We apparently have a
commitment from Cargill, but it's not in final final confirmation! 
  

   
     Agenda

Corporate Venturing
Strategic Investing on Innovation's Edge

Corporate venturing is the new engine behind the growth and revitalization
of companies that need to take advantage of technology and markets, expand
into new businesses and find strategic partners.

The corporate venturing conference will explore the strategies for venture
programs that contribute to the corporate bottom line - both financially and
strategically. Strategists and practitioners will lead discussions about the
best models for investing in innovation outside the corporation, as well as
managing the venture to ensure success. Topics will include corporate
venturing trends, managing the integration and relationship with emerging
companies, when and how to attract outside capital, and issues surrounding
retention, compensation and the spin-off of a corporate venturing fund.

This conference, limited to 50 to 75 attendees, is intended for CEOs, COOs,
CFOs, division presidents and other operating officers.

The Four Seasons
New York

7:30 a.m. Breakfast

8 a.m. Opening session
A Conversation with Ken Chenault,  President and COO, American Express  

8:45 a.m. First Presentation:
           The Venture Capital Revolution: An Overview 
                             
     Corporate venture programs followed a start-and-stop pattern of growth
over the last 25 years.  But in the past decade, the number of corporate
funds and the size of their investments skyrocketed. What is behind these
dramatic changes,  as corporations move to harness the venture capitalists'
model. Why should  ""outsourcing innovation"" be a part of your growth
strategy? 

9 a.m. First Panel
             The Strategic Venture: When to Reach Outside

       Corporate venturing is a complex undertaking. Research shows that
success depends on carefully targeted planning to integrate R&D strategy
functions and the corporate venture. This panel focuses on these questions: 

*   When do you know it is time to set up an independent business?
*   How do you think about venturing vs. expanding your core business? 
*   How are companies in every industry using corporate venture capital
as a tool to identify and develop new products ahead of the competition, as
well as create new partnerships?
*   What are the key measures successful companies use to determine
where and how dollars are invested in outside innovation? How can decisions
about what  NOT to invest in shape the funds direction?
*   How do successful companies balance the competing demands for fast
direct financial return versus long-term indirect gains in R&D? 
*   What are the strategic advantages in traditional funds, partnerships
with venture capitalists and hybrid forms?

           Managing the Venture: Partnerships and Opportunities

      A strong corporate venture program must align  the activities of the
innovators, operational partners and equity partners,, inside and outside
the  company This panel focuses on  these questions:

*   What kind of governance and oversight relationships should the
corporation build with emerging companies, to leverage innovation without
stifling new ideas?
*   Do new technology buildouts demand a different kind of management?
*   How does the corporate ""exit strategy"" - public offerings vs.
acquisition --  affect investments and partnerships?
*   How can  an internally generated idea for a new business be
""spun-out"", funded and managed as an ""outside venture? 
*   How have compensation concerns put increasing pressures on corporate
venture programs?

 I'm sure that Liz has alaredy informed you that I've called a couple
of times to speak with you.  My reason for calling is that I am currently
working on my applications for business school and as I'm sure you can
appreciate, recommendations are a very important part - since you attended
Stanford yourself.  I remember speaking with you about graduate school a
while back when I was in Houston, and the words ""it's a crap shoot"" still
stick in my head.  That's what you called the application process and I'll
never forget the quote.  As I plan to apply, I will most definitely see
first-hand how true these words are.

 In any event, I need three people with whom I have forged great
relationships with in my professional and academic career(s) who would be
able to write me a ""first-class"" recommendation.  I feel that you are
definitely one of these people.  I still hope that Enron would open an
extensive presence in New York; I would must rather be there.  I really
liked what I did; unfortunately it was just too far from home.

 I would really appreciate it if you would accept my request to write
a recommendation on my behalf.  I realize that you are probably very busy.
Although I'm sure you are willing to help me out in this regard, please
advise when I should forward the recommendation form(s).  Right now, I am
exclusively applying to Harvard for the January deadline, since it is really
where I would like to get my MBA.  The form basically consists of 6-10
questions (some are optional) that asks how well you know me (the
candidate), in what capacity you know/knew the candidate and what you think
about me.  Rather logical, right - after all it is a recommendation letter.
An electronic copy is attached to this e-mail that can be printed for your
reference.  Thanks again, Greg.  Looking forward to hearing from you.  My
contact information is attached below.  Please feel free to call me anytime
on the mobile phone - I mean this.

HOUSTON, Dec. 6 (LocalBusiness.com) -- Houston-based WoodFuel.com has teamed 
up with Atlanta's Future Energy Resources Corp. to supply raw wood materials 
that are targeted to fire up environmentally friendly power plants in Texas. 
The power-generating stations would use Future Energy's SilvaGas process, 
which converts agricultural, municipal and forestry wastes into a 
clean-burning gas that substitutes for natural gas. 
The process is designed to significantly reduce environmental impact compared 
to fossil fuel-based power plants, including the elimination of net carbon 
dioxide emissions, the company said. 
""Texas regulations and energy demands make Texas an ideal location for green 
energy,"" said Asfaha Tesfai, senior VP of business development for Future 
Energy. ""This alliance will ensure sufficient fuel availability to proceed 
with project development."" 
In August, Future Energy operated its SilvaGas process on a commercial scale 
at a demonstration plant in Burlington, Vt., which converted more than 285 
tons of wood chips into enough of natural gas substitute to power 6,000 
homes. 
The private company designed and built the plant in partnership with the U.S. 
Department of Energy, which provided technical assistance and funding for 
facility construction, and the Burlington Electric Department. 
Future Energy now is working to develop relationships, such as its alliance 
with WoodFuel.com, that would help it commercialize the process. 
Privately held WoodFuel.com is a business-to-business, e-commerce company 
that links buyers and suppliers of raw wood material online. The company 
aggregates wood fuel from its network of suppliers and delivers the wood as a 
renewable energy resource. 
Since its April launch, WoodFuel.com said it has created a total of 283 new 
accounts and sold 15,845 tons of wood fuel."

metals trades for Enron Metals.  This transaction will be added to through an 
additional $350mm of capacity from Credit Lyonnais and compliments the $750mm 
Warrants structure completed in September. 

Each transaction involves a sale of either Physical Metal or Warrants to the 
bank with Enron receiving an associated call option. The bank hedges its 
market risk through a  complimentary foward sale with the LME. The new 
physical metal facility will start receiving its first trades this week.     

The transaction achieves much for Enron: 
Deconsolidation of approximately $2bn of debt financed inventory which came 
with the aquisition of MG plc;
The creation of new capacity to grow the business beyond its existing base; 
Committed facilities for the business unit which are at a lower cost  than 
the original debt financed facilities;  
The creation of an additional  $2.15 bn capacity in the bank markets as the 
facilities extinguish up to 20 lines of existing credit in the banks market; 
A clearer reporting and control structure for the funding of Enron Metals.; 
A repeatable low cost structure which meets all tax and accounting tests for 
applications across all our business lines

See note below for detail but here is the exec summary.

We had a couple of big shifts on the curves yesterday which I want you to be 
aware of.  We wanted to put several major adjustments through on the same 
day.  The main moves are as follows:

Increased gas volatility - we moved the curve up significantly for the first 
several years. Lose o16mm
Power Peaks down, off-peaks up across the whole curve.    Gain o10mm

Because ""structured Derivatives"" is a separate line item, this book loses 
$43mm today, with power making approx $40mm to off-set.  The $43mm may need 
to be reported to Skilling, even though the real loss is just the gas loss of 
o16mm.

(There were several other clear up items put through, but the above 
represents the main issues to be aware of.  Net on the day we are up, and 
still expect to hit Q4 targets.).

Regards

Richard"

PentaSafe testing new security software

HOUSTON, Dec. 7 (LocalBusiness.com) -- PentaSafe Security Technologies Inc., 
which develops Internet security products, said testing begins this month for 
its newest software, which provides security for Web servers used in 
e-commerce. 
The Houston-based company's new software, VigilEnt Security Agent, is 
designed to protect information in the server from intrusion, loss and damage 
from both internal saboteurs and external hackers. It is expected to be 
available to the general market in the first quarter of 2001. 
The new product extends the company's current offerings, which protect 
operating systems, applications and databases. 
Steve Latham, vice president of strategic planning and development for 
PentaSafe, said the new software provides more than 100 system checks as 
online businesses prepare to move into production mode. It makes 
recommendations on how to secure identified risks and ""lock-down"" the secured 
system. Once the system is in operation, it continues to monitor and detect 
incidents. 
""It is important especially for companies that are in a hurry to test before 
they go into production,"" he said. ""A lot of times they rush through to get 
things ready and make some mistakes in their application servers so that they 
are not secure."" 
""It looks at 'is your system set up right?' and 'who has access?' as to who 
can make changes,"" Latham said. 
PentaSafe's new software locks down and secures the server, just as a 
homeowner secures the window and doors of his home ""before the storm comes,"" 
he said. 
The new software is designed to work with BEA Systems Inc.'s (Nasdaq: BEAS) 
WebLogic Server 6.0, the latest release of BEA's Java application server. 
PentaSafe could potentially work with other vendors as well, Latham said."

,12/08/2000,,enron.announcements@enron.com,esa_employees@enron.com,,Organizational Changes,"On November 8, the Office of the Chairman, issued an important communication, 
announcing significant organizational changes in Enron's worldwide 
operations. The purpose of this memo is to share with you the decisions that 
are underway to restructure  Enron,s operations in South America.  The basic 
organizational framework has been set. 

As you know, Diomedes Christodoulou and Jim Bannantine will be assuming new 
responsibilities within Enron. Replacing them will be Orlando Gonzalez and 
Joe Kishkill, who will become the Co-Presidents of South America, reporting 
to Dave Delainey and John Lavorato.  They will share overall responsibility; 
however, Orlando,s focus will be on direct sales origination, 
commercial/government relationships and regulatory issues.  Joe,s focus will 
be on wholesale origination, financial and operating performance and overall 
country management.  In addition, Orlando will continue as President and CEO 
of Elektro until its ultimate sale.

The existing, large integrated asset base in South America (excluding 
Elektro) will be managed and operated by Rebecca McDonald and Jim Hughes in 
Enron Global Assets, which is part of Enron Wholesale Services under Mark 
Frevert. Ultimately, there will be very close coordination in both Brazil and 
Argentina between Enron Americas and Enron Global Assets to ensure that our 
reputation in South America is protected, our asset positions are being 
managed prudently and that commercial opportunities surrounding these assets 
are pursued.

The remaining natural gas and electrical commercial activities in South 
America will be organized around the highly successful North American network 
business model.  This model employs people, market making, physical 
commodities, capital and assets to provide reliable, flexible and high-value 
products to our customers.  It is people and intellectual capital based and 
enjoys high rates of return on invested capital.

In the interest of pursuing this strategy, the following teams will report to 
Joe and Orlando:
 
The Commercial Origination team will be lead by Brett Wiggs.  The team will  
focus on covering South American markets, primarily Brazilian and Argentine 
natural gas and electricity, with the following goals:

? Generating new, innovative, reliable and high value products and services 
needed by the market by utilizing our commodity, asset and capital 
capabilities;
? Providing those products and services across South America and across the 
value chain, including wholesale and retail, based upon the highest value 
opportunity;
? Finding structural value arbitrages in the South American market and move 
quickly to capitalize;
? Assisting the Risk Management and Trading organization in managing the 
overall risk of the organization;
? Managing all new power and asset development opportunities in South America 
consistent with this strategy, and
? Providing the Risk Management and Trading organization information and deal 
flow.

The Commercial Origination team will consist of a diverse group of people who 
work as a single team which bring the required skills including commodity, 
capital, regulatory, asset, development, market, structuring, deal execution, 
finance and country knowledge necessary to reach our goals. 

The Trading and Risk Management team will be headed by Remi Collonges.  The 
team will continue to develop pricing information and manage the price book 
for the relevant energy markets in support of the wholesale and direct sales 
efforts.  Additionally, the team will work toward implementation of actively 
trading South American energy commodities.  This group will be responsible 
for managing Enron South America,s overall risk and will have a direct 
reporting relationship with John Lavorato in his role as head of the Americas 
risk activities.

The Argentine effort will be integrated into the overall South American 
Commercial Origination and Trading and Risk Management groups; however, we 
will continue to maintain an Argentine office headed by Michael Guerriero.  

The goal of the reorganization is to create a flat team oriented organization 
that is very market and commercially focused.  The following support 
functions will assist the overall business objectives of the commercial team 
and will report into Joe and Orlando, plus into their line functions in 
Houston.  The overall goal is to ensure that the South American business 
units have an adequate support organization to evaluate opportunities, as 
well as manage day-to-day business and risk.  Otherwise, the Houston 
infrastructure will provide resources as needed to manage peak requirements 
in South America, not unlike other businesses in Enron Americas.

These groups include:

The Government Affairs team, which will be headed by Sergio Assad, will 
manage the relationships with the relevant regulatory agencies as well as 
governmental ministries.  The primary regulatory goal will be to facilitate, 
in the near term, substantive changes to the regulatory rules to allow a 
functioning wholesale traded market in Brazil and Argentina. Sergio will 
assume his responsibilities upon completion of the Elektro sale.  During this 
interim period, Jose Bestard will continue to be in charge of the regulatory 
function.  Once Sergio makes the transition, he will also report to Rick 
Shapiro in Enron Government Affairs.

The Finance team will be headed by Britaldo Soares.  The team will manage the 
interface with Enron Global Finance.  Britaldo will transition from his 
current duties at Elektro upon completion of the Elektro sale.  Britaldo will 
also report to Joe Deffner in Enron Global Finance.  Rob Gay will be 
assisting Britaldo during the transition, while continuing his work on the 
Cuiaba project.

The Legal team, which will be lead by Randy Young, as general counsel, and 
John Novak, as deputy general counsel, will manage South America,s legal 
requirements.  Randy and John will also report to Mark Haedicke in Enron 
Wholesale Services - Legal Department.

Miguel Padron will become Chief of Staff.  Human Resources, Information 
Technology, Treasury, Accounting & Reporting, as well as Administration will

functions, as well as more efficiently manage key matrix reporting

These changes are consistent with Enron's evolving business strategy and 
reflect our continuing commitment to grow the company by maximizing our 
financial and intellectual capital.  However, in line with the new 
organizational structure and the near term potential for business in the 
region, further budget reductions will be necessary.  People directly 
affected will be notified shortly.
 
Enron is committed to continue the successful implementation of its 
businesses in South America.  We believe that as the markets develop, we are 
uniquely positioned to leverage Enron,s core capabilities and create 
shareholder value."

,12/08/2000,,alhamd.alkhayat@enron.com,alkhayat@pdq.net,,what a year,"An outstanding year!

2000, of course. It was extraordinary, by any measure.

How many years can you name that start with a great hoax -- Y2K -- and end 
with a monumental hoot -- the world's greatest democracy can't get the hang 
of how to elect a President?

We're not the only mad conspiratorialist to divine that the Y2K scare was the 
brilliant handiwork of a cabal of top computer makers intent on sparking 
sales -- and what a wildly successful scheme it was.

Few, however, are privy to the knowledge that the massive snafu of election 
2000 was no improbable statistical fluke but the Machiavellian contrivance of 
Ross Perot exacting revenge for being denied his usual place on the ballot. 
Besides, it finally occurred to Ross that he wasn't going to be President, 
and that made him as mad as a plucked rooster: If he wasn't going to be 
President, by gum, nobody was going to be President!

Even though election 2000 demonstrated a small defect -- an inability to pick 
a winner (but remember, nothing's perfect) -- it did put to rest some nasty 
aspersions that have long been cast on the workings of this blessed republic. 
Most particularly, it buried once and for all the cynical notion that money 
can buy the Presidency. Both parties spent hundreds of millions of dollars 
trying to do just that -- and came up empty.

So let's not hear any more nonsense about the Presidency being for sale. It's 
now quite clear that the Presidency can't be bought; conceivably, though, it 
can be stolen.

What remains to be determined is which of the pretenders can pull off the 
theft. Mr. Bush would seem to enjoy a congenital advantage, since the 
governor of the state whose votes ultimately will prove decisive is his baby 
brother.

On the other hand, Al Gore has the overwhelming support and counsel of the 
trial lawyers. Trial lawyers, after all, make a profession of knowing how to 
get away with murder. So they should find figuring out how to snatch the 
Presidency mere child's play.

Not the least remarkable thing about this most remarkable year is that the 
Supreme Court seemingly has abandoned its long tradition of following the 
election returns in favor of helping to shape them. The good part is that 
there are nine of them-seven mostly old men and two women of a certain 
age-assuring a majority ruling, unless one recuses himself because he simply 
can't stand Florida.

Only in America in the year 2000."

Election 2000:
HOW BUSH WOULD LEAD
As the election process crawls to its seemingly inevitable conclusion, it 
looks like George W. will face a slowing economy, a divided Congress, and an 
uneasy nation. But don't judge W., who has a history of being underestimated, 
just yet.

SHARE YOUR HOLIDAYS 
Members of the Houston Texans front office, including Bob McNair and Charley 
Casserly, donated clothing and canned goods Friday morning to KTRK/ABC-13,s 
annual Share Your Holidays food drive.

Share Your Holidays is a community-wide effort sponsored by KTRK to collect 
canned goods and other non-perishables for the needy in Houston and 
surrounding areas. The Texans dropped off their items at the HEB Pantry Foods 
store at the corner of Westheimer and Fountain View near the Galleria.

This year marks the 20th anniversary of KTRK,s Share Your Holidays. Last 
year, the food drive helped collect 1,475,000 pounds of food at 45 sites. 
More than 10 million pounds of food have been collected since 1980. Click 
here for more information on Share Your Holidays.

http://www.houstontexans.com/home/general.cfm?cont_id7438 

OUT AND ABOUT 
Casserly was the keynote speaker at the first Houston Texans Junior Training 
Camp, held last Saturday at Memorial Park. The camp was for children ages 
7-14. Participants learned the fundamentals of football through seven drill 
stations manned by NFL Alumni, including former Oilers Charlie Hennigan, Ken 
Houston and Don Trull.

Casserly and other members of the Texans, football operations staff also 
attended league meetings in Dallas earlier in the week before returning to 
Houston Thursday.

STADIUM TAKING SHAPE 
The west side of Reliant Stadium is taking shape as the holidays approach. 
These photos were taken from atop Reliant Astrodome. Texans PSLs and season 
tickets are available by calling 877-NFL-2002.

The partnership enables i2's TradeMatrix(TM) customers to choose Acta's data 
platform, which is designed to package and speed the delivery of the 
back-office data essential for selling, buying and collaborating online. Acta 
will develop a number of data cache solutions (Acta eCaches(TM)) to provide 
rapidly deployable, pre-packaged data content and connectivity to the 
back-office systems that fuel TradeMatrix applications. 
i2's TradeMatrix allows businesses to create both private and public 
marketplaces, while improving the efficiencies of all participants with 
content and solutions to support decision optimization for key functions 
including design, buy, plan, sell, fulfill and service. The Acta eCaches for 
TradeMatrix will enable businesses to share key back-office data with their 
customers and trading partners and provide rapid-to-implement solutions for 
integrating key B2B data from operational systems across the entire extended 
enterprise. 
Industry leaders and analysts have recognized the need for packaged solutions 
for B2B data integration -- the linchpin in a rapidly growing number of B2B 
initiatives. 
""B2B data integration is rapidly emerging as a 'must-have' technology for all 
companies who do business online. As a leader in B2B data integration and 
caching, Acta enables i2's TradeMatrix customers to grant rapid access to 
detailed and accurate data from enterprise systems,"" said Acta CEO Carol 
Mills Baldwin. ""Now TradeMatrix customers will be able to combine i2's 
industry leading technology with the most rapid data integration solution, 
essential for conducting business collaboration online."" 
The Acta/i2 partnership provides further validation that B2B data caching is 
emerging as an important new category in B2B integration. Unlike other B2B 
integration solutions -- such as application integration and process 
integration -- Acta focuses on data integration as an essential component for 
allowing companies to do business online, either through direct commerce 
sites or in marketplaces. The Acta platform consists of ActaWorks 
RealTime(TM), an award-winning data movement-and-management server, and 
eCaches(TM), a suite of packaged data caches that speed the delivery of 
back-office data in specific subject areas of eCommerce and business 
intelligence."

,12/11/2000,,daily@restructuringtoday.com,daily@restructuringtoday.com,,Meet the head of the leading firm in our business,"Meet the head of
the leading firm
in our business

Imagine the opportunity!
 Imagine that the leading energy company in the world has picked you to run 
the
company that it expects to be the leading retail energy company in North 
America.

 So you get a sharp competitive edge in the back room, you recruit IBM as a 
co-owner
assuring you the lowest cost per customer by a factor of two or three.
To get your foot in 27 million doors you recruit AOL as a co-venturer with a
commitment from AOL to promote NewPower,s wares.
You do an IPO and take in about $700 million for working capital.  The IPO is
over and the quiet period it required.
But the most important silver spoon -- so that you get your energy at the best
price and to protect you against price spikes -- you get up front 30 
Enron-trained
risk managers and traders.  Can you imagine having to recruit them?

To make sure this team is run by the optimum chief they picked Eugene 
Lockhart,
most recently president of Consumer Services at AT&T and before that president
of BankAmerica,s Global Retail Bank with its consumer, commercial and small 
business
banking services delivered through 3,000+ branches.
 Now, Lockhart's talking about his plans.
      Restructuring Today had lunch with Lockhart Thursday and reported in 
detail:

 *  How NewPower intends to actually start up the retail industry?  What is 
the
heart of NewPower,s business plan?
 *  How they'll make money in markets where margins may seem too thin.
 *  How he,s going to have 600,000+ customers next month and easily a million
by the end of 2001.
 *  What percentage of their sales come from the NewPower website.  What 
figure
is he using for cost of customer acquisition?
 *  Lockhart plans to have by the end of the first quarter or at the latest 
the
second quarter 750,000 customers making them by far the largest unregulated 
retail
marketer in the US.
 *  How does he think utilities will compete with the NewPower paradigm?
 *  What marketshare do they expect to get at first and then by 2005?
 *  What does he see as his biggest challenge?
 *  Why is this a good time for NewPower to invade California markets?
 *  Why will NewPower succeed where Enron failed?
 *  What,s the role of backward dating in forward market margins?
 *  Where NewPower gives a 20-25% discount on the commodity portion of a bill,
what kind of margin can it make now?
 *  How do higher prices help NewPower?  ""We,re actually in a very good 
position
given (that) the gas cost increases perversely will work in our favor ... ""
 *  ""We have a 10-year, exclusive agreement with IBM whereby we can issue a 
bill,
collect the money and care for a customer at lower cost than anyone else in 
the
industry by several orders of magnitude.""

We,d love to send you the two-story, detailed report on how the leading 
company
in our industry is going to get there and stay there.

For Dec 2001, how many producers were supplying this gas for ENA?  for EES? (doesn't have to be exact)

If possible, how many meter's are there supplying this gas?


I'm trying to put together information for the BTRC to show how detailed this activity is.  If someone from the BTRC just looked at the total volume, the price we need to pay the producer, and the price we can get for this gas today, the BTRC may decide that we need to pay the producers and sale the gas."

First, the worksheet.
I'm using the information Dominin Fed X'd to us 2 weeks ago.  
Allocation Balance Report by production month.  The monthy receipt volume net of fuel in columns B through D on the worksheet.
Imbalance Signoff Sheet by accounting month.  The accumulated Dt Imbalance is in columns F through G on the worksheet.
Allocation Balance Report.  The total adjustment quanity by contract by accounting month is in columns J through L on the worksheet.

Questions
1.   The Dec 2001 receipt volumes seem very low.  I'm sure that high line pressure was keeping most of the production volume from flowing.  Did we lose any producers between Nov and Dec, before the gas flowed?

2.  I am assuming that most of this gas was priced at Index.  Do you agree?


Let me know if you have questions.  I'll probably have a few more for you two.

As we discussed this morning, I need your help in getting copies of EES agreements related to retail efforts behind several NY LDC's.  The LDC's in question are Niagara Mohawk (aka NiMo), NYSEG (aka New York State Gas & Electric), and Rochester Gas & Electric (aka RG&E).  The agreements I am looking for are the master contracts that EES may have signed with the LDC's that addressed the release of upstream transportation and storage capacity with interstate pipelines (e.g. Dominion, Columbia Gas, Tennessee, etc.), operational balancing agreements that covered swing supplies, and the transfer of existing LDC storage volumes on the upstream pipelines.

Dominion package.

Summary:
No information on the large storage contract or where that balance is being
tracked on Dominion's system.  Maybe the large contract expired 11/30/01 and
Dominion only provided info on firm contracts effective after 12/2/01.  EES
had a smaller storage contract from NYSEG with a total capacity of 21,000
that did not expire until 3/31/02.  No information on the storage balance
for this contract either.

Producers
Dominion provide summary statements for production gas allocated to EES and
ENA with the last month being Feb 2002.  Strange thing is that in November,
Dominion terminated all the contracts where the balances are currently being
tracked for both ENA and EES (ENA contracts 8G001N, 8G001S, and 8T001S) (EES
contracts 8G310N, 8G310S, and 8T310S).

Per the Imbalance Statement for EES, the accumulated imbalances for all 3
contracts is (4809) as of Feb 2002.  The imblance was (2110)  as of Nov
2001.  So it appears that Dominion had allocated some gas out of EES's pools
prior to 12/2/2001.

Per the Imbalance Statement for ENA, the accumulated imbalances for all 3
contracts is 21,167 as of Feb 2002.  The imblance was (19747)  as of Nov
2001.

Important note:  if ENA agrees to pay the remaining producers left in the
pool, ENA would probably only be able to sell the current Feb 2002 balance
of 21,167 dth which means we would be paying Dominion back 19,747 of
imbalance gas.

Here's a brief recap of what happened on the Dominion issues from the EES side. I would like to get an idea of where we stand with them now and make sure I coordinate with the ENA counsel and ENA's position with Dominion. Basically I want to make sure we address our ""frozen"" storage and decide how best to resolve the local producers issue ( when to pay and from what date ).

	Basically the chronology from the EES is as follows :

Prior to Dec 2001, EES had storage capacity and Dominion transport released to us from Niagara Mohawk ( NIMO) for our customers behind that LDC. Over the summer of 2001 we injected approx. 680,000 dthms which should be worth $2.4 MM now.
Upon declaration of bankruptcy NIMO terminated our ability to serve customers behind the LDC as a result of the NY PUC ruling.
Also upon bankruptcy Dominion Transmission terminated all our transportation contracts including the transport for the storage capacity we had from NIMO. Dominion then took the position that our gas was frozen and could be used as an offset against the amounts we owed them.
Marshall Turner and Melanie turner of Weil Gotshal have been in discussions with the counsel for Dominion, Bill Saviers ( Internal ) Paul Vrana and Bruce Ruzinsky of Jackson Walker ( external )
One of the issues in dispute is whether Dominion can offset the value of our storage gas against payables due from ENA. I don't know if this has been resolved."

I am requesting that we reconvene a meeting as soon as possible to discuss the Dominion Transmission issues. I am getting phone calls, faxes, and e-mails almost daily from affected producers. We need to reach consensus on handling these urgent requests.

Several of our (former) producers are being required by Dominion to provide a signoff from Enron North America concerning our termination of their contracts and/or the release of the producers' gas back to the producer so that the producer can sell it elsewhere.  They are under a deadline to get these termination letters forwarded to Dominion immediately or their gas will remain unallocated and they will not get paid for January 2002 gas in March 2002 (as is normal).  

Producers currently requesting such termination letters include:
Pentex Energy Inc
Pacific Atlantics Resources
Gas Marketing Inc
Megan Oil & Gas
Triad Energy of West Virginia
Virco, Inc

In addition, the following producers are also requesting termination documents via an e-mail from potential buyer

Several  gas producers are flowing gas through Dominion Transmission pipeline to Enron's pool.  They have terminated their contracts with Enron, or have sent documents to us to terminate their contracts with Enron. They are calling now requesting letters confirming termination of their contracts and/or letters releasing their gas on Dominion Transmission's pipe from Enron's pool in order to satisfy Dominion Transmission's requirement for proof of termination and/or release of gas back to the producers.  Dominion Transmission is holding these producers' gas and is not letting the producers sell their gas to other buyers.


I have been trying for the last three weeks to discover the route these requests need to pass through in order to get the aforementioned termination and release notices. I have met with little success and fewer answers. Prior to my being involved, Nelson Ferries had forwarded a few requests through Contracts and Legal and had Fred Lagrasta sign off on them.  I also talked to several people last week in Contracts and Legal asking for help, but a process does not seem to be in place.

Please advise as to how quickly we can act on these requests.  Producers are fearful of not being able to sell their January 2002 gas (ie. not getting paid) and are facing severe financial hardships.  Please advise as to what I can provide or help out with this process.

A list of producers is provided below.  I am sure more producers will call.

I finally found the EES invoices last Friday so that answered most of my capacity release questions.



Questions for Dominion

Appalachian Producers

1.	How are production meters added to a shipper's pool (what forms are required)?
2.	Are the procedures in item 1 in the tariff?  If yes, where?
3.	How are production meters removed from a shipper's pool?
4.	By contract, how would ENA nominate the gas from the production meter to the Title Transfer Pool (contract #T00015)?



Capacity Release / Contracts

I believe some of these questions can wait until after Iris King does her capacity evaluation.  We have identified all the pre petition dollars that EES/ENA owes Dominion.  I have attached a file.  This data is also included in the VM_Contract Pymts.xls file.

1.  How do the CSC contracts work?
2.  Did NIMO release capacity to EES effective Dec 1, 2001?  If yes, when was this capacity recalled?
3.  Was the EES agency agreement with Owens-Brockway terminated?  If yes, what was the effective date?
4.  Have any other agency agreements been terminated?  If yes, when?
5.  What other agency agreements are still active?
6.  Who was the releasing shipper(s) for contracts 524464 and 531321?"

,01/26/2000,,katherine.kelly@enron.com,robert.superty@enron.com,chris.germany@enron.com,Re: Accounting stuff. Let me know what you find out. Thanks.,"Actually, prior to the CES acquisition we had between 200 and 500 little 
wells of metered production in the Appalachian area of our own.  These wells 
produce anywhere from 10 dt's to 10,000 dt's per day.  Most are very minimal, 
probably 500 dt's or less.  This production is produced on several gathering 
lines off of CNG and Columbia Gas.  A couple of years ago Columbia Gas 
started getting out of the gathering business and sold part of the wells to 
Gatherco, then they spun off part to CNR, and the remainder are still held by 
Columbia Gas.  Around the 10th of the month we get estimates from Gatherco 
and CNR as to what it appears that the individual wells are producing and 
then we nominate the gas, which takes up to several hours of updating time.  
The Columbia Gas meters we do not have to individually nominate to the pipe.  
We receive an estimate from the pipe for the total volume and they give us 
credit for it in our pool.  Sounds simple.  The problem comes three months 
down the road when we get the actuals from Columbia Gas as to what flowed at 
these meters and accounting has to go in and make payments to all these 
little producers. 

Prior to unify, it didn't really effect us.  Client Services would just zero 
out the one lump estimate that we had made and then they would go in and add 
each producer, the wells that flowed, the volume and make the final payment 
to each.  It was a very time consuming process and they had one person who 
was solely devoted to doing nothing but this.  Because unify was developed to 
put as much work up front in the process, client services no longer has the 
'back door' to get the payment out the door.  This means that each well that 
we have on Columbia Gas must now have an individual ticket in sitara  with a 
volume of 0 (currently our responsibility to set up) and must have at least 
one path with a volume of 1 for each month in unify.  Several months ago 
after converting to unify, Robert, Molly Lafuze, Kathy Moore, and Victor put 
in a massive effort over the course of about three weeks to get all of our 
own meters taken care of while still maintaining their respective jobs.  
Generally, it's the same meters that flow and when we set them up, we do it 
over a long period of time so the path just rolls from one month to next and 
as long as we keep up our tracking and balancing, we're just in maintenance 
mode.  However, sometimes new wells come up, at which point the process is to 
1) have the global group set up the meters and the counterparties, 2) set up 
a deal in sitara, 3) put a path in unify with a volume of 1, 4) create noms, 
and 5) track and balance.  Since we don't even get actuals to 3 months after 
flow, we usually have at least 3 to 4 months of catch up to do.  And of 
course, as you are aware, our systems have been running a little slow lately.

With the acquisition of CES we have taken on even more of the gas.  I've 
heard on a couple of occasions just how many wells this is, but I'm sorry, 
the number seems to have escaped me.  I know it is at least several hundred 
and that it is quit a bit more than we had previously. 

This whole subject is one that has been passed around by several people 
including myself, Chris Germany, John Singer, Jim Javins, and Scott Neal on 
more than one occasion.  One thought that John Singer and Jim Javins had was 
to have someone named Hiedi in Jim's office get access to our systems and 
input the gas herself.  Seems like a nice suggestion, except that she is EES 
and I don't think that we want her in our sytems.  By the way, John Singer 
and Jim Javins are the ones buying this wellhead gas.  They picked Hiedi 
because she works in the same office as Jim and they feel that she could give 
these little guys the hand holding treatment that they sometimes demand.  
Yes, it's hard to believe but it's the ones getting the $50 checks that 
complain the most.  They thought that Hiedi could also be responsible for 
making the payments.  

Anyway, that suggestion wasn't really panning out, so another suggestion has 
arisen as to setting up a whole new Enron entity that would handle the 
metered supply and we would be buying the gas from this entity.  First, we 
would have to take into consideration whether it would restrict our 
flexibility on Columbia Gas.   I'm not totally sure how to go about getting 
something like this off the ground, but it does have merit.  Another thought 
was to hire someone here that's sole responsibility would be the metered 
supply.  They would hopefully become a specialist in the area and would work 
closely with Gloria in client services, Jim Javins and John Singer.  The 
thought was to have them report either to me or to Scott Neal.  Chris and I 
tend to disagree in this area.  he thinks there is plenty of work for a full 
time person.  My opinion is that there is definitely a need for a special 
project over the course of some time, but that once the initial push to get 
the meters in is done that it is more of a part-time responsibility.  The big 
problem with that though is right now, the guys downstairs don't even have 
time to get these special type of requests done and it might be faster for 
Gloria to do them herself, if she has proper training and access to our 
systems.  However, regardless of which group gets the responsibility, there 
is going to be a need for a very large effort within the next month or so 
when January actuals come in and we should be prepared.

Any way, please give it some thought and let me know if you have any 
suggestions.  I'd also like to here what your views might be.  

Thanks!

But I need help 
understanding this one.  We have a process already to handle John's behind 
the citygate deals  

Since, the actual scheduling is done by CES in Virginia,  we never nominate 
this gas nor do we see actuals.  We hear about them from John and Terry and 
we are supposed to get confirms from the producer and CES.  Whenever one of 
these deals occurs, we have buys from the producer and sales to CES to 
account for these transactions internally.

It's my understanding that whenever John cuts one of these behind the 
citygate deals;  that Terry puts it into Sitara for him.  The offset also 
entered by Terry  is a sale to CES (Now the New Power Company effective Sept. 
1) with commercial (usually Chris Germany) confirming the sale price.  Angie 
schedules it in Unify under CNG and we create, track and balance like usual. 

Is that not the case here?  Is this something that's getting reconciled in 
Jeanne and Terry's project for CNG???

By cc: Angie, please get with Terry /Jeanne and Chris to help Wade.  THANKS!  
Please keep me abreast of the status.

 Our friend Sampson at Power Gas still maintains that their local
production behind PNG has not been nominated for July yet, which was 7500
dth/month.  Did you guys do a deal for this gas too?  He usually nominates it
all on one day, so Clinton/CES needs to coordinate with him what day to do it
on (right now the gas is out there on his side on the 17th).  I know Heidi
nominated the Phillips gas baseloaded thru the month at 443/day, but I was not
sure about the Power, until I checked and sure enough the nom isn't out there
yet.
 I can get help nominating it from PNG to get it through CES' pool but I
want to make sure that's what we need to do.  Just give me the word and I will

,06/19/2000,,john.singer@enron.com,chris.germany@enron.com,,Re: Peoples,"As of today, Power Gas Marketing volume has decreased from 7,500 per month to 
4,000 per month, until further notice, due to Peoples regulating the volume 
of production into their system.

Phillips Production is also down..

For July, I would sell 4, 000 per month supplied by Power Gas Marketing (pool 
to pool), and 300 MCFD x 1.03 = 309 Dth/day metered production from Phillips 
Production.  The Phillips Production meters are in CES's pool.  It will cost 
$100 per transaction to do a pool to pool transfer.  If Paul Leanza can use 
the gas through November, we should move the Phillips meters to his pool 
(309/Day).  The Power Gas volumes go through October.

John"
,06/02/2000,,john.singer@enron.com,chris.germany@enron.com,,Re: PNG Production,"June nomination into the pool should have been 500 Mcfd of production gas 
(from Phillips) and 7,500 Dth of pool gas from Power Gas Marketing.  You 
should check with Heidi Boyd @ CES for the actual noms into the pool.  She 
should have nominated these volumnes into CES's pool since ENA does not have 
a pool.
As far as I know, the pool to pool transfer fee is $0.04/Dth or $100.00 which 
ever is LESS.  Therefore,  for volumes over 2,500 the transfer fee should be 
$100.00 no matter what the volume is.

Phillips' contract for 500 MCFD metered production  goes through NOVEMBER 
(this volume may be less because of high line pressures).
Power Gas Marketing's contract for 7,500 Dth /Month pool to pool goes through 
OCTOBER.

If Clinton is interested in the volumes through contract expiration, I can 
ask Phillips to grant us permission to move the meters into Clinton's pool.

Any requests that relate to Appalachian transport capacity tickets will be 
sent to Terry Franklin.  This includes additional capacity tickets that need 
to be set up, changes that need to be made to existing tickets, etc.

Any requests that relate to CES Appalachian purchase deals in Sitara will be 
handled by Wade Price.  Wade will continue setting up new deals, adding 
meters to deals, adjusting prices (based on information provided by John 
Singer), etc.

Once the deal is in the supply list and the appropriate service contract 
shows up in the service list, a request will be sent to Logistics to path the 
deal.  

Please let me know if anyone sees a problem with going forward this way.  
Thanks.

production. Back in January, Noel Bartlo told me these deals stayed with CES 
Retail. John Singer believes the deals stay with him at Enron. If these deals 
stay with Enron, should they be at EES... since they are behind the citygate 
or do they stay with Enron to reduce the TCO delivery to the citygates for 
CES?  This could be a can of worms. 

Colleen, what is the contract interruption? Does the citygate production 
deals stay with Enron? If they stay with Enron, then does CES realize this? 
Are the producers receiving two payments, one from Enron and one from CES. 
Maybe this has already be discussed and decided, but I haven't heard the 
official word.

Currently these citygate production deals are deducted from the citygate 
delivery that CES needs. The numbers that Herndon LDC schedulers provide to 
Enron are reduced by the production. I think Chris put these buy/sells in the 
system to appease John and keep the Enron accounting system whole. Currently 
the market demand tickets in Sitara are reduced by the citygate supply. The 
pathing could be made easier by hooking up the citygate production supply to 
the market demand tickets, but the market demand numbers need to be 
increased. Then you could eliminate the buy/sell tickets that Chris Germany 
has been creating.

However if this production gas is not Enron's, then Enron is creating a lot 
of unnecessary work and the producers are probably receiving two payments.

As you know, Terry Franklin is beginning to transition into the Appalachian 
coordination role.  We spent time today with Bryce Baxter, Wade Price, and 
Gloria Barkowsky to determine how best to attack the current issues.

As Job 1, we determined that Terry's time is best utilized on transportation 
contract set-up.  Of course, Terry ""job description"" includes other tasks, 
but at this time, this is her #1 focus.  We decided this for the following 
reasons:

1.  Deals cannot be pathed without transportation contracts set-up in SITARA.
2.  In order to pay the producers and the pipeline, the deals must be pathed 
by Logistics (zero volume paths), and volumes must by allocated (based on 
actuals) by Gloria Barkowsky, Volume Mgmt.
3.  Wade Price, Settlements, is focused on setting up SITARA deals for 
producer wellhead purchases.

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

I'm sorry but as a manager, I spent the vast portion of my days and evenings 
involved in trading activities, in  meetings and trying to put out fires.  I 
have also been receiving on average 2 or 3 of these requests per day and I 
usually don't even begin looking at these until 6 in the evening.  Some are 
quick fixes, but the majority lately have not been.  Todays calendar isn't 
looking much better.

I contacted Wade on this last week, but have not received anything.  I hate 
to hold you back from making your payments, which is why we have spent 
another good chunk of time justifying a new position under Carrie Hollomon to 
handle these types of requests.  That position is now to be filled by Teri 
Franklin.  I'm sure that she is not totally up to speed on everything such as 
sitara, so please continue to be patient for awhile.  

So that this whole process might be sped up a little faster, I would like to 
suggest that you obtain the pricing information from either Lashonda or Wade 
and then pass the information that you need set up in it's entirety to Teri.  
If the information is provided in it's entirety this will keep us from 
setting up deals with incorrect pricing.  Which then causes us to have to go 
back and do further rework when either Wade of Lashonda informs us of the 
error, which is exactly what I received an
email on earlier this morning.  


Teri,

If you need any help with sitara or any other type of training in setting up 
these deals, please let either myself, Victor, Chris, or Brenda know and we 
will try to answer your questions.  Thanks for your help!

Transportation Rates team in a newly created position-the Appalachian 
Coordinator role.  Terry brings years of transportation, wellhead, and Enron

In her new position, Terry will be responsible for the following:

? Understand the Appalachian contracts/agreements
? Understand the gas flow methods and desired commercial results
? Facilitate set-up of transport/gathering contracts
? Facilitate set-up of facilities/meters
? Create purchase deals in SITARA
? Maintain transport rates coordination role for CGAS, CNG, CNR, etc.
? Review calc sheets
? Maintain purchase pricing
? Maintain intra-month volumetric estimates on CNR/Gather co

Terry will make every effort to trouble shoot and problem solve for both the 
commercial and operations teams.  In doing so, she will be looking to partner 
with the members of the Trading, Origination, Client Services, Volume 
Management, and Logistics teams to improve our processes in this very 
important area.   

Terry will be replaced on the Operational Analysis team, but we may choose to 
realign individual responsibilities to creatively manage the  current 
workload.  Terry will begin to transition over the next several days, but we 
must be very careful to maintain the current Volume Mgmt. OA process during 
this transition time.

You have great ideas about consolidating the deal tickets. That is a

want to check with your boss, Nelson Ferries or the Desk Director, Dick 
Jenkins. What I have found about Enron, if you have a good idea... just go 
for it... if it makes sense.

If your group does decide to consolidate these tickets... then please have 
the person responsible for inputting your deal tickets to do this 
consolidation. My understanding that Enron has hired someone to help you with 
the billing process for your appalachian producers... not sure if that person 
will also be inputting your deal tickets.

I'll ask Victor about the report by counterparty. CPR print manager has a lot 
of different print options and sorts for the Sitara Deal tickets.

I was trying to tie out a transportation deal in the books with my transport 
model.  I found that the transportation spreadsheet that the books are being 
closed out with was valuing extrinsic value over what my model valued it.  I 
reconciled the differences and the main difference was due to the blending of 
the volatilities.  I brought this problem up back in October of this year.  
Do you remember?   When I talked to Greg Couch today, those changes were not 
made.  I think that it is an issue with all the transportation deals.   

The problem is related to the number of days that is used to weight the 
daily/omicron volatility.  Basically, transportation is a daily spread option 
and if you look at a month like November for instance, you have 30 different 
daily options.  If you were to look at the number of days that the 
daily/omicron volatility should be used you would have the first option with 
1 day of daily vol, the second with 2 days of daily vol, the third with 3 
days of daily vol and so on and so on.  The average number of days that 
should be used to weight the daily/omicron volatility is 15 or the number of 
days in each particular month divided by 2.  The transportation spreadsheet 
is weighting that volatility with the total number of days in the month.  
This usually overstates the extrinsic value since that the daily/omicron 
volatility is usually higher than the monthly volatility.  

Please let me know what you would like me to do.  I have a call into Zimin to 
make sure that my logic is correct.  Thanks.

I think you're doing the right thing by first getting with Zimin to make sure 
he agrees and will sign off on this change.  Next, before we just change this 
in the model, I will want Greg to run ""parallel"" valuations to see what the 
impact will be on each person's book.  Then, we will get with the traders and 
see how they want to implement it.  Since the book runners are using the 
correlation to basically make the books have what they believe is a market 
value for capacity, I would assume that they may want to change correlation 
to offset the value change in the volatility; however, that decision will be 
left to each book runner.  

Let me know what you hear back from Zimin.

regarding the changes in extrinsic value for each of the transport books.  As 
we discussed, each of you should make a determination as to what changes in 
correlation you should make to offset the decreases in value due to the 
change in the model.  Since you have been using the correlation factor to 
adjust the values to reflect market, a simple change decreasing these 
correlations will offset the change in value due to John's ""fix"".  This 
change simply makes the transport model one step closer to properly 
reflecting the intra- and inter-month optionality values--Research did review 
the change and agrees that it is appropriate.  If you have any questions, 
please call me at x35514.

to change the numbering scheme on the existing Stentofon system.  To increase 
our capacity to support this expansion, we must increase the number of valid 
Stentofon address numbers.  Enron currently uses 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600 
and 900 series numbers for the addresses.  In order to add more addresses to 
the system, Enron will be converting the dial plan from a three digit dialing 
system to a four digit dialing scheme on the Stentofon system.  This 
conversion is scheduled to occur on the weekend of May 18th.

In efforts to minimize confusion, we will convert all Stentofon addresses in 
EB1 to a 4000 series number.    (i.e.  If your Stento number was 364, then 
your new number will be 4364.)  We will also change all speed dials to

Support KidSave and Help Miracles Happen. Every Summer.
 
Kidsave,s  Summer Miracles Program enables orphaned children ages 5 to 11 to 
travel to the  US and Canada, live with families and attend day camp. The 
program gives  families who may be concerned about the problems of adopting 
an older child a  chance to meet, get to know and in the best-case scenario, 
fall in love with a  child. The program gives prospective parents an 
opportunity to see and evaluate  first-hand the challenges and rewards of 
adopting an older  child.
 
In 1999 and  2000 Kidsave and adoption agency partners placed 432 children - 
96 percent of  children who participated in the program. Generally, 85 to 90 
percent of  children who participate in the program find homes easily through 
the program.  The remaining 10 to 15 percent require more work.
 
Kidsave  believes every child deserves a family. We are committed to placing 
all children  who participate in the Summer Miracles Program in permanent 
families or  family-like environments.
 
We are looking  for families to host children, and for others who want to 
help us make the camp  program happen for these 250 children.   As a 
non-profit organization, Kidsave depends on donations to raise the  money to 
bring these children here and find them families.  Please call Tonya Hoppe at 
281.286.8948  or tonya@tonya.cc to get involved in Houston,s  Kidsave 
program.

via Notes, and you will not be able to start using Outlook until it is 
configured by the Outlook Migration team the morning after your mailbox is 
migrated.  During this period, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) via your 
web browser (Internet Explorer 5.0) to read and send mail.

? Significant advantages to moving to a product that is more integrated with 
current Enron apps (Windows 2000, Office and Internet Explorer)
? More efficient Shared PC and Roaming User features
? Improved support and integration for Palm/CE devices
? Instant Messaging capabilities

,05/11/2001,,enron.announcements@enron.com,all.houston@enron.com,,Houston Ballet's Miller Theater Performance of Coppelia,"Houston Ballet gives free performances of Copp,lia
at Miller Outdoor Theatre in Hermann Park
8:00 p.m. Friday May 11, Saturday May 12, & Sunday May 13, 2001 
sponsored by AZURIX and ENRON

Considered the great comedy of classical ballet, Copp,lia  tells the story of 
a doll so enchantingly lifelike that she mesmerizes an entire village, 
captures the heart of a young swain named Franz and inspires the eccentric 
toymaker Dr. Copp,lius to attempt to transform her into a living, breathing 
human being. 

AZURIX and ENRON are Corporate Sponsors for Houston Ballet's Miller Theatre 
performances, helping to present these free performances of Copp,lia to the 
people of Houston.  Houston Ballet has a limited number of tickets for the 
seated area each night for employees of AZURIX and ENRON.  These tickets are 
available on a first-come, first-served basis by calling William at 
713-535-3235 no later than 5 PM today .  (Please be aware that all unoccupied 
seats are released at 10 minutes before curtain.)

Other, free, general public tickets for the seated area (max 4 per person) 
are available at the Miller Theatre 11:30 a.m. - 1:00 p.m. on the day of 
performance; for more information call 713-284-8351 for the Miller Theatre 
ticket information line.  Tickets are not required for the lawn area.  

About Coppelia
Copp,lia was first performed on May 25, 1870 at the Th,atre Imp,rial de 
L'Op,ra, featuring choreography by Arthur Saint-L,on and music by L,o 
Delibes. The work maintains a special place in the history of dance, serving 
as a kind of bridge from the glory of the French Romantic ballet in the early 
nineteenth century to the masterpieces of the Russian Imperial Theater at the 
turn of the century. Writing in The International Dictionary of Ballet, 
critic Karen Dacko analyzes the unique characteristics of the piece as 
follows: ""Copp,lia owes its longevity to its inspired, very danceable score. 
But the ballet is also remarkable for its perennial appeal and for its 
historical significance as Romanticism's grand finale and classical ballet's 
prologue.""
Copp,lia first entered Houston Ballet' repertoire in October 1974, in a 
staging by Frederic Franklin (who also performed the role of Dr. Copp,lius), 
and featuring scenery by Peter Farmer. In November 1979, former Royal Ballet 
ballerina Anne Heaton re-staged the work for the company. When Houston Ballet 
premiered its new production of the work in March 1992 featuring breathtaking 
d,cor by Desmond Heeley, Carl Cunningham of The Houston Post wrote, ""It would 
be hard to imagine anything to cap the joyous, gentle, and glorious looking 
new production of Copp,lia the splendidly prepared company of dancers and 
musicians put forth Thursday evening on Wortham Center's Brown Theater 
stage.""    (The Houston Post, March 21, 1992)
Heeley's designs for Copp,lia never fail to enchant, most notably in the 
second-act depiction of Dr. Copp,lius's workshop. The sampling of dolls on 
display pay homage to the era when automatons, or mechanical toys, were the 
rage in Europe -- and to Heeley's inexhaustible creativity. Among the 
eye-popping toys featured in  the workshop are a huge astrologer with a 
pointed hat and a robe covered in shooting stars and moons; a strongman with 
a handlebar mustache and barbells; Puss n Boots; an acrobat hanging from a 
trapeze holding the man in the moon; and a small ballerina dancing on the 
back of a goat. In the first act, the vibrant reds, golds, and oranges of the 
costumes worn by the peasants in the village conjure up a wonderfully 
picturesque vision of nineteenth century Bavaria."

Support KidSave and Help Miracles Happen. Every Summer.
 
Kidsave,s  Summer Miracles Program enables orphanage children ages 5 to 11 to 
travel to the  US and Canada, live with families and attend day camp. The 
program gives  families who may be concerned about the problems of adopting 
an older child a  chance to meet, get to know and in the best-case scenario, 
fall in love with a  child. The program gives prospective parents an 
opportunity to see and evaluate  first-hand the challenges and rewards of 
adopting an older  child.
 
In 1999 and  2000 Kidsave and adoption agency partners placed 432 children - 
96 percent of  children who participated in the program. Generally, 85 to 90 
percent of  children who participate in the program find homes easily through 
the program.  The remaining 10 to 15 percent require more work.
 
Kidsave  believes every child deserves a family. We are committed to placing 
all children  who participate in the Summer Miracles Program in permanent 
families or  family-like environments.
 
We are looking  for families to host children, and for others who want to 
help us make the camp  program happen for these 250 children.   As a 
non-profit organization, Kidsave depends on donations to raise the  money to 
bring these children here and find them families.  Please call Tonya Hoppe at 
281.286.8948  or tonya@tonya.cc to get involved in Houston,s  Kidsave 
program.   


Enron and Kidventure Camps are proud to bring you Camp Enron Summer 2001.  
Celebrating our third year, Camp Enron  will once again be providing summer 
camp for children, ages 5-13, of Enron employees and contractors. 

This year, camp will be May 29-August 10.  Ten, one-week sessions will be  
available and families may choose to attend any or all sessions.  Each camp 
week is Monday through Friday. 

The cost is $150 per week and includes all transportation, field trips and 
activities.  A deposit of $50 per week is all that is needed to reserve your 
sessions.  

To register, log on to: http://www.kidventurecamp.com/camp_enron.htm.   
Spaces are limited.

Enron parents simply ride to work with  their children and check them in to 
the Energizer room in the morning with the Camp Enron Team.  Enron Campers 
are loaded on Coach USA Buses and transported to our nearby camp. At the end 
of the day campers are brought back to the Energizer for parents to check 
out.  

It's that easy!

,05/04/2001,,enron.announcements@enron.com,all.worldwide@enron.com,,Organization Announcement,"Given the growth in EES it has become apparent that it is time to consolidate 
the risk functions between EES and EWS.  This will provide EES with the 
systems, resources and risk expertise of the wholesale energy groups 
necessary for it to continue to grow and take advantage of current market 
opportunities.

With this in mind and in agreement with the management of EES, two new risk 
groups inside Enron Americas will be formed to provide EES with pricing, 
structuring, retail and wholesale commodity risk management, logistics and 
back-office services.  These groups main function is to provide these 
services to EES.  We have asked Rogers Herndon, currently Vice 
President-Trading in the Eastern Power Group to manage this function in the 
Eastern Interconnect (this includes both gas and power).  Rogers will 
continue to report to Kevin Presto.  We have asked Don Black, formerly Vice 
President-EES Risk Management and Sourcing, to manage this function in the 
Western U.S.  Don will manage this group from Houston and will report to Tim 
Belden.

These groups will work very closely with EES to pursue shared goals while 
ensuring close coordination with the wholesale gas and power trading 
organizations.

These changes are effective immediately.  Please congratulate Rogers and Don 
on their new roles.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new

cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is 
currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly 
employee cost of $94.00.

If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to 
the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made 
as spaces become available. 

The Saturn Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be 
opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street 
level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Ring access is available. 
Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an 
exit in the event of elevator trouble. 

If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to 
Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your 
email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and 
receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new 
garage.

Enron Global LNG is positioning itself to be a creator and leader of a global 
wholesale LNG market.  The rising prices of natural gas in the United States 
and concerns over future energy supplies have created a bullish outlook for 
LNG in the U.S. and around the globe.   LNG has played a major role in 
serving energy needs in many parts of the world, but its place in the U.S. 
energy picture has been limited. An LNG market that spans the globe can 
supply vast amounts of otherwise stranded gas to the world,s growing appetite

,05/14/2001,,registrar@amunet.edu,larry.may@enron.com,,Registration Successful,"Dear AMU Student:

Thank you registering for classes at AMU.  This e-mail is your
confirmation that we have received your registration and that you are
enrolled in one or more courses.  We wish you the best of luck in your
class.

To ensure that you are properly prepared for your course, there are three
(3) more quick things you need to do:

Step 1: If Eligible, Get Tuition Assistance

If you have not already done so, you will need to go to your Education
Center or Human Resource Office to get completed Tuition Assistance (TA)
paperwork.   In order for your TA paperwork to be completed by your ESO or
HR professional and accepted by AMU, the following information must be
correct:

- Course Number and Title

- Course Start and End dates

- The amount per credit hour ($250 per semester hour).

Please know that Tuition Assistance Regulations require that we not
provide access to the Student Course Guide until the AMU Financial Aid
Office has received your completed TA paperwork.  TA paperwork may be
faxed to 703-330-5109 and is required before the start date of the
semester.  If you encounter any problems with your TA paperwork please
immediately send an e-mail to hstine@amunet.edu or call (703) 330 - 5398
ext 117.

Step 2: Order Your Books

In order to provide the best possible customer service and to allow
students to track the status of their book shipments, AMU changed its book
ordering process effective April 9, 2001.  It is now requested that
student contact MSB directly to order books.

Undergraduate Students participating in the AMU Book Grant*, need to order
books as soon as possible by calling MBS after registering for their
classes.   Ordering is easy:

Call 1-800-325-3252

Give Customer Service your name, and the AMU course(s) you,re taking.

Step 3.   Tell MBS what address to ship your books to - and you,re done.

After MBS has confirmed your book order, you will be issued a UPS tracking
number that you can use to check to the status of your book(s).  If you
encounter any problems with your book shipment, or if your book(s) do not
arrive, you will need to contact MBS at the number listed above (please
note that APO/FPO shipping times generally take longer than regular CONUS
mail so please order your books as soon possible).

MBS can be reached toll free 1-800-325-3252 during the following hours
(Central Time):

Monday - Thursday 7 am - 10 PM

Friday 7 am - 6 PM

Saturday 8 am  - 5 PM

Sunday  12pm - 4 PM

All foreign or APO/FPO students may want to use the MBS commercial number
which is (573) 441-9179.

Graduate students are required to purchase their books.  You may order
books from our preferred provider, MBS Direct,  by going to
http://direct.mbsbooks.com/amu.htm.  If you order your books on-line, MBS
discounts the UPS shipping charges by 20%.  You can also call MBS
toll-free at: 800-325-3252.  For more information on shipping charges to
foreign addresses, you can contact MBS at 573-446-5299.  Please know that
the standard shipping time for books is 5 business days so please remember
to order your books as soon as possible before the start of your class.

Step 3: Maintain Your Student ID and Password

Your Student ID and password are your keys to access the Electronic
Classroom.  If you have do not remember or if you have lost your Student
ID and password, please immediately send an e-mail to
techsupport@amunet.edu.

Complete these 3 steps and you'll be on your way to success.  If you have
any questions or need any assistance, please contact the registrar at
(703) 330-5398 ext 104.

Best of luck to you in your courses!

Sincerely,

AMU Office of Student Services & Technology

* if you were a student prior to February 1999, and were allowed to
continue under the old tuition rate, you must still purchase your own book
either through MBS or another book vendor as the AMU Book Grant will not
cover the cost your books."

being a crybaby.  It is tough being a baby, I think.  How did the doctor's 
app't go?  Bet you are ready for the weekend so Jim'll be around all day.  
Every working mom I know could not wait to get back to the office after 
maternity leave.  I think the daycare arrangement is generally best for 
everyone.  Baby gets a head start on her social life, and the parents can't 
wait to see the kid at the end of the work day!  Most everyone I know is 
raising their kids that way, and they seem to be turning out fine.  Even the 
handful of stay-at-home moms I've met leave their kids with someone several 
days a week, for sanity's sake.

Had lunch with Mema on Wednesday at Treebeards.  I get the impression that 
she's gotten the message that you and Jim don't exactly want her dropping in 
for spontaneous visits, so that's good.  I always enjoy meeting her for 
lunch--for some reason she's always on best behavior, and we always run into 
my coworkers and friends who just think she's the greatest.  Thank God she 
can never remember their names, or she might start calling them for lunch.  

Bill and I saw a play at Diverse Works last night called ""Fucking A.""  It was 
a take-off on The Scarlet Letter.  I thought it would be funnier but it was 
actually pretty dark.  The bearer of the letter A was an abortionist in a 
strange land working to pay her son's way out of jail.  Despite the subject 
matter it was one of the best plays I've seen in a very long time.  Diverse 
Works is an art space in the warehouse district directly north of downtown.  
(Nancy Littlejohn (Worthington) has her art gallery nearby.)  They mostly 
sponsor dance, dramatic and performance art productions.  A lot of it is 
really over the top, but I've seen some cool things there.  One of my friends 
at work is trying to get me to serve on the board of directors, so I've been 
hanging out there to see whether I like the people.  

Work is driving me nuts, but that's what they pay me for, I guess.

Time to read more FERC cases.  I don't wanna FERC, I just want to bang on the 
drum all day.

Hang in there, and please send more news of little bug!

Love,

   1. A large or high waterfall.

   2. A great downpour; a deluge.

   3. Opacity of the lens or capsule of the eye, causing impairment of
      vision or blindness.

[Middle English cataracte, from Old French, from Latin cataracta, from Greek
katarraktes, kataraktes, probably from katarassein, to dash down : kat-,
kata-, cata- + arassein, to strike.]

   ""The cataracts blow their trumpets from the steep
   No more shall grief of mine the season wrong;
   I hear the Echoes through the mountains throng,
   The Winds come to me from the fields of sleep.""
   William Wordsworth, Ode: Intimations of Immortality from Recollections of
   Early Childhood.

Have you seen the poem about a little girl who, with a lantern in her hands,
goes out in a snowstorm to light the path of her mother coming back from
town? Later, her parents go out to look for her, following her footprints in
the snow when we discover, ""And further there were none!"" My heart skipped a
beat when I came across those five words. I'm talking about Lucy Gray, a poem
by William Wordsworth ( http://www.bartleby.com/145/ww158.html ), that I read
in my early school days. Later, the emphasis on math and science, and
subsequent studies of computer science in college and grad school, blotted
out the world of poetry. I forgot the name of the poet and other details of
the poem but it has been haunting me ever since. Recently, while researching
some words, I came across the poem again and realized it had never really
left me. Does a poem ever do?

What is it in poetry that moves us so much? Perhaps it is a reminder that no
matter how tough, and worldly-wise we may or try to be, deep inside all of us
have the heart of a child. In this week's AWAD, I'll present words from some
of my favorite poets. Why don't you email me (anu@wordsmith.org ) about your
favorite poets and their poems?                                        -Anu

The first human who hurled an insult instead of a stone was the founder of
civilization. -Sigmund Freud, neurologist, founder of psychoanalysis
(1856-1939)

stuck in this shitty library desperately trying to write and research things- 
believe it or not!- i should've done 3 weeks ago.....at least i'm 
consistant.? hope all is well in houston- any news about the london thing?? i 
have a sneaking suspicion it's not going to happen- call me a cynic, but i'm 
getting bad vibes, n'est pas?? damn!? claudia is driving me nuts- and i've 
had this horrible weighty sense of deja vu- couldn't figure it out til last 
week marci mentioned something that triggered?the memory: i was, of course 
bitching about how sick i am of her badgering and lecturing me to 'party' w/ 
her at her shady discos, and marci laughingly says it's prob b/c she's 
secretly a lesbian, and is trying to hit on me.....aughhhhh1? she's kim 
barton!? although i'm not saying for sure i think kim's a lesbo (yeah, right- 
she's just nuts, at the very least....) and i k! now claudia's straight- but 
it's those boarding school kids- clingy and desperate for attention, but 
soooooo much more sophisticated and wordly than just a silly little 
conservative texas girl who has had the same friends for 15 years- basically 
just fell off the potato truck...i'm soooooo naive.? it's annoying how she 
manipultes her provenence when it's convenient- she's sooooooo texas when 
it's cute to be wholesome and outdoorsy and fun, but she'd totally 
'international' when it comes to interacting with other cultures, and how 
many 'experiences' she's had.? ohhh, she's seen fire and she's seen rain, 
alright.....just want to say to her that just b/c daddy sent her away with a 
whole bunch of other spoiled brats that never learned to socialize and behave 
properly b/c they didn't HAVE to- daddy  and 'the family' would always get 
her out of any sticky situation......maybe she's not quite as worldly and 
fabulous as she thinks.? i can not TELL you how many 'lectur! es' she's given 
me about how i'm not social enough, and if i would just let her take me under 
her wing, she could really help me grow up ( can you HEAR the 
condescention?)? i sit there and just nod dumbly, then? am fuming and it's 
all i can do to walk away w/ out slapping the haughty, self-satisfied 
expression off her face.? would like then to tell her that i've probably been 
doing more than she has been socially, but she wouldn't know b/c i'm not 
doing them w/ her...and wouldn't want to invite her along.? it would kill 
her!? she really thinks i go to the library at night, or turn my ringer off 
and read at 9:30.? bless her heart- it she weren't so pushy (my GOD- do you 
remember how bad kim was our sophmore and jr year?? constantly calling and 
putting me on guilt trips, harassing me to spend the night, and i'd have to 
finally give up, and throw her a bone and do it just to placate her?)? i'd 
just tell her i'm hanging out w/ other people! , but don't want her to go 
nuts!? well, enough venting for now....did tell her i'd be in california til 
dec 18th so she wouldn't call me- either in london or houston.? i am really 
sneaky......anyways- hope all is well- wish you were coming w/ kates- it'd be 
fun.? but- i'm sure you'll be having JUST as much fun at enron....will be 
drinking- alot- in your honor- don't worry!

we'll head over around 7:45 or so.  I will be getting some party trays, but 
unfortunately, Uncle Enron won't pay for the alcohol.   So..........bring 
alcohol and a party attitude!

I live at Providence @ Uptown.  3323 McCue Rd #1743.  This is located behind 
the Best Buy at Richmond and 610 (also across from City Streets, not that I 
ever go there!)  You will have to dial up to my apt to get in the gate.  I 
think you hit #1743 and it dials me up.  (The directions are on the keypad).  
I live on the 4th floor, but you will need to park on the roof (5).  They are 
very particular about the parking!  There are 4 hallways off the parking 
garage at each corner.  Mine would be the SE corner, anyway the apt #'s will 
start with 1600......... you're in the right place just keep going (it's not 
that far).  There is a big plant outside my door (I know you guys are amazed 
I have living plant!)  If you have any questions my number is (713) 550-8698.

day to day.
The discount letter provides that the discount applies to the one-day term 
and each consecutive one-day term (if any).  The term of the discount letter 
is typically one month or 3 months.  The discount letter does not obligate TW 
to provide service for more than one day, but as long as the term of the 
service agreement renews, the same discount would apply.  

My point is that if we are already contracting for daily firm this way, it 
should not matter whether the discount is effective for one month or for 12

   1. A woman of exemplary meekness and patience.

   2. A female given name: from a Germanic word meaning `gray battle.'

Decameron.]

   ""Whereas Rosina in `Barber' is a spitfire, all flame and sass, Cenerentola
   is a more demanding and less appealing role. She must bide her time but

,12/07/2000,,susan.scott@enron.com,bronwyn_tull@lycos.com,,Re: Hey Susan!,"Hey Bronwyn,

I just realized I never emailed you back ( I am a bad, bad person).  Glad to 
hear things are going well with you.  It was so neat to run into you in 
Houston, I see your brother around the building quite a bit but I don't think 
he recognizes me.  I'll have to make a point to reintroduce myself the next 
time I see him.  

So what's new with you?  Have you moved?  I know you were thinking about LA a 
while back...I've got a couple of friends from high school who are living out 
there and are really having a good time.  Anyway, I completely understand the 
urge to try something new.  I too am thinking of making a move before next 
summer ( I don't know exactly where, but somewhere outside of Texas...I 
really need to experience something different).  Speaking of which, Emily is 
in London going to graduate school right now.  I've already been to visit her 
once there and she's trying to talk me into moving over there.  I would 
actually love to go, if there was a job with Enron there that interested me.  

As for my dating life, it is relatively unchanged.  I was seeing one guy for 
a while, really liked him, things were going great ( I thought )...then he 
seemed to loose interest and decided 2 mos. into things to tell me he has 
issues and that he'd been married before.  Needless to say, that was pretty 
much the end of things.  It's made me a little hesitant when it comes to 
meeting new guys, but at the same time I had so much fun in the beginning 
that I'm still optimistic about my dating future.  How about you?

Concerning Kappa...I'll give you a run down on everyone I still keep in touch 
with.  Corey's in Law School at Texas ( doing great of course) and has 
already secured a clerkship with a federal judge in Galveston when she 
graduates.  Jessica Bateman is now Jessica Pulliam - and she too is in Law 
School at Texas and has secured a federal clerkship with a judge in Dallas 
when she graduates.  Elizabeth's is in Med School in San Antonio and dating a 
fellow med student there.  Stephanie Spence is now Stephanie Williams and is 
living and working in Dallas.  Lisa Meador is getting married next April to a 
guy from Texas ( he was a KA, there Brad Thealman (sp?) ) who is absolutely 
perfect for her.  That about sums it up, but if there's anyone else you're 
wondering about just ask...I can probably find out some scoop.

Talk to you soon,
Susan

1.  ""WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED"" adds a note of authority to your 
pleadings.  In fact, some administrative law judges will throw your pleading 
into the special incinerator marked ""Nonconforming Pleadings"" (located on the 
west side of the FERC building) unless such language is present.

2.  Pronouns should be used sparingly, if at all.  With few exceptions, 
parties must always be named to avoid confusion, even if it means the name of 
the party will appear several times in one sentence.

3.  The verb ""request"" may not be used without the word ""to.""  Example:  
""Pipeline X respectfully requests the Commission to grant its motion.""

4.  ""In regards to"" or ""vis-a-via"" sound more intelligent than ""about"" or 
""concerning.""

5.  If you are not sure you've conveyed an important point effectively, 
repeat the statement verbatim at various other points in your pleading for 
emphasis.  Additionally, repeating a contractual provision several times in a 
contract will give your client greater rights than if you only include the 
provision once.

6.  Always recite the entire history of the proceeding in your pleading 
before stating the purpose of your pleading.  No FERC staffer ever remembers 
what happens, and the added pages will make your pleading really impressive.

7.  When in doubt, insert more commas."

Weather Group

Let,s give a big round of applause to the Weather Team!  Environmental 
Finance Magazine ranked the weather group #1 in Online Services and #1 Dealer 
in the United States and Europe.  Gary Taylor, manager in weather trading, 
comments, ""The ""Best Dealer"" award reflects our counterparties' appreciation 
for the significant effort we have made to drive the growth of our market by 
making two-sided markets where other companies are only willing to quote 
either a bid or an offer.  This award also reflects the innovative nature of 
everyone on our desk, and their ability to price non-standard structures for 
our customers.  It is truly a team award.  The ""Best Online Dealer"" award is 
simply another testament to the unparalleled success of EnronOnline.  By 
providing tight, two-way markets online, we have provided two critical 
elements to generate growth in our market: 1) an element of price discovery, 
and 2) a quick and easy way to transact.""

The Weather Risk Management group launched a new product this week:  Power 
Demand swaps.  These contracts use power demand as an index and allow power 
market participants (generators, btu distributors, marketers, etc...) to 
mitigate volumetric exposures.  The first contract the desk offered is for 
the PJM power pool.  On EnronOnline, weekly swaps are available and the desk 
has placed option contracts on this index in the broker market.  Inquiries 
regarding this product should be directed to Claudio Ribeiro (product 
manager) x37313, Gary Taylor x31511, or Valter Stoiani x36906.

Competitive Analysis and Business Controls
eSource, Enron's premier corporate-wide research group, launched their new 
intranet product, eSearch, on December 1, 2000.  eSource's team of 
specialized researchers have created a web site to bring information and 
research to every employee's desktop.  The eSearch web site offers many links 
to information resources, access to research databases, specialized searches, 
sites to purchase books, articles, and reports, and training.  Employees can 
use the web site to conduct their own research or as a vehicle to submit 
research requests.  eSource's researchers and industry specialists are 
available to all Enron business units to provide timely and cost efficient 
research, to work with individuals or groups to fulfill one time research 
requests, or to design ongoing, customized monitoring projects or news 
updates.

Enron Global Markets Fundamentals
EGM Fundamentals is quickly building a team of expert analysts and associates 
to work directly with traders and marketers.  The team is already busy 
analyzing various commodities and market situations.  For example, an 
initiative is underway to analyze current negative fractionation spreads in 
the market resulting from rising natural gas prices.  Web sites to host this 
analytical information are currently in development for all EGM commodities.  
These sites will provide research and analysis, weather, publications, and 
any other information that will assist in decision-making or identification 
of potential commercial opportunities.  For questions or requests regarding 
fundamental research, contact Jennifer Fraser at x34759.  For questions or

Austin Energy
Austin Energy and Enron Sandhill, L.L.C, a subsidiary of Enron North America 
broke ground November 29, 2000 for the construction of the Sand Hill Energy 
Center, a 180-megawatt peaking electrical generation facility.  Located in 
eastern Travis County, the Sand Hill Energy Center will be a natural gas 
fired facility that will operate primarily during peak demand periods.  The

turbines and will be operational May 1, 2001.


NEWS FROM THE GLOBALFLASH

Coal
The London dry cargo seafreight team traded 1 million metric tonne of 
Capesize vessel swaps via EOL in one day, (Wednesday 28th November). The deal 
was created by combining OTC options and a physically related cash market 
deal.  This helps to bring our YTD EOL to just under 2.5 mln tonne.

Off-shore wind energy deal
Enron Wind has signed a power purchase agreement with Swedish energy company 
Graninge.  According to the agreement, Graninge will deliver electricity to 
consumers using Enron's wind power plants in southern Sweden.  Enron Wind's 
Utgrunden off-shore wind park, completed this year, will generate in the 
region of 38,000 megawatt hours of electricity, or enough for around 6,000 
average homes between the mainland and the island of Oland on the southeast

Happy 1st Birthday EnronOnline!
This week saw EnronOnline celebrate its first birthday.  During the course of 
its first year, EnronOnline has passed a number of milestones including the 
addition of a range of new functionalities for customers on the site.  
EnronOnline has now come of age, having surpassed the $274 billion mark in 
notional value in November.  This represents a total of 478,695 transactions 
since the site was launched on 29 November 1999.

The first anniversary was marked by giving the media guest access to 
EnronOnline in Europe.  A team from Reuters was invited into Enron House to 
receive a full demonstration of EnronOnline and as of today will be able to 
quote in reports live prices from EnronOnline.  Other media outlets are being 
invited to obtain guest access during the coming weeks as the word of 
EnronOnline's success continues to spread...

Australia
Enron Australia continues to assist in the region in a supportive role.  
Elliott Katz worked on the GEM migration in Singapore last week with an IT 
team from London, Oslo and Singapore.  Approximately 40 users, including 
Traders, were migrated to Windows 2000 and the CORP domain.  This is an 
important step for the Asia Pacific region, as it brings the three biggest 
offices (Singapore, Sydney and Tokyo) into line with corporate standards for 
desktop computing.

Japan
E-Power, a JV between Enron and Japanese finance company Orix, has announced 
proposals for a 2000MW gas-fired power plant at Mutsu-Ogawara, an industrial 
area  in northern Japan.   A feasibility study will be undertaken to define 
how the project will go forward and this may include the development of an 
LNG terminal in the vicinity.  The nature of the permitting process is such 
that the plant would not begin operations for six to seven years.  This 
project is just one of several options that E-Power are working on in Japan.

,12/04/2000,,enron.announcements@enron.com,the.mailout@enron.com,,Pulse Survey Memo from the Office of the Chairman,"In October of this year, we asked you to participate in the &Pulse8 survey.  
Over 70% of you were willing to take the time to respond.  Thank you!  This 
is our highest response to an all Enron employee survey - ever.  

In exchange for your candid feedback, we want to provide you with an overview 
of the results for our company.

We realize that you and your management have been working hard to build on 
our strengths and improve in areas of concern for us.  The results reflect 
your substantial efforts.

As you can see from the chart below, thanks to the increased focus on these 
issues provided by the Vision & Values Task Force and your efforts to improve 
communications, we have made significant progress.  

Question	1999 % Positive	2000 % Positive
Employees are encouraged to challenge the status quo	42%	47%
Decisions are communicated well	41%	50%
Employees feel free to voice opinions openly	46%	55%
Enron does a good job of acting on suggestions of employees	45%	52%
Communication across departmental lines is good	30%	34%

Congratulations on your fine efforts.  Improvements in communications across 
the company should enable better performance from all of us.  However, as you 
know, our goal is to have 60% positive in most of these areas by 2001.  So 
our work is not over and these will continue to be areas of attention. 
(Complete survey results are attached for your review.)
 
We are also pleased to report that employees across Enron expressed 
satisfaction in the following areas:
 
Employee benefits ) 82% 
Supervisors/managers deal fairly with people ) 76%
Supervisors/managers encourage teamwork ) 73%
People are treated with respect and dignity ) 73%
Information from top management is credible ) 74%
People would recommend Enron as a good place to work ) 72%
The workload is reasonable ) 67%
People are committed to Enron as more than just a place to work ) 65%

All of these areas improved between one and five percentage points since the 
previous survey.  In fact, we improved in almost every area measured by the 
core survey questions.

I am currently sitting in the Coal group's old area on 32.  While dealing 
with some computer issues Friday, I came across an expandable file full of 
Coal related documents buried beneath my desk.  The documents and contracts 
seem pretty old, which is why I assume no one has missed them.  Still, I 
wanted to contact you to see if you would like me to run them down rather 
than simply discard them.  If you could email or call me at x31455 and let me 
know what I should do with them I would appreciate it (as you know space is 
limited up here).

Services (EWS), effective today, we have reorganized the Wholesale Services 
Legal Department.

 The goals in reorganizing the department are as follows:  (i) align the 
legal department as closely as possible with the business units, (ii) speed 
the flow of legal technology across the business units, and (iii) achieve 
greater efficiency and consistency across the organization.

 To this end, a legal policy group will be formed for EWS Legal, which will 
include Lance Schuler, Enron Americas; Mark Evans, Enron Europe; Mark Taylor, 
Enron Net Works; Alan Aronowitz, Enron Global Markets; Julia Murray, Enron 
Industrial Markets; and Bruce Lundstrom, Enron Global Assets.

 The organization chart for the EWS Legal Department is attached.  More

,12/04/2000,,wsmith@wordsmith.org,linguaphile@wordsmith.org,,A.Word.A.Day--Walter Mitty,"Walter Mitty (wol-tuhr MIT-ee) noun

   An ordinary, often ineffectual person who indulges in fantastic
   daydreams of personal triumphs.

[After the main character in The Secret Life of Walter Mitty by
James Thurber.]

   ""The men you see rolling over the zoysia at 5 miles per hour are
   pretending to be Mario Andretti at Indianapolis. Nothing draws
   Walter Mitty from a soul like the sound of a riding lawn mower
   engine.""
   Rheta Grimsley Johnson, Roar of the mower helps build a woman's psyche,
   The Atlanta Journal and Constitution, May 1, 1998.

One of the most important ingredients of fiction is its characters. Think
of any memorable book, play or movie and you'll recall its people--from
protagonist (and deuteragonist and tritagonist and ...) to antagonist are
folks one can feel, relate to, though not necessarily always agree with.
These are the people with depths, they are not cardboard characters or
people who live a 2D life, to use the publishing jargon. These multifaceted
people come alive on the pages of a book, on the stage of a theater, or on
the screen of a movie theater with all their foibles, follies and victories.
Perhaps the ultimate sign of their character is that they live on on the
pages of dictionaries. This week's AWAD focuses on a few of these fictional
persons who came alive and added a bit more color to our language.     -Anu

For some reason the mail router keeps rejecting the files I'm trying to send 
you (GDOpt&Swap and PipePos).  If you have access to the rest of the system 
here you should be able to get into the PipOpt folder with out any problems.  
If you don't end up coming in tomorrow I'll get with IT and try and figure 
out a way to email you these files.  Give me a call at 713-853-1455 if you 
need anything.

I went ahead and attached a copy of your P&L from Friday if you want to take 
a look at that.  I tried calling you with the number, but I never got an 
answer.  Also, there was a confirm that came in for you Friday with Amerex:

   1. A possession unwanted by the owner but difficult to dispose of.

   2. A possession entailing great expense out of proportion to its
      usefulness or value to the owner.

   3. An abnormally whitish or pale elephant, usually found in Thailand;
      an albino elephant.

[From the perhaps apocryphal tale that the King of Siam would award a
disagreeable courtier a white elephant, the upkeep of which would ruin the
courtier.]

   ""Now an orchestra opening a new hall has reason to pray, solemnly and at
   length, that it will not be saddled with a white elephant with mediocre
   acoustics.""

   The New York Times, Sep 30, 2000.

and I
went home for Thanksgiving.  It was our first time back home since the 
wedding.
It was kinda strange because since we live nearby each other, we had to decide
whos house we were going to stay at and when.  Oh the joys of being married 
and
having to split your time between the families!  It was good to see his mom
because we hadn't seen her since she started her chemo treatments.  She's 
doing
well - she's pretty much lost all of her hair, but she is now getting some of
her strength back.  She goes back to Houston next week for her fourth 
treatment
and they'll do a sonogram to see how the tumor is doing.  She will most likely
have a mastectomy in the next few months, and then we'll just go from there.
We also drove up to Austin last Thursday night for the game of Friday - GO
HORNS!!  What a fun game that was!  I had been debating on whether or not I 
was
going to go because I had surgery the Thursday before (tonsillectomy - YUK!!)
It was hard to not be able to scream after we scored touchdown after 
touchdown!!
I saw a lot of our pledge sisters at the game - Lindsay, Erica, Stacey, etc. I
was kinda out of it, though, because I was on a lot of pain medication, so 
they
probably thought I was nuts!
Anyway, I just wanted to make sure I have all of your correct addresses.  
Corey

you've moved, so can you just email me your address again?

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

EGM Coal & Emissions
The November and December NYMEX market remains very tight.  Offers in the OTC 
market have climbed to the low $40s.  The highest reported trade for December 
was reported at $38.50.   The tightness should continue through the first 
half of the year  with the Martin County mine still shut down.  The rest of 
the year remains strong piggy backing off of the current spot market. 

Finally--Life beyond the 150 to 155 range--vintage year 2000 SO2 allowances 
broke out of this trading range this week.  The low trade was around $119.50 
and the last trade was around $120.50.  The sharp drop in prices was caused 
in large part by the news of Dominion Virginia Power settling the New Source 
Review lawsuit brought against it by the state of NY and the EPA Continuing 
rumors of further NSR related settlements will likely create continued 
volatility.  It is as yet unclear what the new price floor will be.

NOx has settled down a bit with last trade 2001 vintage of $675.

Principal Investments
Solo Energy Corporation, an Alameda, California based developer of Wireless 
Energy microturbine products to supply superior on-site energy service to 
U.S. commercial and light industrial customers, announced that Enron North 
America has completed an equity investment in Solo Energy as well as entered 
into an alliance agreement.

In exchange for warrants to purchase the Company,s preferred stock, Enron 
will assist in obtaining fuel contracts to support the Company,s distributed 
generation contracts, including the provision of gas and backup electricity, 
and will work with the Company to support its market and gas technology 
research. 

NEWS FROM THE GLOBALFLASH

EnronCredit.com
On Halloween, Enron Credit.com hit the City of London last Tuesday. As an 
original PR stunt, the EnronCredit.com team organized a Grim Reaper with two 
female vampires to distribute candy carrying the message, ""Corporate 
bankruptcies are on the increase and could be your worst nightmare. You can 
protect your company and sleep well at night"". Locations for the distribution 
of 5,000 packs of candy were Bank, Broadgate and Canary Wharf. The general 
feedback and reaction of people was positive. Photos of the event will be 
available on the EnronCredit.com site.

Enron Japan Corp.
Enron is powering ahead in Japan following the official launch of Enron Japan 
Corp. in Tokyo last week.  In keeping with Japanese tradition, Ken Lay, Joe 
Hirl, Ken Rice and Mike McConnell donned ""happi coats"" - a sort of short 
kimono - and used ceremonial hammers to break the lid of a wooden cask of 
sake in front of an audience of 350 drawn from major companies and 
government.  Enron has made an immediate impact already by offering eligible 
consumers 3-5 year contracts with immediate savings of up to 10 percent in 
the first year.   View the Japan website at www.enron.co.jp  [No worries, 
it's in Japanese and English ...Ed]

There are 35 Enron employees in the Tokyo office including an Enron Metals 
team.  EBS will be staffing up there over the coming months.  


Nordic energy agreement with UPM-Kymmene
Enron Nordic Energy and UPM-Kymmene Corp. have signed a two-year portfolio 
management agreement covering UPM Kymmene's Nordic power portfolio. The 
Mid-Market desk in the Oslo office will assist UPM in optimising its 
portfolio of approximately 14 TWh. energydesk.com will provide UPM with the 
risk management system used in the process. In addition, the agreement opens 
the door for Enron Energy Services to explore a variety of opportunities 
within the company. The Nordic agreement is the first step towards a broader 
scope of co-operation with UPM on a European and Global basis. The total 
contract value is estimated to be $375 million.

UPM-Kymmene's nominal electricity resources total about 3000 MW, of which 
2500 MW in Finland and about 500 MW in other countries. The group's power 
procurement totals approximately 18 TWh per year, of which about 14 TWh in 
Finland. Around 15 TWh/a is consumed by the group's own mills and the rest is 
sold to the market.

http://www.upm-kymmene.com
http://www.upm-kymmene.com/upm/energy/energybuild.html

The deal was led by Sami Tenngren - Nordic Mid-Market, and was supported by 
Magnus Groth - EES, Jukka Hormaluoma - energydesk.com, and Martin Rosell - 
Legal.

Congratulations on a job well done to all those who worked so hard to put 
this transaction into place........Thor Lien.

Australia
Despite heavy flooding in NSW, the weather is looking up for Enron 
Australia.  Last week, the Sydney Office launched online Hong Kong weather 
derivatives  and the Sydney weather node traded on EnronOnline in the US time 
zone.  With this precedent, we hope to support the takeoff of global weather 
on EnronOnline.  

The Coal Group in Sydney has suddenly become very popular. There is no doubt 
that a recent sale to AES for the plant at Barbers Point, Hawaii is the real 
reason.  Coal purchases during year 2000 have been concluded with most major 
producers in Indonesia and Australia.  We will soon be loading our first 
shipment from China. Deliveries to Nippon Steel in Japan are underway. Also, 
a shipment to a large power utility in Japan will take place in early 2001.

Off-shore wind plans
Enron has entered into agreement to purchase the development assets of a 30 
MW offshore wind project in the UK.  The Harwich project, situated in 
Gunfleet Sands approximately eight kilometres offshore in the North Thames 
Estuary is believed to represent one of the first serious investments in the 
development of offshore wind energy in the UK.

""The name of Enron may be unfamiliar in Japan, but it should not stay that 
way for long.........Joseph Hirl, president of Enron Japan, says: ""We don't 
go in and try to destroy markets - we go in and create them.""  Some of the

,03/21/2000,,susan.scott@enron.com,mary.miller@enron.com,,daily firm on TW,"The Commercial Group asked several weeks ago whether they can enter into 
discount letters applicable to daily firm for as long as one year.  The 
standard wording of the discount letter applicable to daily firm is such that 
the discount is effective for as many one-day terms as the FTS-1 agreement 
renews, but not beyond a specified date.  Typically TW enters into these 
discount letters for a term of one month.  The marketers say that they were 
once told that they could not make such a discount applicable for longer than 
a 3-month term.   I see no basis for this limitation.  The term of the FTS-1 
agreement is one day, renewable from day to day.  The discount is only 
applicable for so long as the FTS-1 agreement renews.  If the FTS-1 agreement 
does not renew, the discount is no longer applicable.  The basis for the 
shipper's transportation rights is the FTS-1 agreement.  We are not 
guaranteeing a shipper ""daily"" firm for longer than a one-day term.  The 
discount letter merely states that, for so long as the FTS-1 agreement 
renews, a particular discount applies, up to a certain cutoff date.
Does this make sense?  I realize you are swamped, but I need to get Steve an 
answer so that the marketers know what is acceptable.  Drew and I have 
discussed this and he is on board. Thanks."

Doug has been on my computer for the past two days finishing his thesis, so
I haven't been able to write back.

Well-- if nothing else, at least you can practice your witty repartee with
him.  Did he write back?  That non-conference opponent excuse was lame.
Exactly who were the non-conference opponents--Rice, SMU, Slippery Rock...
Hmmm.  We need a little more information to give that credibility.

I have been studying like a nerd lately, so hopefully, finals won't be so
stressful this year.  I keep remebering that we gave that shower right
before my finals last semester.  That comforts me-- I know wasn't prepared
for any of them at that time and class had already ended.

Anyway, I just had a 15 minute conversation with the Time Warner Cable guy--
I called to pay my bill because I lost the paper copy-- first, he looked at
my address, saw it was near Hyde Park Bar and Grill-- and preceded to
disucss all of the wonderful menu items-- french fries, Reuben sandwich,
iced tea-- then I gave him my credit card number and he asked me if it was a
USAA card-- apparently you can tell by the first 4 digits-- 5416-- who knew?
  We talked about how great USAA is for 5 minutes.  Then he asked me if I
was in school in Austin-- so we talked about that...  When he finally
finsihed with me, I thought he was going to ask me out.  If it weren't for
Doug, I would have gone- he was quite a nice guy.

Anyway, it was refreshing considering how many idiots, jerks, assholes, etc.
work in the service industry.

Well, let me know what's going on.

Talk to you later."

I'm totally open to whatever works best for you, truly.? That would be fun to 
have all day Saturday, and I'm really not worried about leaving you a key 
under the door mat or waking up to greet you- we can work it out.? Whenever 
you want to leave on Sunday is fine with me, too.? I'm not doing much to help 
you make a decision, I know, but I want you to do whatever is easiest and 
most comfortable for you.? I remember you having to get up at the crack of 
smack to come out here on Saturday; sometimes it's easiest to stay up later 
rather than getting up earlier!? I have virtually no plans that weekend now, 
so I'll start thinking about what fun events are occurring that weekend....We 
should go out downtown to the Gaslamp quarter, too, since we didn't get to do 
that last time.? We'll plan on Saturday evening for that.? I'll gather some 
friends....

Hope you're having a good day!

,03/23/2000,,susan.scott@enron.com,gerald.nemec@enron.com,,Re: FERC Issues,"Gerald -- here are a couple of suggested wording changes (should appear in 
blue)

 1.  FERC was made aware of the Compression Services arrangement with ECS (at 
that time via Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.) in the filings for the 
certification of the Kachina units.  FERC simply didn't ask any further 
questions in that proceeding.  The Operation & Maintenance Agreements in 
place for the Kachina units essentially accomplishes the same things as the 
Operational Control Agreement in Gallup.  TW feels the O&M agreements would 
be adequate to address any concerns about TW's regulatory responsibility over 
the compressor facilities.  The Operational Control agreement was put into 
place in Gallup because it was thought to be easier to give FERC exactly what 
is was looking for rather than show them the Gallup O&M Agreement which might 
unnecessarily complicate the process at that time.

 2.  There is no basis in FERC Regs or the NGA for FERC to impose any type of 
penalty or discontinue the Compression Service's due to TW's operation of 
Kachina without the Operational Control Agreement.  No regs or law address 
this situation.  Again this is tempered by the fact that FERC was made aware 
of the arrangement and didn't ask any questions and the O&M agreement is in 
place to accomplish control for TW.

 3.  I also faxed you a copy of Section 19(c) of the NGA which indicates that 
the petition for rehearing does not effect the status of the certificate.  
Construction is moving ahead and the anticipated start date is May 1.  

I will forward the filing TW made wrt to the Operational Control Agreement as 
soon as I recieve it.  Let me know if you have any further questions (713)

loss to your alma mater, as well as an unbelievably beautiful victory over 
Nebraska) always managing to stick it out no matter how bleak things got.  
Speaking of which it must sting being beat by the last place team in your 
conference...but I'm sure the Pac-10's record against non-conference 
opponents is really helping to ease that blow.  Speaking of feather's in the 
conference cap, looks like our next national champion is going to be from the 
Big 12 - will wonders never cease.

My Monday is going great, thank you very much and I will show extreme 
restraint and refrain from any Chips comments ( Besides, I don't have time to 
type that much ).  UCLA could stand a chance next year if the NFL doesn't 
prove too tempting to some of your vets...how does that saying go,  ""Like

the Pac-10 had the best record against non-conference opponents.  UCLA will 
dominate next year and Texas will be forced to play second fiddle to the

right.  With an increasingly more confident sophomore quarterback leading the

to make big plays, not to mention last year's top quarterback recruit Chance

,11/27/2000,,wsmith@wordsmith.org,linguaphile@wordsmith.org,,A.Word.A.Day--albatross,"albatross (AL-buh-tros) noun, plural albatross or albatrosses

   1. Any of several large, web-footed birds constituting the family
      Diomedeidae, chiefly of the oceans of the Southern Hemisphere, and
      having a hooked beak and long, narrow wings.

   2. A constant, worrisome burden. An obstacle to success.

[Probably alteration (influenced by Latin albus, white), of alcatras,
pelican, from Portuguese, or Spanish alcatraz, from Arabic al-gattas : al,
the + gattas, white-tailed sea eagle. Sense 2, after the albatross in The
Rime of the Ancient Mariner by Samuel Taylor Coleridge, which the mariner
killed and had to wear around his neck as a penance.]

   ""Getting the albatross that is Temelin off its neck would make the
   utility more attractive to future investors.""
   Tony Wesolowsky, Fueling up fast, Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists,
   Sep/Oct 2000.

  Water, water, every where,
  Nor any drop to drink.

Ever wondered where these well-known lines came from? They are from a work
that is the origin of the figurative use of today's word: The Rime of the
Ancient Mariner, a poem by English poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge, first
published in 1798.

In this vivid poem, a mariner and his crew are traveling in a ship near the
South Pole. For no reason, the mariner kills an albatross flying above his
vessel.

   'God save thee, ancient Mariner!
   From the fiends, that plague thee thus!--
   Why look'st thou so?'--'With my cross-bow
   I shot the Albatross.'

His shooting down of the innocent bird brings a curse to the ship, and his
shipmates throw the carcass of the dead bird around his neck, thus giving
a powerful idiom to the English language.

   Ah! well a-day! what evil looks
   Had I from old and young!
   Instead of the cross, the Albatross
   About my neck was hung.

Much happens in the rest of the poem and the whole crew, except the mariner,
dies. As a penance, the wizened mariner wanders, recounting his tale and
wisdom.

   He prayeth best, who loveth best
   All things both great and small;
   For the dear God who loveth us,
   He made and loveth all.

this is an issue about which I do not wish there to be any uncertainty.
With regard to a customer's use of on-system storage, whether the gas is
delivered on system or off system upon withdrawal, there should be no
additional ""storage charge"" as mentioned in Craig's note.  What I understood
was that any deliveries to on system delivery points of gas withdrawn from
SoCalGas storage or any other on system storage provider (when there is one)
would not involve a double transportation fee.  In other words, as happens
today, there would be a tranport charge on injection, and a regular full
tranport fee paid by the customer on withdrawal and delivery to the on
system burner tip, BUT WITH A FULL CREDIT FOR THE INJECTION TRANSPORTATION
CHARGE, so that only one net transport charge is made.  Please confirm that
this is the result in such an example.

With regard to the delivery of storage gas on withdrawal to an off system
delivery point, I do not see any rationale for imposing a second transport
fee, or failing to offer the same credit as it offered for on system
delliveries from storage.  This would seem to be particularly true as Lad
indicated that such deliveries would be accomplished by displacement, and
would be subject to operational restrictions so that they would only be
accomodated when SoCalGas had sufficient flow through the interconnect to
make the displacement work.  Please explain the rationale, if any, for the
imposition of an entirely separate transmission charge in this circumstance.

Thank you, Mike Day"

,11/21/2000,,enron.announcements@enron.com,all.downtown@enron.com,,Holiday Safety Reminder,"HOLIDAY SAFETY REMINDER

The holiday season can mean an increased risk of fires and a higher potential 
for criminal activity due to people taking advantage of convenient downtown 
shopping and because of the increased number of special events and office 
parties.  We would like to pass along a few safety and security tips from the 
City of Houston Fire Department and the Houston Police Department.

? Please do not prop open stairwell doors or doors to the freight elevators.  
This defeats security. 

? Use only artificial trees and greenery in decorating your office space. Do 
not place cut trees or greenery within the building. Cut trees become major 
fire hazards when they dry out.

? Office parties or the holiday mood may distract you.  Be alert for thieves 
who try to take advantage of the holiday season. Sometimes just having fewer 
people at work during the holidays creates an opening for thieves. If you see 
someone that does not appear to belong in your work area, immediately call 
the Enron Security Console at 713-853-5360.

? Keep your purse or wallet with you at all times or locked away in a drawer 
or closet.

? If you go shopping, invite a friend to go along. Try not to overload 
yourself with packages.  When you return, lock your gifts away in a safe 
place.

? Always be aware of your surroundings while in a public area. If things don,
t look right, follow your instincts and avoid going into the area.

? When waiting for a ride home after hours, remain inside the building near a 
card-reader door until you see your ride arrive. 

? If office parties are on company premises and involve alcoholic beverages 
or public invitees, call security at 713-853-5360.  Security will advise you 
as to company guidelines."

somewhat random, but I just found some great airfares from Houston to San

Did I mention Wilson?  Coming back to Houston--never for any length given his 
love for NYC.
Yup, 6 weeks.  Mixed b/c everytime I get dug in, I get moved.  Actually, I am 
establishing a 
London base now and am happy with that but my project is on hold and I am a 
bit anxious.
The Kiwi girl sits next to me and has to commute from what seems like N 
Africa to get to work
so she is sick of the commute.  Well, that's all for now.  I will see you

,03/31/2000,,susan.scott@enron.com,camp2scott@aol.com,,Re: ballpark,"Hi Mum!  No, tickets were hard to come by.  Tried to get some they released a 
couple of weeks ago, but didn't realize everyone would send their secretaries 
and interns downstairs to hold places in line!  I'm sure the VPs will get 
tired of going to the games, and start giving tickets away. 

Tonight is the big CAM gala.  Bill was in trial all week and had no time to 
go shopping, or even to get measured for an ordinary tux rental, so he 
borrowed one from Andre (who owns 4).  Andre is a couple of inches shorter 
than Bill.  Depending on the overall look, I may or may not acknowledge that 
Bill is my date.  My 60's dress I got at Wear It Again Sam looks fabulous.  
It is a sleeveless gown with an empire waist; the top is maroon velvet and 
the rest is very heavy pink satin.  Since it wraps in the back I was able to 
move the hooks over to get it to fit.  Dress was $38 but it cost $35 to get 
it hemmed!  Ann and I were considering asking Mema to do our hair, but I'm 
really going to be pressed for time this afternoon.  Too bad the party is not 
on a Saturday.

Our plans for the rest of this weekend are still up in the air.  What are you 
doing the weekend of the 16th?  Bill has signed up for the MS150 again that 
weekend.  If you are free that weekend why don't I plan to come either Fri. 
or Sat. a.m.  Let me know.

Our law conference begins Thurs. a.m. in San Antonio.  Dot (Staci's boss) is 
having a party at her house on Lake McQueeney on Wednesday, so I'm driving 
Frazier and Tony in the Dentmobile that morning.  We really do have a fun 
group; it should be a good time.  If K&J want company I'll drive over to see 
them on Thurs. night instead of going to the awards dinner, which was a big 
drag last year.  I'll call them this weekend and see what Jim's travel plans 
are.

Today we'll find out about settlement in the California proceeding...this 
will decide whether I will be tied up in hearings for most of May.  Keep your 
fingers crossed!

Love,
Sooz

,11/20/2000,,susan.scott@enron.com,darren.maloney@enron.com,,Re: Hello from Soon to be Houston,"Hey Darren,

It's funny you mentioned Wilson because I just got an email from him this 
morning.  He seems to think he'll be in Houston in the near future as well.  
Hopefully, we can all get together and go out or hit steak night for some 
cold ones.  So H-town for six weeks hugh?  Why the mixed feelings?  Are they 
work related or were you just starting to get settled in London?  Anyway, 
I'll have to give Nick a call about the big news...I may have an idea what 
it's all about but then again maybe not.  So what's with this Kiwi girl?  
Because, I actually have made some progress regarding London.  Turns out 
there may be some structuring and originating opportunities for me over there 
which would be much more in line with where I'd like my ""career"" to be going 
versus the other opportunities I was being offered.  Either way, I won't be 
going over until March or April of next year so it's still a ways off.

As for the guy scene...yes, there has been some courting but nothing really 
to speak of.  I've gone out on a couple of dates but I can't say I really see 
them going anywhere.  Most of the guys around my age are still pretty 
insecure and I'm never going to be the kind of girl that wants to ""shape and 
mold them"" into men...I just don't have the patience or the inclination.  And 
the other end of the spectrum (single guys in their late 30's/early 40's) who 
seem to hover around like gnats just give me the creeps.  Oh well, as I've 
said before ""hope springs eternal"".

Talk to you soon,
Susan

fun then me....NOT!

I'm glade to hear that you are well. 
it's nice to know, and nice to hear that work is going well...and don't worry 
about treating the male gender like shit. I myself i'm going to through a 
total...freaking out stage....i've hocked up more then 18 times in the past 
month...different girls. (no sex)
Just keeping ,myself bsuy while my borken heart and soul is trying find

So i take it your busy...

I had another big week end myself
Restaurant opening ""sushi Samba"" free food, free drinks and hot girls. 
NICE....then on to a Model agency party. ""Icon""..NICE...but a little weak on 
the patying side.
So on to Syrene...partied there until 6:30 am..NICE""
dancing, getting naked...mostly undressed :)
making out with girls.. (juliette, Jeanie, Linda, kristy and my favorite 
right now Niki!) DId I mention that Jeanie and Linda are sweedish, and 
lesbians!

A good nigh followed by a relaxing saturday. Brunch, shopping, work out, 
dinner with Alison and Jeanie at ""Cantine"" and on to a house party. great 
time there.
Lots of hot girls..and good music. good people...a good time...Yes there also 
I made out with girls. I've gotten quite good at it! hi hi...
gils of the night: Jeanie, Gretchen, Linda....
Then on to Syrene...but i did not like the crowd so i was back home early at 
3:30am...

Sunday was another relaxing day.
Shopping, and work out, then met up my friends for some partying at 
""Felix""...then dad invited me for dinner and back out at ""Boom"" for some 
brazilian live music and some hot girls...yes dancing and more dancing...and 
also some stripping.

So i got one more big night of partying before i get over to france.
I'll let you know when i come to houston and we will defently have a drink.

Hope your well. 
Be good and have a great thanksgiving.
take care

,11/20/2000,,susan.scott@enron.com,wilson.kriegel@enron.com,,"Re: Coming to Houston, soon","Hey Wilson,

Yep, I'm still in Houston for the time being...I'll probably be here through 
March of next year when my current rotation ends.  Everything's going pretty 
well, work is still consisting of long hours but I think ultimately the hard 
work is going to pay off.  In fact, the whole London thing is looking pretty 
good right now.  There might be an opportunity for me to get into some 
structuring and originating roles over there which is much more along the 
lines of where I'd like to go (versus this whole trader support thing - great 
experience for the time being, but definitely not a permanent role).  Glad to 
hear things are still well with you.  Sounds like you're still the same old 
Wilson...working deals and hooking-up.  You'll have to let me know when 
you're going to be in town so we can get the gang together to go out.  It 
looks like Darren's going to be back in town for about 6 weeks or so coming 
up so hopefully we could all make a steak night reunion.  

I've been going out quite a bit as well and have had a couple dates, but 
nothing really to speak of.  I was kind of on a rampage over the last month 
just messing with guys heads (flirting, getting them to buy me drinks, giving 
them my number and then completely ignoring them).  I think it was some need 
I had to treat your entire gender like shit.  I'm pretty much over it 
though.  It's not really in my nature to be like that, just a reactionary 
thing for having been treated like crap myself.  

Keep in touch and let me know when you're going to be in town.

Susan

December and If you were up to it, I thought it'd be a good weekend trip for 
you, Katy, myself and whomever else may want to tag along (especially since 
it doesn't look like we'll be making it to Gruene over New Years).  Plus, if

When we face a serious crisis we often look upwards for divine intervention.
In such hopeless times we pray to the gods to descend from heaven and
deliver us from whatever travail prevails. In ancient Greek and Roman drama,
the gods literally came down from above, though not from heaven, to help the
heros of the drama and save the plot.

As it turns out, the gods themselves needed a little bit of help coming
down. A crane was used to lower a god onto the stage and untangle the plot.
Thus he was known as deus ex machina, literally, a god from a machine. Soon
the figurative use of this device in a drama began to be described by the
same name. Greek dramatist Euripides (480-406 BC) was particularly fond
of it. We are all intimately familiar with this device thanks to popular
cinema. The hero who had supposedly drowned half-way through the story is
miraculously revived to accompany the heroine into the sunset.

This week we look at more words from the world of literature.       -Anu

California Edison complaint alleging that SoCalGas had abused its market 
power in the secondary release market for pipeline capacity.  The Commission 
had decided that SoCal's compliance with the maximum tariff rate made any 
inquiry into such issues unnecessary and dismissed the complaint.  The Court 
concluded that the Commission's refusal to examine the market power issues 
raised by Edison was arbitrary and capricious, in view of the CPUC approved

difference between the price it paid for contracted interstate capacity and 
the price it received for release of any such capacity.  On March 30, 2000,

It is that time of year when everything gets SO crazy, so I am

we need to plan our Taster's Finale ahead of time so we can all mark our
calendars and so we can find a place!

Here are some thoughts:  we could do a boy/girl Taster's where we all invite
some of our friends, guys and girls to join us and we rent out a room at a
restaurant.  Or we could have just girls and have a really nice Christmas
celebration at a cool restaurant and do ""Secret Santa"".  Either way, it would 
be
a blast.

How does Thursday, Dec 14th sound?

So, here is what I need:  your vote on............... the type of party, then
what restaurant that goes with that idea, then affirmation of the date.

Get excited girls!  This is going to be fun!

,01/01/1980,,susan.scott@enron.com,,,,"Koch Gateway has a provision in the Negotiated Rates section of its tariff 
that allows Koch to charge a lump-sum option fee.  Neither the tariff nor the 
FERC order approving the provision describes the option fee in much detail.  
The Commission did require Koch to separately state any option fee 
arrangements when making its negotiated rate filings for deals that include 
option fees.  The Commission also stressed that an option fee annot guarantee 
capacity and therefore does not amount to a request for transportation 
service.

Koch has made three negotiated rate filings involving option fees.  In the 
first such filing, Koch explained that the proposed negotiated rates were 
comprised of two parts:  an option fee and an index-based usage rates.  
Because Koch did not specify the index price formula, the Commission required 
Koch to provide this information.  The Commission also required Koch to 
report the time frame during which the negotiated rate customers could 
exercise their options, so that other shippers could determine whether they

Enron to the list of parties at the end of the document.  I recommend TW do 
the same.  I propose that we ask Brian to add TW to the list, with a footnote 
that we support the transmission proposal only and do not oppose the other 
parts of the term sheet.  (I propose this out of an abundance of caution 
because in one part of the document Brian states the parties have agreed on 
comprehensive settlement, but later in the document he states that the 
parties aren't fully committed yet.)  If he will not agree to do this, then I 
would suggest we leave TW off the list and file a letter with the CPUC along 
the lines of what I circulated yesterday, with additional language supporting 
the motion for extension of time.  Let me know what you think."

Enron Building, Houston leased offices, and Two Pacific Place (Omaha) will be 
transitioning from Corporate to Enron Energy Services (EES) by year-end.  The 
areas affected include facility operations and maintenance of mechanical, 
electrical, and air-conditioning systems; mail delivery;  housekeeping;  
food, copier, and records services.

This transition of services, as presently managed by Enron Property and 
Services Corp. (EPSC), is designed to optimize value to Enron,s Business 
Units by leveraging facility management businesses now offered by EES to 
their commercial customers.  EPSC staff having administrative responsibility 
for these services will report to Enron Facility Services, a subsidiary of 
EES,s Global Energy Services group led by Daniel Leff, President and CEO.

EPSC is responsible for Enron,s internal real estate and office development 
needs, including leasing, space allocations and facility planning, project 
and construction management, furniture systems, and office relocation.  EPSC, 
in its development role, remains a part of Enron Corporate Administration 
Services (ECAS) along with Corporate Security and the Aviation Department, 
reporting to Bill Donovan, Vice President, Corporate Administrative Services.

This alignment of responsibilities offers the opportunity for EPSC to focus 
resources on effective utilization of our existing office space assets and

bridesmaid's luncheon.  I was thinking a good time would be Friday for a late
lunch (around 1:00).  That would be late enough for morning flights to arrive
and still give us enough time for the rehersal dinner.  But, I want to make 
sure
this fits with your schedules because we can always have it on Saturday.  On
Saturday I had planned for us to go get our nails done and hair (optional) but
we can flip flop the days if some of you will not be able to get off on 
Friday,

So, let me know what you think and what your schedule allows!

around the world, over 425 nominations were received representing a broad 
cross-section of our overall organization and resulting in a 73% increase in 
nomination participation from last year.  This 100% employee-driven program 
is so successful because you take time to nominate and recognize those 
individuals that are special in your work life.  Every single candidate is to 
be congratulated!  

This year, the original concept was brought to fruition when the members of 
the 1999 Chairman's Roundtable took over the selection process and carried 
the torch from past to present.  This Selection Committee reviewed all 
candidates on the basis of their ability to consistently bring our values to 
life and sought out those select few that are Enron's ""everyday heroes"".  

It is with great pleasure that we announce the 2000 Chairman's Roundtable 
whose daily pursuit of excellence, commitment to communication, genuine 
integrity and respect for others are what make Enron the incredible company 
that it is today - innovative, successful and undoubtedly one of the best 
places to work.  The eleven individuals named below are flying to San Antonio 
this from around the world to be honored at our annual Management 
Conference.  One of these finalist will receive the distinguished recognition 
as the actual Chairman's Award winner:

THE 2000 CHAIRMAN'S ROUNDTABLE

Amelia Alder, Enron Operations Services (ETS) - Houston, Texas
Dan Boyle, Enron Global Finance - Houston, Texas

Attached is a list of every employee who was nominated for the Chairman's 
Award this year:



Please take a moment to recognize this honor bestowed upon your fellow 
employees.  We sincerely thank them for their contributions to Enron and 
their leadership that helps make this organization the world,s leading energy 
and communications company.   If you have any questions regarding this year's 
program or suggestions for the future, please contact Charla Reese at

   The Enlightenment.

[German : auf, up (from Middle High German uf, from Old High German.) +
Klarung, a making clear, from klaren, to make clear, from Middle High German
klaeren, from klar, clear, from Latin clarus.]

   ""The idea that a profanity, especially one that was used as more than a
   casual expletive, could be used as a - pardon - legitimate verb was to me
   something of an Aufklarung, an enlightenment.""
   Jon Hahn, A Deposit From Mr. Ed Pays Garden Dividends, Seattle Post -
   Intelligencer, Oct 26, 1999.

If memory serves me right, Caesar described the Germanii as a large, hardy,
ferocious people who inhabited the gloomy forests to the east of Gaul, wore
hardly any clothes and were perpetually on the move. Well, if he were able to
have a look around the seashores of Spain, Portugal or Italy today, he might
say exactly the same thing, although this time around the context would be
rather more peaceable. The descendents of those redoubtable forest-dwelling
savages are probably the world's number-one travelers today, still gripped by
an extraordinary wanderlust that sends them to the four corners of the earth
in apparent flight from the serious, orderly and slightly boring society they
have constructed for themselves in their geopolitical sandwich between the
Latins to the west and the Slavs to the east. The Germans have done a lot of
fighting and a lot of thinking about that sandwich over the centuries since
Caesar reported on them, and the words that have entered the English language
from their experience frequently reflect those military and intellectual
struggles: they are light on things like play, gastronomy, fashion and
frivolity but top heavy in philosophy, political thought and struggle in
general: serious, consequential stuff. If these words tend to be a little
ponderous and hard to pronounce, they are marvelously apt expressions of what
could never be expressed so well if our English tongue just minded its own
business and never wandered abroad to steal from others.         -Rudolph

Dear Sir or Madam :

 Enron Corp. (&Enron8) believes in conducting its business affairs in 
accordance with the highest ethical standards.  Accordingly, employees of 
Enron and its subsidiaries are required to comply with Enron's Business 
Ethics Policy which requires an employee to conduct himself/herself in a 
manner which is not detrimental to the best interests of Enron and which does 
not bring to the employee financial gain separately derived as a direct 
consequence of his/her employment with Enron.  Further, Enron's Business 
Ethics Policy states that no lavish entertainment or gifts are to be given or 
received by Enron employees for special position, price, or privilege.

 Not only is it incumbent upon our employees to follow this policy, but your 
cooperation in respecting these standards is also critical.  Enron expects 
each of its vendors and contractors to maintain adequate records that 
document its work relationship with Enron.  Enron's auditing department will 
routinely conduct business ethics compliance audits of certain vendors and 
contractors with whom Enron does business.  Your recognition of our ethical 
standards allows Enron employees to work with you via arm's length 
transactions and avoids potentially embarrassing and unethical situations.  
If you ever become aware of variances from our policy, please advise:

filed, there is no telling what the CPUC will do.  My recommendation is that 
we play it safe and assume we will need to file testimony on April 17.  To 
that end, it's time to review some basics.

In its July 8, 1999 decision, the Commission stated:  ""We see reason to 
pursue a change in protocol for receiving gas at Hector Road, even in the 
short term.  If there are burdens that would unfairly fall upon Transwestern 
customers is a window was established at Hector Road, we want to hear about 
it in the next phase of the proceeding.  In addition, we seek specific 
proposals as to how such an arrangement should be defined.""

Accordingly, the testimony we file should explain:

1.  The unfair harm that could potentially befall TW customers if Hector Road 
were established as a formal receipt point
2.   Our proposal for making Hector a formal receipt point by establishing 
primary and secondary receipt points
3.  Why our proposal is fair and consistent with Commission policy (here we 
might want to draw analogies to the interstate system and explain why that 
works)

I will also have an opportunity to make legal and policy arguments in a brief 
after testimony has been filed.

Let's discuss how best to go about drafting the testimony.  I think the best 
thing to do would be to outline the testimony, then decide who is going to 
say what.  I'm available after about 2:00 today."

http://travelocity1.m0.net/m/s.asp?H2490447302X903685

Maui
Hawaii's year-round warmth makes it ideal to visit any time of 
year--it's the dreariness in the rest of the United States that makes 
it especially attractive in the winter. That means you'll hardly be 
the only visitor escaping the snow, but the island's languid 
tropical pace makes crowds manageable. While on Maui, be sure to 
visit the beaches on the western side. But don't stop there. The 
eastern half of Maui is an unspoiled, uncrowded natural paradise, 
where time flows at its own pace, and natural wonders such as the 
Haleakala volcano are easily accessible. 
Maui: http://travelocity1.m0.net/m/s.asp?H2490447302X903686
Eastern Half: http://travelocity1.m0.net/m/s.asp?H2490447302X903687

Mexico
An easy trip from much of the United States, Mexico is a great place 
to get away from it all, especially when the winter winds start 
howling up north. Whether your pleasure is tanning, fishing, diving, 
or driving (it's easier than you think to bring a car into the 
country), Mexico's got it all.

Sydney
Want to escape winter for real? Then head down under, where summer 
is getting going as the first chill gusts of winter blow through the 
northern hemisphere. Sydney's an exciting place to visit any time. 
And with Olympic tourists long gone, and the weather getting 
beautiful, now's a great time to discover the opera house, 
picturesque harbor, world-famous Bondi Beach, and more. 
http://travelocity1.m0.net/m/s.asp?H2490447302X903708

Bangkok
For a really different winter getaway, try a winter vacation in 
exotic Bangkok. With average daily temperatures approaching a high of 
90 degrees F in the winter, it's sure to be hot enough for you. This 
ancient and modern city features a grand old palace and high-rise 
office buildings, temples and shopping malls, canals and freeways. 
You'll find the best of the old and new worlds in Bangkok, all coming

cold. Miami is another perennially sunny destination; one where 
you're sure to come back with a tan that's the envy of all. But

thriving Cuban-American community, the classy Deco District, and 
excellent nightlife and dining.

***TRAVEL TIP***

What to Pack
As most seasoned travelers are all too aware, the Golden Rule of 
traveling is to pack lightly. It may be tempting to pack for every 
contingency by stuffing the entire contents of your closet into your 
suitcase, but it's hardly smart. See our packing tips for help.

confident that, once we are past the first day of the month, the gas daily

the valuation from 10/31.  Is there anyway to see same breakdown on 11/2 and 
11/3 for 10/31's position.  If you could send me that information in the same

of last week then I understand if you want to call it off.  In that case
maybe we can meet up some other time.  Although I do remember a girl telling

You'll be happy to know that I think I finally caught up on all of the sleep 
I've been missing out on of late.  Last week was extremely trying at work, I 
think I probably put in a good 70-75 hrs. between Monday and Friday, and thus 
resulted in me being a complete and total vegetable this weekend.  Anyway, 
I'm assuming you've been trying to relax as well and have some fun before 
embarking on your new career with Valero.  I'm sure your decision to leave 
Enron and move back to San Antonio will prove to be the right one.    

In regards to dinner this Friday...I would definitely like to get together 
before you leave.  Given how I've been feeling on Friday evenings as of late 
(monumentally exhausted), sometime earlier in the week might be better.  
However, if Friday's the only time you can do it then Friday it is.  Just let 
me know what works for you.  Of course, regardless of what night it is, it's 
probably going to have to be on the later side to accommodate Larry's lackey 
(i.e. me).

I'm sorry I never got in touch with you last weekend, but I had the wrong 
phone number with me and didn't have enough brain power to think of using 
Information.  I don't think I would have been much fun anyway since I pretty 
much just ended up sleeping the whole weekend.  In fact, I fell asleep in the 
car on the ride back to my sister's house after the game and my parents 
decided to just leave me in the car.  I think I was probably out there for an 
hour before I woke up (needless to say I was very confused).  Anyway, hope 
things are going well for you and Clay.  I know everything must be kind of 
crazy for both of you right now with finals coming up and all of the 
interviewing you've both no doubt been doing. 

I really want to get a chance to see you and chat...I don't feel like we've 
had a good one in forever.  I will be in Austin over Thanksgiving for the 
game, so we could try to touch base then if you're going to be in town.  If 
not, I'm sure I can manage at least one weekend trip during December if 
there's a good weekend for you.  Just drop me  a line when you get a chance 
and let me know what's new with you.

Eleven Proven Ways to Get Along Better With EVERYONE

1.  Before you say anything to anyone, ask yourself 3 things:
    1.  Is it true?
    2.  Is it kind?
    3.  Is it necessary?

2.  Make promises sparingly and keep them faithfully.

3.  Never miss the opportunity to compliment or say something encouraging
to
someone.

4.  Refuse to talk negatively about others; don't gossip and don't
listen to gossip.

5.  Have a forgiving view of people.  Believe that most people are doing
the
best they can.

6.  Keep an open mind; discuss, but don't argue.  (It is possible to
disagree without being disagreeable.)

7.  Forget about counting to 10.  Count to 1,000 before doing or saying
anything that could make matters worse.

8.  Let your virtues speak for themselves.

9.  If someone criticizes you, see if there is any TRUTH to what he is
saying; if so, make changes.  If there is no truth to the criticism, ignore
it and live so that no one will believe the negative remark.

10.  Cultivate your sense of humor; laughter is the shortest distance
between two people.

11.  Do not seek so much to be consoled, as to console; do not seek so much
to be understood, as to understand; do not seek so much to be loved as to
love.

Hope things are well with you.  I talked to Darren last week and it sounds as 
though he is extremely busy these days.  I'm guessing the story's much the 
same with you - a far cry from the listless days you two spent in Net Works.  
Anyway, if you could let me know about the detailing I would appreciate it.

Susan

By the way, since there's no telling if I'll have the opportunity to gloat 
two weeks from now (Tech in Lubbock is never a safe bet) - and while neither 
season has been one for the record books (except of course for our loss to OU 
- one of the worst in history) - I noticed that unlike the Longhorns, your 
beloved Bruins are conspicuously absent from the top 25.  Oh well, c'est la 
vie."

,10/30/2000,,kyle_etter@hotmail.com,susan.m.scott@enron.com,,,"Hey, how was the weekend?  Did you at least catch up a little on your rest?
You had one heck of a week but then again I guess that is just old hat for
you.  We had a good time on Saturday.  It is always fun to be on sixth
street close to halloween, even more freaks come out.

OK enough stalling.  I just thought something needed to be said about
wednesday.  We could just go on and act like nothing happened and probably
never see or talk to one another ever again.  I don't like that solution.
My personality is to go with the flow but by doing this you sometimes miss
out on opportunities.  So the traditional me would say it was just one night
and didn't really mean anything, which could possibly be true.  One thing
that I learned from you is that you have to take chances and don't be
intimidated.  You have a very strong personality and I can see where
somebody could easily be intimidated.  Along with that comes someone who is
smart, attractive, outgoing, and somebody who can fit in anywhere, whether
your at the local honky-tonk or at some gala.  The one thing I know about
you is that your going to be successful and I don't mean in the monetary way
because I know that isn't high on the priority list.  I also know that if I
would have never left the company then I probably wouldn't be sitting here
writing this email.

When I was thinking about leaving I didn't think it was going to be that
hard.  I really didn't like the way my life was going and I knew I needed a
change.  Then I sit back and think of all the things I'm going to miss.
People bad talk risk all the time, with the long hours and little respect
you sometimes get it is understandable.  The thing I'm going to miss the
most are all the friendships I have built working in that group.  Sometimes
the toughest times are when you really get to know someone.  But the hardest
thing now is that I will not be around you.  I know that sounds really bad
but the honest truth is I have liked you ever since we started sitting next
to each other.  We had this chemistry and it made the job a little easier
knowing you were there.  I really think the best times I had in Houston were
those couple of weeks we went out after work to have a few drinks.  I also
knew that since we worked together that it probably wasn't the best thing to
get involved.  I really regret that decision right about now.

Alright I guess I have said a lot of sappy stuff and you should know that
I'm not usually like this, which is probably why I didn't call you to share
this info.  I do think some things need to be said or else the other person
will never know.  You are a great person and even though the chips are
stacked against me I needed to let you know this.  I understand that your
under a lot of stress right now and by no means do I want to add on.  The
one thing I wish you would take away from this is that if your 35 and still
looking then you need not look any further.

So I apologize for using this forum to express this I really wanted to talk
to you in person on Friday but I just didn't get a chance much less know
where to start. I hope we stay in touch and if you ever want to go to Gruene
Hall then let me know.  I also don't want to be put in one of your stalker
categories so take this for whatever you want, please don't think of me as
the next SP.

Take care and have a good week.

Kyle

least it is number one in my book."

out a bit more here in Houston during the week in an effort to become social 
again.  There isn't too much new in Tejas...the weather's still warm and a

Today is Wednesday, so of course Steak Night is on the agenda for this

Enron and his happy hour just happens to be at Little Woodrow's tonight - how 
convenient.  On the man front, I've put myself back out on the ""market"" so to 
speak and have a couple of pursuant suitors right now (although, I don't know 
that in the end any of them will pass muster).  Unfortunately for them I am 
somewhat sceptical of guys in general these days (especially ones that I

let that color my opinion too much.  Not to worry about your former neighbor

Analysts in conjuction with the Wesley Community Center's ""Adopt-A-Family"" or 
""Angel Tree"" program. The Wesley Community Center is affiliated with St. 
Luke's Methodist Church that has been in operation for 20 years and has 
supported this program for 12 years. Many of you may have been involved with 
similar programs previously in school or through other organizations. The 
Wesley Community Center provides us with the details of each family that the 
Enron Elves will adopt. We will then form different teams, each of which 
adopts one family. The teams raise or donate money for the families to buy 
Christmas gifts and food vouchers. As a bonus, Enron will match all funds 
that we raise and donate them to the Wesley Community Center. Just before 
Christmas, the teams get together for a wrapping party that is sponsored by 
the Elves and the AA Program that is always a fun and festive time.

David Guillaume and Katie Stowers are coordinating this year's program and we 
need lots of volunteers to be team leaders and members. Team leaders are 
needed to staff teams in conjunction with David and Katie. Leaders will 
essentially coordinate the fund raising/donating, present buying, wrapping, 
and delivery for their team. I was a team leader last year, and it was an 
easy, fun, and  very rewarding job. We need lots of volunteers to make 
Christmas very special this year for needy families in the Houston area!

If you would like to be a part of this rewarding program, please email David 
or Katie by Friday, October 27th. Please indicate in your response if you are 
interested in being a team leader. If you have any questions at all regarding 
this program, please give David (3 - 5034) or Katie (3 - 3339) a call. Thanks

With the wide and varied activities of our three organizations, we created 
this e-mail newsletter to keep everyone better informed about our various 
businesses.  I hope you find it informative and more importantly, that you 
will use this newsletter to help spread the word about the successes in your 
group.

To provide content for future e-mails, contact Michelle Vitrella in our 
Public Relations group via e-mail or call her at ext. 3-9767.  Communication 
is one of the core Enron values and I believe this is a great way to improve 
communication across our wholesale businesses.

Additionally, I would like to again encourage everyone to take a few minutes 
to complete &The Pulse8 survey.  This annual survey regarding the work 
experience at Enron and how we can make it better is an important part of the 
two-way communication process at Enron.  Please go to the Enron intranet and 
type survey.enron.com.  It only takes a few minutes, it,s confidential and

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

Natural Gas
Middle Marketing,s biggest trade of the year so far occurred this month.  The 
significant transaction was a five year, multimillion dollar restructuring 
with a subsidiary of Formosa Plastics, one of the world,s largest producers 
of polyvinyl chloride.

Additionally, Continental Airlines, the fifth largest US carrier, has hedged 
a considerable amount (1.2 million barrels/month) of crude oil.   Winter 
Nymex hedges were put in place for the undisputed heavyweight chip champ of 
the world, Frito Lay.

Pulp & Paper
With the acquisition of Garden State Paper and launch of Clickpaper.com, 
Enron is creating an efficient spot physical market for pulp and paper 
commodities.  Buyers and sellers will benefit from improved price 
transparency and reliability and access to Enron,s online financial markets.

Improved price transparency and the ability to imbed financial derivatives 
into physical trading flows will facilitate the growth of Enron,s trading 
business.  To date, Clickpaper.com has traded over 1 millions tons of pulp 
and paper product with a notional value of over $675 million.

Upstream Origination
Upstream Origination, headed by Julie Gomez and Jean Mrha, focuses on natural 
gas products to optimize commercial value associated with the natural gas 
grid on the continent and in the Gulf of Mexico (GOM).  Through products such 
as storage, electric compression and producer services & outsourcing, ENA 
creates value for its customers and reconfigures the natural gas 
infrastructure to be more efficient.  In addition, Upstream Origination 
transactions exploit the unique relationship between development of strategic 
assets through sophisticated financing structures and the utilization of the 
market information created by those assets.

A popular motivational saying goes, ""Desserts is stressed spelled backwards.""
This is an example of a reversible word, which when read from the right
yields another word. All of this week's words exhibit this quality. Just like
reversible clothing that changes pattern when worn inside out, reversible
words result in other usable words. A special case of reversible words are
palindromes, which spell the same when reversed. So palindromes are a subset
of reversible words which in turn are a subset of anagrams. Another name for
reversible words is semordnilap, a self-referential word coined by reversing
the word palindromes.

Some words coined in this manner have actually entered the dictionary. Here
are two examples: YOB (a rowdy youth), coined by reversing BOY, and MHO
(former unit of conductance), coined by reversing OHM, the unit of electrical
resistance.

Taking inspiration from the above desserts/stressed saying, can you coin a
pithy aphorism using some word and its semordnilap? Don your wordsmith hats
and send your gems to anu@wordsmith.org. Original entries only, please. I'll
publish selected ones here in a compilation next week. Here is a helpful
hint: you can elicit semordnilapic quality in many words by forming their
plural, past tense, etc. Also, semordnilaps are especially useful in creating
longer palindromic words. Here is a simple example, ""Devil Dennis sinned,
lived."" Can you come up with something more interesting? Email them to the
above address.                                                      -Anu

worrying and thinking of me that I care nothing for...I've got another guy 
who I at one time cared for but no longer do trying to take advantage of my 
vulnerable state (which in truth isn't really vulnerable at all) and another 
guy, who I until fairly recently cared for, who I think could go the rest of

,10/13/2000,,wsmith@wordsmith.org,linguaphile@wordsmith.org,,A.Word.A.Day--syzygy,"syzygy (SIZ-uh-jee) noun

   1. Astronomy. Either of two points in the orbit of a celestial body where
      the body is in opposition to or in conjunction with the sun. Either of
      two points in the orbit of the moon when the moon lies in a straight
      line with the sun and Earth. The configuration of the sun, the moon,
      and Earth lying in a straight line.

   2. The combining of two feet into a single metrical unit in classical
      prosody.

[Late Latin syzygia, from Greek suzugia, union, from suzugos, paired : sun-,
syn- + zugon, yoke.]

Ambigram: http://wordsmith.org/words/syzygy.gif

SYZYGY
This curious word comes from the Greek language, where it meant the yoking
of two oxen. Over the eons, it came to mean the joining of any two entities
without losing the individual characteristics of either one. This idea brings
the yin/yang symbol to mind, and also the ambigrammatic phenomenon of two
letters being joined into one shape without loss of their readability. In
astronomy, however, ""syzygy"" is defined as an alignment of three heavenly
bodies in the solar system, more like the periodic alignment of the three Ys 
in
the word. How could a word that once implied the pairing of two entities come
to refer to the alignment of three?

        The answer comes in the fact that in science, no phenomenon can be
investigated without taking into account the presence of the investigator.
And when two heavenly bodies are seen to be in alignment, they are being
seen from a third, which is necessarily in the same straight line. So
no matter which way you look at the syzygy ambigram, it satisfies both sides
of its ambiguous definition.

,10/12/2000,,susan.scott@enron.com,julieg@qualcomm.com,,Howdy,"Hey Julie,

I just got back from London Tuesday and am now almost fully recovered from 
the jet lag.  I had an absolutely incredible time while I was over there and 
was even able to go into the Enron office for a while.  One of the guys I 
knew here in Houston even set up an impromptu interview for me while I was 
there so I think my working over there may be a very real possibility.  Since 
I'd already done a lot of the touristy things the last time I was in London 
Emily and I pretty much just hung out.  We went out to eat Friday night and 
then to a club ( I think we got home around 4 am after indulging in some fish 
and chips).  Saturday and Sunday we mostly just wondered around the city to 
various shops and markets and went out to various lunch and dinner venues.  
Finally, on Monday I went in to the office while Em was at school and then 
had a fairly big last night in town with some friends of Emily's.  Hope 
everything's been going well with you and that the move into your new place 
was a success.  I'll keep checking for great fares out to SD...I'd love to 
meet your roommate and all of your other friends I feel as though I know now.

ENERGY
        Philosophers search for truth in much the same way that artists
do. They don't really expect to find any definite answers. They mainly want
to provide and investigate more ways of looking at the world. But scientists
differ slightly. Science strives to provide very definite, measurable and
provable truths. In the back of their minds though, scientists understand that
those truths are only temporary, and that they may very well be replaced
someday by another truth. So they're really not so different from artists
and philosophers after all.

        Einstein's Theory of Relativity has been accepted as a scientific
truth. But it has so far not been found to mesh with quantum physics. It
may very well be that the 21st century will modify one or both of those
truths as well. So for the time being, we can look at energy as mass times
the speed of light times the speed of light. From another point of view,
energy is the capability of a body to do work or produce an effect. It's
possible that the second definition will outlast the first.

Ambigram: http://wordsmith.org/words/philosophy.gif

PHILOSOPHY
        My fondness for ambiguity in language and its graphic
representation hurtles me headlong into the hallways of heady philosophy.
Like ambiguity, philosophy tends to scare a lot of people, and it does so
for the same reason. Maintaining a single point of view on an issue is
often the easiest path, but it is not consistent with a philosophical
spirit. After all, ""philosophy"" is derived from Greek words meaning, ""the
love of wisdom"" not ""stubborn entrenchment."" In fact, if one loves wisdom
and searches after truth, then one is required to look at things from more
than one point of view.

[From Latin ambiguus, uncertain, from ambigere, to go about : ambi-, around +

Ambigram: http://wordsmith.org/words/ambiguity.gif

AMBIGUITY
        Ambiguity is one of a handful of English words whose meaning
describes itself. In other words, ""Ambiguity"" is ambiguous. It refers, on
the one hand, to a situation of imprecision, of obscurity, because more
than one interpretation is possible. On the other hand, something ambiguous
can be understood perfectly well - but from more than one point of view.
        We are amused at the fable of the elephant and the six blind men,
each of whom understood the elephant to be a very different animal. But we
seem to lose that good-natured perspective just in time to assume that our
own point of view on the world is more accurate than that of many of the
other human beings on the planet. We avoid ambiguity as much as possible,
feeling threatened that it may expose our own point of view as merely an
option.
        But we should embrace ambiguity. After all, each of our eyes sees a
slightly different, two-dimensional, view of reality. Those two images are
synthesized by the brain into a single three-dimensional image, which we
think of as ""more real"" than a 2-D view. The more points of view we are able
to see, the more clearly we understand the world around us. Reality is
ambiguous. Ambiguity is synthesis.
        I like to think that looking at everything - not only words -
from alternate points of view, can enhance our understanding of the world
around us.

AMBIGRAMS
Ambigrams are words that can be read from more than one point of view.
I have been creating ambigrams as visual meditations on language--as
commercial graphics and as fine art pieces--for almost thirty years.
Anu has invited me to share my unique point of view on language with
his A.Word.A.Day audience. I certainly appreciate this opportunity. I
hope you will enjoy looking at words in this new way and find it both
entertaining and thought-provoking.

Each day this week, your AWAD regular mail will consist of an ambigram, a
paragraph or so about a particular word, exploring some unorthodox points
of view regarding its meaning.  As it really makes more sense to view the
ambigram first, and in a format that allows you to invert it, I suggest
that you print it out, so you can enjoy its symmetry and reversibility
before and while you read.          -John Langdon (langdojw@drexel.edu)

Five or seven messages in a week? That was a close poll. We received 4112
votes for five compared to 4049 for seven. This is your list and accordingly,
beginning with next week AWAD will go out five days a week.

Thanks to everyone for taking the time to voice your opinion. Your love and
concern shows--a good number of people sent their votes for five to indicate
that we, the people at Wordsmith, should take some time off.

Here are some selections from the comments that came with the ballots.
(Ballot, from Italian ballotta, a small ball used to register a vote.
So for this poll, maybe I should call these emailots).          -Anu

   If you go to five, you'll have to change the name of this valuable
   mailing to FWAW. Scott Murphree-Roberts

   I'd vote with the Beatles - eight days a week! Please don't stop AWAD at
   weekends! Barbara Cooper, Rome, Italy

   With so many words to learn, we need at least seven days a week.
   Helen Slade

   Oh, Like I'd Just Stop BREATHING on Weekends?
   More work for you, more fun for me. Seems like a no-brainer to me!
   Thanks for the great service! Hampton G. Miller

   In the Middle East, Thursday and Friday are the weekend. Here in New
   Zealand, our Monday is your (North American) Sunday. The ""weekend""
   therefore stretches from Thursday to Monday. Seen from a global
   perspective (which is the only reasonable view to take on a language as
   ubiquitous as English) the issue is therefore meaningless. Regards,
   Philip Gould

   I like 7. I enjoy the email, and use it to verify that my email is up and
   running. Audrey Calvo

   If, like the gallant little tailor, you're up to seven at a blow, so am I!
   Heartfelt thanks for 'A word a day' and AWADtalk -- the highlights of my
   day! Cheers, Paulb

   Take a break on weekends! Give me time to absorb all the wonderful new
   words you have sent during the week! Maddytg

   Take the weekend off. Although I will miss the extra two entries, I'd
   rather see you conserve your efforts. I would hate to see this wonderful
   service burn out because of fatigue. Jane Dinielli

   Have weekends free. I think AWAD is great, but I also think you deserve
   time off. I hope enough others agree! Art Funkhouser, Bern, Switzerland

   I say take a break but I really love your programme - even if it does
   spell the American way, eh? Rod Dawson, Canada

   I love wordsmith. I feel smarter, look smarter. But I want to be dumb on
   weekends and find that I don't pay attention as much. Please don't think
   that we don't love you as much as ever just because we want slightly less
   of you. Janice Heilmann

,10/05/2000,,office.chairman@enron.com,clickathome.mailout@enron.com,,A Computer and Internet Connection for You and Your Family,"As you know, technology is critical to Enron; it drives our success and will 
continue to do so in the future. Technology has helped Enron create new 
businesses like Enron Broadband Services and Enron Net Works, and it is 
responsible for applications such as EnronOnline and EnronCredit.com.  You,ve 
seen what technology can do at work.  Now we want you and your family to 
realize its benefits at home.

With that in mind, we are excited to let you know that we are introducing the 
ClickAtHome
program, which will give each employee a computer for use at home. Where 
technology permits, we will also subsidize an Internet connection. With the 
click of a mouse, a home computer plus Internet access will put a world of 
Internet knowledge at your family,s fingertips.  

We have just signed an agreement with Dell Computer Corporation to provide 
the computer hardware. We wanted to let you know about the program now in 
case you and your family were considering the purchase or upgrade of a home 
computer or Internet connection in the next few months. The scope of 
ClickAtHome includes the following:

? Basic package: Dell desktop computer with a high-speed processor, floppy 
disk drive, mouse, speakers, monitor, modem, CD-ROM drive and Windows 2000 
software. Employees will have the option to receive a subsidized Internet 
connection, including broadband, where commercially available.
? Participation: This program will be available to active regular full-time 
and regular part-time employees of Enron and its wholly owned subsidiaries; 
however, employees of some Enron companies (Portland General Electric, EOTT, 
Enron Facility Services) may not be able to participate due to legal, 
accounting, tax, labor or business reasons.  Eligibility includes being 
employed at the time of implementation.  
? Timing: U.S. employee sign-up will begin in early 2001, with delivery of 
the equipment and Internet connection to follow shortly thereafter.  Delivery 
of equipment to participating non-U.S. employees is targeted for late 2001.

Details about this program are still being finalized.  To address some of 
your initial questions, we,ve posted a question-and-answer document on 
http://clickathome.enron.com.  We will schedule an eSpeak session in the near 
future where you will have an opportunity to ask questions. Or, you can 
submit your questions and comments to ClickAtHome@enron.com. 

We are excited to extend our investment in technology to you and your 
family.  We believe this program takes communication at Enron to a new level 
by creating endless possibilities for you to experience and participate in 
the broadband Internet revolution. It is just another reason why we believe 
Enron is a great place to work."

,10/03/2000,,susan.scott@enron.com,tobin.carlson@enron.com,,Re:,"Hey,

Thanks for the well wishes.  I don't actually leave until Thursday, but I am 
VERY ready and equally excited.  I ended up meeting Ted for dinner Thursday 
to ""chat"".  He definitely doesn't deserve the title of Wonder Boy.  Anyway, 
I'll forward you the email I sent Emily regarding the evening in question.  
Hope everything's good with you.

Well, we met and had dinner last night.  NOTHING of importance was discussed 
during our entire meal and it was only when I brought things up as we were 
leaving that any actual talking occurred.  Here are the basics...

- There is definitely no ""us"" anymore...and I quote ""sometimes these things 
just fade out""
- There is much I didn't know about him and I am sure even more that I still 
don't
- Case in point...He was MARRIED before (yes, you read correctly married)
- Turns out he's been divorced about three years, it didn't end well and he 
hasn't had a relationship that has lasted beyond       2 mos. in those three 
years (even though, by his own admission, he has dated a lot) - Can you say 
issues?
- He told me ""I know this sounds so trite, but this really has nothing to do 
with you, it's all me.""  Of course I agreed with him saying ""I know it's you 
Ted, I don't have any problems."" (He got a chuckle out of that one)
- I told him about my frustrations and disappointment with how he had handled 
things and he apologised (evidently Kevin told him about our exchange at 
Steak Night) and I also let him know how much I appreciated his handling of 
things in the beginning
- I said I really hated animosity and hard feelings and that as long as he 
hadn't done anything truly horrible to me (i.e. murder a family member, etc.) 
I would really like to leave things on a good note...He agreed.
- He said I was a fantastic girl and that he still enjoyed hanging out and 
talking with me (although I don't see us doing a lot of that)

So all in all I walked away with three very important things 1. A lightened 
load (I got everything of my chest that I wanted to and needed to) 2. My 
dignity (I handled it just as I'd hoped...with composure and wit) 3. A 
clearer since of Ted as a person (He definitely has a lot of issues in his 
life he has not completely dealt with yet, and who knows if he ever will?)

Anyway, I'm okay with everything and surprisingly feel pretty good.  I'll 
talk to you soon.

Susan

By the way, I told him about the shirt idea (he thought it was funny, and 
maybe just a little harsh)"

to hurt you. So in like manner you must grow in patience when you meet with

Big Boy's Adventures in Thailand

With his checkered overalls, cowlick curl and penchant for double-burgers, 
Big Boy seemed an unlikely fit for Bangkok.

""People thought he was a little, well, creepy,"" says Peter Smythe, the head 
franchiser for Big Boy restaurants in Thailand, dusting off his giant Big Boy 
statue on Bangkok's main thoroughfare.  ""They kept asking me, 'Is he a 
Chinese Ronald McDonald?'""  Eventually, a few Thai visitors decided Big Boy 
was a religious icon and laid bowls of rice and incense at his feet.

Kathy was getting her certification for spinning classes and thus I was given 
the responsibility of baby-sitting Corey and Travis.  Anyway, Trav's pledge 
class had a reunion at the house after the game and I think it may have 
single-handedly cured me of wanting men in their early thirties.  The single 
guys from their class are definitely still single for a reason.  Also, you've 
gotta tell Chuck that Kinzer's date for the game was a year younger than me 
(although I will say, after meeting her, you would've thought she was much 
younger).  I think 27-28 may be a better range.  Old enough to know who they 
are and what they want, but still young enough to explain their unattached

It's 8:30 and I'm still at work.  Did I mention I really need this vacation?  
Anyway, I have a couple of questions for you.  Is there anything special 
you'd like me to bring over (that your Mom isn't getting for you).  I talked 
to your Mom yesterday and she mentioned a craving for Turkey Jerky.  If you 
want me to bring some over just let me know where to buy it.  Also, do you 
have any predictions for the weather.  I'm planning on bringing the following 
- jeans, sweatshirt, black pants & skirt, black cardigan, ""rain coat"" (I put 
it in quotes b/c I know mine won't be official), some ""go out"" close, running 
shoes, heels, and boots, 2 sweaters, varying tops, and a pair of shorts.  I 
always end up over-packing, but I'm really going to try to pare down.  I'm 
assuming you have a blow-dryer so I can leave mine at home. 

I talked to Darren today and he said Friday sounded good...and, I sent an 
email to Nick so hopefully it will work for him as well.  I also emailed 
Jessica's friend Ashley who's living over there and she wanted to get 
together maybe for lunch or something over the weekend. 

I've been checking out the Tube Maps on the Web and don't think I should have 
much of a problem getting to your place.  I assume I'm going to want to get 
off at the Holland Park tube stop.  Should be a piece of cake, right?

Any bright ideas of how to get your extra set of keys to me Friday morning?  
I guess there isn't really anywhere for you to hide them around your flat 
(i.e. under the doormat or over the door frame?).  

See you soon,

,10/02/2000,,susan.scott@enron.com,jkbowles@hotmail.com,,RE: original tasters gathering!!,"Everything goes O.K.  I met with Ted last week for dinner Thursday night...it 
was VERY enlightening.  I'll forward you the email I sent to my sister-in-law 
(it sums everything up pretty well).  Let me know if you want to grab coffee, 
a drink, etc. tonight or tomorrow night - although I think you've got NCL 
tomorrow.  

Well, we met and had dinner last night.  NOTHING of importance was discussed 
during our entire meal and it was only when I brought things up as we were 
leaving that any actual ""talking"" occurred.  Here are the basics...

- There is definitely no ""us"" anymore...and I quote ""sometimes these things 
just fade out""
- There is much I didn't know about him and I am sure even more that I still 
don't
- Case in point...He was MARRIED before (yes, you read correctly married)
- Turns out he's been divorced about three years, it didn't end well and he 
hasn't had a relationship that has lasted beyond       2 mos. in those three 
years (even though, by his own admission, he has dated quite a bit) - Can you 
say issues?
- He told me ""I know this sounds so trite, but this really has nothing to do 
with you, it's all me.""  Of course I agreed with him saying ""I know it's you 
Ted, I don't have any problems."" (He got a chuckle out of that one)
- I told him about my frustrations and disappointment with how he had handled 
things and he apologised (evidently Kevin told him about our exchange at 
Steak Night) and I also let him know how much I appreciated his handling of 
things in the beginning
- I said I really hated animosity and hard feelings and that as long as he 
hadn't done anything truly horrible to me (i.e. murder a family member, etc.) 
I would really like to leave things on a good note...He agreed.
- He said I was a fantastic girl and that he still really enjoyed hanging out 
and talking with me (although I don't see us doing a lot of that...not very 
healthy for me) 

So all in all I walked away with three very important things 1. A lightened 
load (I got everything of my chest that I wanted to and needed to) 2. My 
dignity (I handled just it as I'd hoped...with composure and wit) 3. A 
clearer since of Ted as a person (He definitely has a lot of issues in his 
life that he has not completely dealt with yet, and might never deal with 
completely)

Anyway, I'm okay with everything and surprisingly feel pretty good.  I'll 
talk to you soon.

maybe just a little harsh)

[Sanskrit ahimsa : a-, not + himsa, injury (from himsati, he injures).]

   ""As my conception of Ahimsa went on maturing, I became more vigilant
   about my thought and speech. The lines in the Anthem:
       Scatter her enemies
       And make them fall;
       Confound their policies,
       Frustrate their knavish tricks

Today is October 2, the day Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi was born in the year
1869. A man born some two centuries ago may appear irrelevant to our age,
but in reality his life and message are still applicable to our lives today.
As opposed to being a tale of great achievements, as most autobiographies
are, his `Story of My Experiments With Truth' is a collection of
introspections and experiences in his search for truth. ""Let us not reduce
the standards of truth even by a hair's breadth for judging erring mortals
like myself,"" he writes in the introduction.

years (even though, by his own admission, he has dated a lot) - Can you say 
issues?
- He told me ""I know this sounds so trite, but this really has nothing to do 
with you, it's all me.""  Of course I agreed with him saying ""I know it's you 
Ted, I don't have any problems."" (He got a chuckle out of that one)
- I told him about my frustrations and disappointment with how he had handled 
things and he apologised (evidently Kevin told him about our exchange at 
Steak Night) and I also let him know how much I appreciated his handling of 
things in the beginning
- I said I really hated animosity and hard feelings and that as long as he 
hadn't done anything truly horrible to me (i.e. murder a family member, etc.) 
I would really like to leave things on a good note...He agreed.
- He said I was a fantastic girl and that he still enjoyed hanging out and 
talking with me (although I don't see us doing a lot of that)

So all in all I walked away with three very important things 1. A lightened 
load (I got everything of my chest that I wanted to and needed to) 2. My 
dignity (I handled it just as I'd hoped...with composure and wit) 3. A 
clearer since of Ted as a person (He definitely has a lot of issues in his 
life he has not completely dealt with yet, and who knows if he ever will?)

Anyway, I'm okay with everything and surprisingly feel pretty good.  I'll 
talk to you soon.

                   For September 25-October 1: Instead of wishing
                   things were different, or woefully mourning the
                   past, build a new beginning. It's pointless to
                   bemoan recent changes or languish over
                   disappointments. You cannot change the past.
                   You cannot change people's minds, either. Face
                   your situation and create something wonderful.
                   The longer you fuss about what 'should have
                   been', the more likely it is that important
                   opportunities will drift by unnoticed. Cancer, it is
                   time for change. Release frustrations and
                   troubling memories. Move on, Crab. . . move
                   on. 


Mine for today

   Quickly get past a troubling misunderstanding
   Once you've released toxic feelings,
                   the atmosphere visibly improves, much to your
                   pleasure. You're able to replace fear and
                   resentment with compassion and
                   understanding. Once you know the score, you
                   no longer feel threatened or disrespected. Keep
                   revenge out of this entire episode. 'Teaching
                   someone a lesson' is not appropriate."

too much he can do to talk his way completely out of
it.  I just don't like the fact that he has been such
a weirdo lately.  It sounds like he just may have a
flaw of some type.  I guess if he had a serious
girlfriend come back into his life or something, maybe
that would explaing things.  Otherwise, if he was
goint through some type of other trauma, you would
think he would share it with you.  I can't wait to
find out how it goes.  Molina's sounds great, what a
place to make a tense situation more relaxed.  The
phone call is a must, I wouldn't answer any more e
mails from him (ever!).

About Korea...I'm glad you are still coming over.  It
will be fine that you are coming with your parents.
We'll just drag them along with whatever we want to
do.  I don't recall them ever slowing us down before!

Have fun in London.  Do you have any Enron interviews
scheduled?  I'm sure you and Emily are going to have a
lot of fun.  I hope you like the London office.  I
guess you may have heard our latest.  We filed all of
the paperwork electronically for our follow-on
assignment after Korea.  We ranked Germany, Hawaii,
Savannah, Ft. Bragg (NC) and Ft. Campbell (KY) in that
order.  The guys e mailed us back and said he wouldn't
be able to get us Europe or Hawaii and that Savannah
is ""overstrength"" and that he would probably need us
at Campbell.  Needless to say, we are both furious
about getting our last choice.  Not necessarily with
the base, but with our lack of selection.  Ft.
Campbell wouldn't have even been in our list if it
wasn't the only place left where Chinooks go.  It
really ticks me off that hard work just doesn't pay
off in the Army.  We didn't get an option coming out
of Korea, we got an assignment.  What's the incentive
to do your job well, and most importantly, what is the
incentive to stay in.  I'm so mad that we don't have
any say in our next assignment and that Chuck could
likely get Korea again after that.  Gotta love the
Army.

It's not a done deal, I've got to get Chuck fired up a
little to fight this whole thing.  The guy said he'd
get back to us in a few weeks and let us know for
sure.  I hope we can beat him with a response and at
least try and negotiate with him.  We may even extend
6 months in Korea if it will make a difference.

Ft. Campbell is an hour outside of Nashville, TN.  I
think there are nice areas to live in closer to
Nashville.  Maybe we could live halfway in between and
I could work in Nashville and Chuck could commute a
little to work.  I just hate the idea of living in
another small town for another 2-3 years.  Enterprise
was enough.  We'll keep you posted.  Maybe it will
work out for the best anyway.  Maybe this is how Chuck
is going to get his big fixed wing break.

Let me know how the whole Ted thing goes, and we'll
start planning for your visit.

So, of course, I spent this whole past weekend trying to figure out how I 
want to handle this ""situation"".  Basically I've decided the following:
 1.  I will agree to meet him for a beer and a chat (I'm going to suggest 
Molina's - I think it's a good location, public enough & private enough)
 2.  I will be calling and leaving a message with him to let him know I will 
meet with him, NO email... and will request that he do me the same courtesy.
 3.  I will let him do the talking (I mean he's the one that wants to have a 
chat so he must have something to say)...at least to begin with
 4.  I will NOT be a push-over 

Well, what do you think?  Any suggestions/recommendations?  I am very new to 
this whole relationship discussion thing.  More importantly, do you think 
there is ANYTHING he could say/do that would or should allow him a second 
chance?  Right now I don't know if there is, but unlike you (and you know 
this about me) I do believe in second chances.  That does not mean that a 
second chance is a given in this situation.  Get back to me when you get a 
chance.

- - I just know I would always regret not meeting with him Em.  This is a 
chance for me to prove that I can handle myself with maturity and dignity

outcome, it will make me a stronger person.  By the way,  we will definitely 
cover the past relationships during this chat, that is a given.

""I'll FedEx you these documents today!"" You have most likely heard people
say this when what they really mean is they will send the material by a
courier service, not necessarily the FedEx company. How many times have you
xeroxed documents without even checking whether the copier was made by the
Xerox company as it churned out the copies? Today I'm discussing a phenomenon
called genericide whereby a trademark becomes so popular that it is used as
a generic for the entire product category, not just as a specific brand name.

The success of a brand name is often a double-edged sword for the owning
company. Initially, a company's dream is to become so successful with its
product that customers use their brandname as a generic, ""Need to ship your
documents overnight? Just FedEx them!"" As the brand becomes more popular,
they struggle to protect it lest it gets watered down and becomes a generic--
a victim of its own success. Did you know the words adrenaline, aspirin,
celluloid, escalator, gramophone, granola, heroin, kerosene were all
trademarks once owned by companies? This week, AWAD will feature examples
of words that, once trademarks, now are dictionary entries: bona fide words

[From Greek palillogia recapitulation, equivalent to palin again, back +

   repetition of words and grammatical presentations, a sort of parallelism
   in threes.""

- utter disappointment.  But yes, it is definitely his loss.  And, I loved 
the fact that Kevin (his friend) spent so much time talking to my Dad because 
that had to make Ted feel like a complete jerk (which he is).

I'm am very excited about my trip to London.  The other guy I mentioned in 
the email, Darren, is going to be working over there for a few months so I'll 
get to see him there as well.  Plus, in November I'm going to visit my 
brother and his wife in South Korea which should be interesting.  The globe 
trotting continues.

Your weekend sounds like it's going to be pretty fun.  I wish I could be 
there as well, but it is football season so I will be in Austin this 
weekend.  I've signed up for all these internet airfare specials though, so 
if some great fares come up for Houston to San Diego I can take advantage of 
them.  Talk to you soon.

,09/21/2000,,susan.scott@enron.com,ehillegeist@hotmail.com,,"We have closure! (well, sort-of)","I'm soooo good.  The chosen path was cool, indifference.  

So, last night was Steak Night and with Nick and Wilson both in town we had a 
really good showing.  I got there about 7:30 with Nick, and the group's size 
swelled to about 12+ by 8:30 - 9:00.  About 8:00 I saw Kevin (Ted's pal - the 
one you meet a steak night) wandering around LW's obviously in search of 
someone.  Can you believe it?  He (Ted) knew I had organized this gathering - 
I know that because Nick is working right across from he and Darren and 
overheard Darren encouraging Ted's attendance (mind you Ted was not in the 
email distribution) - and he had the nerve to come.  Anyway, Kevin saw me and 
came over to chat.  He informed me that ""our friend Ted should be there 
shortly"" to which I responded, ""You would know better than me at this 
point"".  The subject was dropped until he felt the need to raise it again.  
He asked if Ted and I parted on good terms/ bad terms, etc.  I said there 
really weren't any terms, I just hadn't heard a peep out of him for about 2 
weeks.  Kevin wanted to know if I was going to break a bottle over Ted's head 
and cause a big scene.  When I said no, I think he was genuinely 
disappointed.  I said in order for me to do something like that I would have 
to care about the ""loss"" and that, while a week or two earlier I might have 
cared a bit more, with each passing day the ""loss"" seems less and less like 
much of a loss.  Kevin told me I was better-off without Ted.  To go even 
further, he informed me that there is no way he would ever let a daughter of 
his date Ted nor any of his ""girl-friends"".  He said that while he thought 
Ted was a great guy (i.e. fun to be around, good stories, etc.) he wasn't 
good dating material.  I agreed with Kevin saying ""Ted is a great guy, he 
just makes a lousy man"" (don't you like that one?).  I then went on to say 
""Anyway, I'm destined for bigger and better things, right?"".  Kevin: ""Much 
bigger and much better.""  About this time my parents showed up...the plot 
thickens.  I introduced Kevin to my parents and since both my Dad and Kevin 
were in the Navy and attended Colorado they had much to talk about.  The two 
of them had probably been talking for about half an hour when 
""dum-da-dum-dum"" Ted shows up.  He approaches our group because he sees Kevin 
and is forced to make eye-contact with me.  I give him a ""hey"" and he gives 
me the arm squeeze and a much too pleasant ""how's it going?"".  He asked what 
Kevin and my Dad were talking about, I told him the Navy, he said don't get 
Kevin started or you'll never shut him up...Then he walked away.  He never 
acknowledged my parents nor did he ever speak to me again the rest of the 
evening.  The beautiful thing is Kevin stays and talks with my Dad for 
another half hour and when Darren shows up he hangs out with ""my group"" for 
quite a while before going to join Ted.  My parents and I ate our steaks 
right behind Ted and then went back over to our group at the picnic table 
when we were finished.  It really was a great night.  I would almost say I 
was glowing (I was having so much fun with my friends and family and it 
wasn't a show for Ted's benefit...I really was having a great time).  So, 
when my parents decide to head out they walked over to Ted/Kevin's table to 
say good-bye to Kevin.  It was awesome.  Ted's sitting right next to Kevin 
while Kevin and my Dad are talking and appears to be actually shrinking in 
his chair.  Yet again no acknowledgement of my parents - he couldn't even 
make eye-contact.  I ended up staying there for at least another hour and 
then went with a few of the guys to the Ale House.  Needless to say I was 
very hung over today.  Anyway, there's the story...He's a complete and utter 
ass-hole.  So I'm done.  And no, there is no way he could weasel his way back 
in to my good graces.  

Now on to a fun subject, my trip to London.  I bought my ticket today ( I 
think I got hosed a little bit, but it was the cheapest ticket I could find - 
$450 before taxes).  I will arrive at Heathrow airport around 7:00 a.m. 
Friday the 6th and depart about 11:00 a.m. on Tuesday the 10th.  I'm very 
excited about the trip, I really need to get out of Houston.  I leave the 
activities in your capable hands.  ( bear in mind I will have to see Darren 
and Nick at some point).

Everyone's pretty much on the same page as far as their disappointment in 
said individual goes.  I think we all expected a little bit more out of him.  
Oh well, so I'm single again.  Just think how incredible it'll be when I find 
someone I feel even more for than Ted (at least that's what I'm focusing 
on).  So do we know if Pat Fitzgerald is single?

Anyway, I've found I'm not that attracted to cowards (which is exactly the 
catagory I'd put Ted in right now).

Hope everything's good with you (especially the firm recruiting).  I'm coming 
up this weekend for the game - hopefully Friday night - and wanted to see if 
you and Doug wanted to go out either Friday night or after the game 
Saturday.  I hope you guys are planning on going to the game because I'd love

What's the word?  So when do you head over to London and what pray-tell will 
you be doing over there.  I'm planning on going to visit Em and Katy around 
the first weekend of October (sometime between the 4th and 10th), if you're

interest...a guy who used to work in Ben's old group (and is now trading 
credit derivatives in London...see how I'm hooking you up with all these

nonconforming agreement filed 
by Dynegy Midstream...sounds a little bit like what the TW guys are trying to 
do, if I understand the 
concept of volumetric rates correctly.  Left a message for my friend at DMP 
but he (like everyone else)
is out 'til next year.  But since there were no subsequent orders issued in 
the docket I assume there were 
no problems with the filing.

I'm still leaning towards recommending the $0 demand/ $0.02 commodity + file 
as nego. rate approach.
If Steve Harris is OK with the idea of doing a deal that requires filing, I 
will draft something and send it your way.

* * *
The referenced negotiated transaction provides for a transportation service 
under DMP's Rate Schedule
FTS. Rather than paying a reservation charge, the negotiated agreement 
specifies that KGS will pay
a volumetric rate. The volumetric rate will equal DMP's maximum interruptible 
transportation service rate as
set forth in DMP's tariff. . .The contract also (a) specifies five Dth/d as 
KGS' maximum daily reservation 
quantity, (b) lists KGS' primary receipt as Meter # 9999999 and (c) 
identifies five primary delivery points for 
KGS. . . Upon filing Docket No. RP99-240-000, DMP stated that it agreed to 
the above negotiated rate so 
that KGS could serve small residential customers on DMP's system under a firm 
rate schedule."

question is that it totally depends on how Greg divided the community 
property with his ex.  He agreed with me that a will is a good idea in any 
case because you can arrange things so that you avoid legal proceedings and 
save a lot in taxes!  Our friend Tony Maluski does probate work:  I believe 
his number is 713-228-7401.  He's a nice guy and I believe him to be 
competent; however, I think it is a good idea to shop around when you're 
doing something routine like a will or an uncontested divorce, so I'd advise 
calling several lawyers and see who you like best and who will give you the 
best deal.  If I can find some other names/numbers for you, I will.  Hope

Thought I'd give you a little bit of an update regarding Ted...

So I didn't get back to the office until Wednesday last week because I was in 
Austin Tuesday for that recruiting trip.  When I got in I of course 
immediately checked my email...nothing.  I also didn't have any messages at 
any of the 3 phones I can be reached through.  Come Thursday afternoon, still 
no interaction...I am pissed.  About 2:00 p.m. he calls.  He asks me about 
San Diego and I ask him about Austin...both trips were great.  We discuss 
UCLA and UT football for  a while...I of course get riled up.  He informs me 
that he is going to be trading corn (yes, you heard me corn) for Enron.  
While he is very excited about trading I get the impression he feels a little 
overwhelmed and he is a very concerned about how much trading will limit his 
vacation time.  He said that he and Darren (the guy he works with) had been 
meeting with consultants all week to get up to speed and therefore the week 
had pretty much just been one long meeting.  It is around this time that he 
brings up the vacation thing and how, to his dismay, as a trader you work 
when the markets are open and you're only off when they're closed.  As a 
result, he's decided to get in his long visit home ASAP, i.e. ""I'm leaving 
tomorrow (Friday) to go to California for a week.""  I make sure I heard him 
correctly and yes he said leaving, tomorrow and  1 whole week (7 days) AND at 
no point does he ask to get together before he leaves.  So, that was 
Thursday.  I'm down on his floor again on Friday to talk to my old group and, 
to my dismay, run in to him.  We exchange pleasantries, I ask him when he's 
leaving (5:00 p.m.), he informs me he is going to sleep for the entire week

First things first, I got the personality test...very interesting.  I took it 
twice.  The first time I was a Mastermind (like Katy) and the second I was a 
Mentor (like Matt)  I think I only changed two answers between the first and 
second test.  Anyway, definitely a fun little intro to a rather boring Monday 
morning.

I was trying to remember where we left on in the saga of Ted Noble.  I guess 
the last time I had emailed you Ted had to spend the night at Darren's 
apartment because he'd left his keys in his locker at the Met.  Well, if 
you'll remember at the end of the email he said he'd talk to me later, which 
is extremely relevant considering he was supposed to tell me whether we could 
go get a drink that night or not.  I knew he had his presentation that day so 
I figured he'd call later that afternoon to tell me yeah or neah...I received 
no call, no email, no nothing.  Of course, always wanting to give others the 
benefit of the doubt I figured the presentation must have taken longer than 
expected and afterward he'd decided to just go to Austin and pick up his 
friend from the airport.  If that were the case, knowing Ted, I thought he 
must have just forgotten that he'd told me he'd call.  WRONG!!!!  Friday at 
work I had to go down to his floor (for legitimate reasons I swear) and he 
was there, the jerk.  He didn't see me though nor did he try communicate with 
me at all that day.  

Flash forward to the next week.  I didn't get back to the office until 
Wednesday because I was in Austin Tuesday for a recruiting trip.  When I got 
in I of course immediately checked my email...nothing.  I also didn't have 
any messages at any of the 3 phones I can be reached through.  So it's now

So here we are, or rather here I am in Houston...alone.  Any thoughts?

On a brighter note, tell Katy I think I'm going to try and come Oct 4 - Oct 9 
so that I can see both of you.  Also, I understand your dilemma regarding 
Claudia, but I definitely don't think you should look a gift horse in the 
mouth (if you know what I mean).  That first month after Katy leaves is going 
to be awkward so it's best to have someone there even if only to act as a 
crutch until you find your footing.  I'm sure Monique can testify to a little 
extra weight dealing with me since you and Matt both took off.  And speaking 
of Matt, no I haven't heard a thing from the turn-coat.  I need to shoot him 
an email and see how things are shaping up for him.  I'm willing to bet 
though that moving to Austin hasn't solved all of his problems...just 
transplanted to a prettier location.

Get back to me with anything...I'm desperate for positive energy.  Oh, and 
I'm going to try to meet with that Director friend of mine this week to talk 
about swinging a rotation in London (he has 75 employees over there that work 
for him right now), and I'm going to set up a meeting with the lady in charge 
of my rotations within the analyst program to make sure I'm doing everything 
I can to get over there and still get promoted.

   3. A person capable of appreciating hack value.

   4. A person who is good at programming quickly.

   5. An expert at a particular program, or one who frequently does work
      using it or on it; as in `a Unix hacker'.
      (Definitions 1 through 5 are correlated, and people who fit them
      congregate.)

   6. An expert or enthusiast of any kind. One might be an astronomy
      hacker, for example.

   7. One who enjoys the intellectual challenge of creatively overcoming
      or circumventing limitations.

   8. [deprecated] A malicious meddler who tries to discover sensitive
      information by poking around. Hence `password hacker', `network
      hacker'. The correct term for this sense is cracker.

[Originally, someone who makes furniture with an axe.]

,09/06/2000,,wsmith@wordsmith.org,linguaphile@wordsmith.org,,A.Word.A.Day--Murphy's Law,"Murphy's Law (MUR-feez law) noun

   The facetious proposition that if something can go wrong, it will.

[Americanism, after a fictitious Murphy, allegedly the name of a bungling
mechanic in U.S. Navy educational cartoons of the 1950s.]

   ""In the original, Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis played the Kellermans from
   Ohio, a nice couple whose trip to the Big Apple becomes the ultimate
   fulfillment of Murphy's Law when they lose their luggage, their hotel
   room, their money and their good names.""
   Dann Gire, Get out & stay out!, The Daily Herald, Apr 2, 1999.

Here is a second opinion on Murphy's Law. This one is from The New Hacker's
Dictionary, Third Edition, compiled by Eric S. Raymond.            -Anu

   Murphy's Law /prov./ The correct, *original* Murphy's Law reads:
   ""If there are two or more ways to do something, and one of those ways can
   result in a catastrophe, then someone will do it."" This is a principle of
   defensive design, cited here because it is usually given in mutant forms
   less descriptive of the challenges of design for lusers. For example, you
   don't make a two-pin plug symmetrical and then label it `THIS WAY UP'; if
   it matters which way it is plugged in, then you make the design
   asymmetrical.

   Edward A. Murphy, Jr. was one of the engineers on the rocket-sled
   experiments that were done by the U.S. Air Force in 1949 to test human
   acceleration tolerances (USAF project MX981). One experiment involved a
   set of 16 accelerometers mounted to different parts of the subject's body.
   There were two ways each sensor could be glued to its mount, and somebody
   methodically installed all 16 the wrong way around. Murphy then made the
   original form of his pronouncement, which the test subject (Major John
   Paul Stapp) quoted at a news conference a few days later.

   Within months `Murphy's Law' had spread to various technical cultures
   connected to aerospace engineering. Before too many years had gone by
   variants had passed into the popular imagination, changing as they went.
   Most of these are variants on ""Anything that can go wrong, will""; this is
   correctly referred to as Finagle's Law. The memetic drift apparent in
   these mutants clearly demonstrates Murphy's Law acting on itself!

,09/04/2000,,wsmith@wordsmith.org,linguaphile@wordsmith.org,,A.Word.A.Day--Stockholm Syndrome,"Stockholm syndrome (STOK-hom SIN drom) noun

   A phenomenon in which a hostage begins to identify with and grow
   sympathetic to his or her captor.

[After Stockholm where a hostage in a 1973 bank robbery became romantically
attached to one of her captors.]

   ""Speaking of refugees, stories such as the Oct. 27 article reveal a sort
   of Stockholm syndrome among those imprisoned on our highways every day.
   We can only smile when we hear people explaining why they love their
   commute: `I focus on the day ahead,' `I listen to the radio,' or, our
   favorite, `I use the time to relax,' white-knuckle relaxation, no doubt!""
   Civilize our transport, The Providence Journal, Nov 5, 1999.

Consider the Stockholm syndrome if you have any doubt about the veracity of
the saying, `Fact is stranger than fiction'. In 1973, following a botched
robbery attempt, the perpetrator held four employees of a Stockholm bank
hostage in the bank vault. At the end of the five day captivity, police were
surprised to discover that the hostages were afraid of them and resisted
rescue. They had bonded with the robber, a prison escapee, and became
sympathetic with him. Later, they started a defense fund for him, testified
in his favor, and one of the female hostages even fell in love and became
engaged to him.

Of course, this phenomenon is not limited to the Swedes. Patty Hearst of the
US, heiress to the Hearst publishing fortune, was kidnapped in 1974 by the
Symbionese Liberation Army. She later joined her abductors and participated
in a bank robbery with them. More recently, an Indian Airlines flight was
hijacked and the passengers were holed up in the plane for more than a week.
At the conclusion of the drama, some passengers were heard saying about the
hijackers, `they were not bad people'.

Why do people turn around and begin to sympathize with their tormenters in
situations like these? It is one of the mysteries of the way the human mind
works. Perhaps it is a way for people to cope with the immense, immediate
stress of being in a situation where their lives depend on their captors. If
one threatens to shoot, and then doesn't, hasn't he done a favor to us the
mind apparently rationalizes. In a place devoid of external contact, the
view of reality becomes distorted and the victims may develop a fondness for
the only person in their life.

This week in AWAD we look at some of the syndromes, paradoxes, laws, and
principles that govern our minds.                                    -Anu

MMBtu/day with alternate rights to California 
at a higher rate.  SoCal filed a protest and I'm working on the response.  In 
part, they are alleging that TW is ""attempting to exploit a weakness"" in the 
GISB procedures to the detriment of existing customers.  For example, under 
TW's tariff (which they concede is GISB compliant), primary firm cannot bump 
alt. firm in cycle 2.  SoCal says this means that any primary shipper 
attempting to deliever to an in-path alt. point will be unable to re-nominate 
to its primary point once this ""alternate"" capacity [I assume they mean 
USGT's] is confirmed.  According to SoCal this will substantially limit 
shippers' flexibility, including the ability to use market area pooling.  
Once gas is nominated thru a pool its subsequent movement to a delivery point 
is defined as an al. delivery regardless of the rights of the capacity under 
which it moves.  Thus by manipulating the GISB cycle process, TW and USGT 
will bump firm shippers.

I could really use your help in responding to this argument.  (First of all, 
I'm not sure I even understand it!)  If either of you have a few minutes 
today or tomorrow when we could get together, that would be great.  Also --

so I am pleased.  Plus, my friend just emailed me from San Diego to inform me 
that she can get us a great table to see the Symphony's last performance of

you decided yet (the latter would not surprise me in the least...you're a fly

see if you had any interest in going to grab a bite to eat or just a drink 
after work tomorrow or Friday night (in light of our heavy work loads, etc. I

Sorry for the delayed response.  I can't express to you how excited I am to 
be coming out there this weekend.  After the last week and a half of work I 
am in desperate need of rest and relaxation (that of course means lots of 
shopping).  As far as activities go, I'm pretty much up for anything.  My 
guess is I'm probably going to want to take a quick nap when I get in 
Saturday morning before starting the weekend's activities, but after that I 
say we just get going.  The symphony sounds incredible as do the races or the 
polo match so I'll just leave the final choices to your discretion.  I would 
definitely be up for a trip to the zoo if you want to go, but considering I 
go there every time I'm in San Diego I could miss it in order to do/see some 
other things.  The only things I insist upon are ample time outdoors and good 
seafood.  Anyway,  I arrive in San Diego on America West flight 2180 at about 
9:00 a.m. and leave Monday at 6:10 p.m. so we've almost got three full days 
to work with.

Cinderella was now 75 years old. After a fulfilling life with the now
dead
Prince, she happily sat upon her rocking chair, watching the world go by
from her front porch, with a cat named Bob for companionship.

One sunny afternoon, out of nowhere, appeared the Fairy Godmother.

Cinderella said ""Fairy Godmother, what are you doing here after all
these
years??""

The Fairy godmother replied ""Well Cinderella, since you have lived a
good,
wholesome life since we last met, I have decided to grant you 3 wishes.

Is there anything for which your heart still yearns?""

Cinderella was taken aback, overjoyed and after some thoughtful
consideration, and almost under her breath she uttered her first wish:

""I wish I was wealthy beyond comprehension."" Instantly, her rocking
chair
was turned into solid gold. Cinderella was stunned.

Bob, her old faithful cat, jumped off her lap and scampered to the edge
of
the porch, quivering with fear. Cinderella said ""Oh thank you, Fairy
Godmother"".

The Fairy Godmother replied, ""It is the least I can do. What does your
heart
want for your second wish?"" Cinderella looked down at her frail body,
and
said: ""I wish I was young and full of the beauty of youth again.""

At once, her wish having been desired became reality, and her beautiful
youthful visage had returned. Cinderella felt stirrings inside her that
had
been dormant for years and a long forgotten vigor and vitality began to
course through her.

Then the Fairy Godmother again spoke ""You have one more wish, what shall
you
have?"" Cinderella looks over to the frightened cat in the corner and
says"";
""I wish for you to transform Bob, my old cat, into a beautiful, and
handsome
young man"".

Magically, Bob suddenly underwent so fundamental a change in his
biological
make-up, that when complete he stood before her, a man, so beautiful the
like of which she nor the world had ever seen, so fair indeed that birds
began to fall from the sky at his feet.

The Fairy Godmother again spoke: ""Congratulations, Cinderella.

Enjoy your new life."" And, with a blazing shock of bright blue
electricity,
she was gone. For a few eerie moments, Bob and Cinderella looked into
each
other's eyes, Cinderella sat, breathless, gazing at the most stunningly
perfect man she had ever seen. Then Bob walked over to Cinderella, who
sat
transfixed in her rocking chair, and held her close in his young
muscular
arms.

He leaned in close blowing her golden hair with his warm breath as he
whispered:

""I bet you regret having me neutered now, don't you?"""

now.  Mack Brown is a master at pacing a teams rise to the top.  With the #1

Sorry your week has been going poorly (I guess you feel like I did Wednesday 
night).  But on the bright side, college football starts this weekend which 
is always a plus and today is Friday which makes this bad week over.  I am in 
middle of packing once again for another move but the good news is that I get 
kicked out by 5:00 today.  I was checking out UT schedule and it looks like 
they have a pansy schedule (unlike UCLA that has to play Alabama #3 and

directions for form and expression are customarily written in Italian

shallower domains of popular movies, TV and best-selling novels, which
have given us a host of Mafia-derived terms, the contribution of the
language of Dante to English is far more useful and subtle than many of
us may realize. Whether the subject is philosophy, politics, diplomacy,
religion, sport, or even chess, we may thank the Italians for having
coined the just-right words we lacked in English until they came along
to help us out. Like their wonderful food -- there's another word-subject
for you -- we have merrily gobbled these words up and incorporated them as
our own, as English always does. This week's theme thanks the Italians for

we're still dating come December, you and Chuck can meet him when you come 
back to visit.  I'm planning on dragging him to at least one of the U.T. 
games, I just have to find out when he wants to go (as well as properly 
prepare him for the Scott/Kelley/Parks/Wild Card gang and the full-day affair

My week is actually going very well so far (my trader left around noon so 
today should be a piece of cake).  I know you
guys have been working really hard the last couple of days, but I hope it 
paid off and the presentation went well 
yesterday.  However, given your comment about y'alls idea getting the axe in 
the short term, I'm not sure that was 
necessarily the case.  Anyway, I'm sure at least your steak dinner was a hit 
(so were you able to resist the red wine 
this time, you lush?).  

In keeping with my very serious nature (yes, you heard me serious), I've 
attached little story for you...I got a pretty
good chuckle out of this one.

PS. - Thanks again for carting me around and feeding me Saturday...I, as 
usual, had a great time.  Oh, and by the way, kudos to both of us for 
actually making it through a home movie"
,04/24/2000,,susan.scott@enron.com,,,contract approvals,"You asked whether current contract approval procedures require the marketers 
to get Legal's approval on all transportation contracts.  The answer is no.  
If you look at the ET&S policy on authority to grant transportation and 
storage discounts (I can fax it to you if you don' t have it), there is a 
column for ""Pre-approved Terms"" and one for ""Non Pre-Approved Terms"".  
Contracts that are not on a pre-approved form always have to have the Legal 
Dept's approval.  Contracts on pre-approved forms with a total discount (for 
the entire contract term) of less than $1.2 million do not need Legal's 
approval; those above the threshold do. Does that make sense?  As far as I 
know our marketers have been following this.  I spoke with TK and she is 
aware of the policy, and she is also aware that she needs to show me any 
contract that deviates from our standard language.  She has also discussed 
this with Steve Harris recently to make sure he's comfortable with the 
policy.  

If we need to discuss this further please let me know."

the Company in accordance with all applicable laws and in a moral and honest 
manner.

To make certain that we understand what is expected of us, Enron has adopted 
certain policies, approved by the Board of Directors, which are in the Code 
of Ethics July 2000, formerly known as the Enron Conduct of Business 
Affairs.  This year, we,ve made some revisions to our Code of Ethics to 
address recent policies approved by the Board of Directors and adopted by 
Enron.  These changes include:  

  Principles of Human Rights have been added, which describe Enron,s 
responsibility to conduct itself according to basic tenets of human behavior 
that transcend industries, cultures, economics, and local, regional and 
national boundaries (see pg. 4);
  Additional information about our Business Ethics policy about legal 
contracts, the selection of outside counsel, and disparaging remarks made by 
employees about Enron (see pg. 12);
  Additional information about Enron,s policy on confidential information and 
trade secrets (see pg. 14);
  A decrease in the number of days computer passwords are valid under Enron,s 
policy on communication services and equipment (see pg. 35);
  Additional information about criminal penalties and civil fines assessed by 
the US government under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (see pg. 50); and
  Additional language regarding Enron,s policy on conflicts of interests, 
investments, and outside business interests of employees (see pg. 57).   

The Code of Ethics contains commonsense rules of conduct that most employees 
practice on a day-to-day basis.  However, I ask that you read them carefully 
and completely to make certain that you are complying with these policies.  
It is absolutely essential that you fully comply with these policies in the 
future.  If you have any questions, I encourage you to discuss them with your 
supervisor or Enron legal counsel.

In next few weeks, you will receive the Code of Ethics July 2000 booklet and 
a Certificate of Compliance, which you must sign as a statement of your 
agreement to comply with the policies stated in the Code of Ethics booklet 
during your employment with Enron.  You may do this in one of two ways:

  Select the Code of Ethics option located at eHRonline.enron.com and 
complete the Certificate of Compliance.
  Sign and return the Certificate of Compliance to Elaine Overturf, Deputy 
Corporate Secretary, Enron Corp. 1400 Smith Street, EB4836, Houston, Texas 
77002-7369.

Thank you for your cooperation and for all you do to make Enron a successful

,08/14/2000,,wsmith@wordsmith.org,linguaphile@wordsmith.org,,A.Word.A.Day--dol,"dol (dol) noun

   A unit for measuring the intensity of pain.

[From Latin dol(or) pain.]

   ""Minutes later it was still a comfortable four dol--what did they do, shut
   off the steam? Finally I removed my hand and examined my fingers: great
   blisters on thumb and finger.""
   Richard Kopperdahl, Bettervue hospital, Village Voice, Oct 3, 1995.

One doesn't have to know the unit of pain to realize that the unit of joy
is not the dollar, or any other currency for that matter. We don't have to
look far to discover that some of the richest people on this planet are
not the most happy ones. Having lived in two not only geographic but also
economically antipodal places, I've met persons who were blissful and those
who were miserable, but their conditions were hardly a function of money.
Certainly it is good to have the means to pay for basic necessities, but
after that it's only a series of zeros in some account.

English author Samuel Butler once said, ""Words are like money; there is
nothing so useless, unless when in actual use."" We can't do much about
circulating money (which I hope you have plenty of), but we do try our best
to put words in actual use. This week it is those words that make one say,
""I didn't know there was a word for that.""                          -Anu

,04/25/2000,,susan.scott@enron.com,,,contract issue,"Drew, I wanted you to be aware of a potential dispute with regard to our 
consultant, Mark Baldwin of IGS.  Our consulting agreement with IGS (which 
has now terminated) provided for a flat fee, plus an incentive fee calculated 
using the net present value of any contract ""identified by IGS"" and entered 
into during the term of the consulting agreement.  During the term of the 
agreement, TW entered into its Gallup Expansion agreement with Southern.  IGS 
is now claiming it brought in the deal and so is entitled to an incentive 
fee.  While it is undisputed that Mark discussed the deal with Southern, 
Southern was also on Lorraine's list of shippers to contact for Gallup 
Expansion capacity.  Also, the capacity was posted for all to see.  So, while 
Mark can certainly claim he ""identified"" the deal, he was not alone in doing 
so. 

Steve is going to call Mark in response to his letter (after he talks to 
Lorraine to verify facts).  Our thinking is that if we offer IGS some money 
they will be happy.  We would really like to preserve what has been a good 
working relationship with this consultant.   On the other hand, I think we 
could probably take the position that they are not entitled to any incentive 
fee.  However, since the contract is silent as to whether IGS has to be the 
only party bringing in the deal in order to qualify for the incentive fee, 
this position is not as strong as I'd like it to be, and IGS might sue TW.  
The amount in dispute could be as much as $200,000, depending on what rate we 
use in calculating net present value.

If you have any problem with our offering to pay part of the incentive fee to 
IGS, let me know.  I think it will be very important for Steve not to admit 
that Mark helped in any way in getting the deal -- just in case they do 
decide to take us to court."

ALJ Biren has given us until Friday of this week (April 28, 2000) to file
""errata"" to the Comprehensive Settlement.

So far, I am planning to make the following non-substantive changes:

1.  The table of contents was seriously messed up by an ""automatic update""
feature in Word just before we duplicated and filed.  I will be putting it
back to the state you saw in the final draft.

2.  On p.7, section 1.12, put a period at the end of the last sentence.

3.  On p.9, section 1.1.3.1,  two thirds of the way down the page, I will be
changing ""subject to adjustment annual by the base rate PBR formula"" to
""subject to adjustment annually by the base rate PBR formula"".

4. On p.27, section 1.5.4, in the third full paragraph on the page, I will
be changing ""If only one customer has an OFO day"" to ""If only one customer
class has an OFO day"".

5.  Also on p.27, section 1.5.4, bottom line on the page, I will be filling
in the blank with ""C"" (so it reads ""Appendix C"")


In the category of ""maybe substantive"",

1.  On p.10, section 1.1.3.2, three lines from the bottom of the page, the
date ""October 1, 2000"" would be changed to ""October 1, 2001"".  This sentence
refers to including the cost of backbone transmission for core customers
buying gas from SoCalGas in the ""procurement"" rate.  Obviously, our intent
was to do that only once we had unbundled backbone transmission, which
happens on October 1, 2001.


In the category of ""substantive"":

1.  Our capacity term sheet had said that we would unbundled ""additional""
(non-reliability) storage for CTAs effective upon implementation of the
settlement (See p.4).  The filed settlement managed to drop the section that
provided for this option for CTAs prior to the principal storage change on
April 1, 2001.  (The filed settlement is ok for the period starting April 1,
2001).  So, to be consistent with the term sheet, we need to insert
something back into the settlement to allow CTAs to opt out of
non-reliability storage in the period from the effective date (90 days after
approval) to April 1, 2001.  Obviously, this may not be a very long period.
John Leslie has suggested inserting at the very beginning of Section
5.4.4.3:  ""In the partial storage year beginning on the effective date of
this Settlement Agreement, and....[continue with current text].""  We would
need to cover as part of implementation filings the exact mechanism/pricing
for SoCalGas purchasing gas in storage owned by CTAs if they opt out of
nonreliability storage prior to April 1. 2001.  SoCalGas and SDG&E are ok
with John's language and want to make sure it is ok with other signatories.


If you have any problems with any of these changes, please contact me or
Brian Cherry by noon on Friday, April 28.  My email is gsullivan@sempra.com
and my phone is (619) 699-5162.  Brian's email is bcherry@sempra.com and
phone is (213) 244-3895.

We are looking at the possibility of two or three additional changes, and
Brian may send you a follow-up message."

""let the market decide"" approach on the primary/secondary split by setting
each receipt point at its physical capacity (WH-N @ 520 and WH-S @ 500 with
the combination not greater than 680).  This approach provides more
flexibility to the shipper to move between the two points and maintain the
quality of the firm service.  I do not see any cost to SoCal or any other

I was checking on some flights for myself and happened to look at one-way

offer a senior citizen fare for $55 (age does have its advantages).

By the way,  I didn't  even realise John Cleese and Denise Richards were in 
the movie...and evidently at some point Bond hijacks a submarine.  Roger 
Ebert actually thought so much of the film he gave it 3 and 1/2 stars.  We 
may have to watch this one at some point.

              ""The World Is Not Enough"" is a splendid comic thriller, 
exciting and graceful,
               endlessly inventive. Because it is also the 19th James Bond 
movie, it comes with so
               much history that one reviews it like wine, comparing it to 
earlier famous vintages; I
               guess that's part of the fun. This is a good one."

Labor Day weekend.  It is actually the weekend after Labor Day (Sept. 9)

challenging game and relatively cool (Ha!).  Hope your day's going well.

The teacher gave her fifth grade class an assignment: 
Get their parents to tell them a story with a moral at 
the end of it. The next day the kids came back and one 
by one began to tell their stories.  

Kathy said, ""My father's a farmer and we have a lot of 
egg-laying hens.  One time we were taking our eggs to 
market in a basket on the front seat of the pickup when 
we hit a bump in the road and all the eggs went flying 
and broke and made a mess.""  ""And what's the moral of 
the story?"" Asked the teacher.  ""Don't put all your eggs 
in one basket!""  ""Very good,"" said the teacher.  

""Now, Lucy?""  

""Our family are farmers too.  But we raise chickens for 
the meat market.  We had a dozen eggs one time, but when 
they hatched we only got ten live chicks. And the moral 
to this story is, don't count your chickens until they're 
hatched.""  ""That was a fine story Lucy.""

""Johnny do you have a story to share?""  

""Yes, ma'am, my daddy told me this story about my uncle Bob.  
Uncle Bob was a pilot in Vietnam and his plane got hit.  He 
had to bail out over enemy territory and all he had was a 
bottle of whiskey, a machine gun and a machete. He drank the 
whiskey on the way down so it wouldn't break and then he 
landed right in the middle of 100 enemy troops.  He killed 
seventy of them with the machine gun until he ran out of 
bullets, then he killed twenty more with the machete till the 
blade broke and then he killed the last ten with his bare hands.""
""Good heavens,"" said the horrified teacher, ""What kind of moral 
did your daddy tell you from that horrible story?""

""Don't fuck with Uncle Bob when he's been drinking."""

A few more ""errata"" I plan to make, absent objection:

A. Creditworthiness Sections (1.2.3.2 and 2.2.3.2):

In 1.2.3.2 on p.21, under b., subitem ii. should have ""or"" inserted at the
end of the subitem and the ""or"" at the end of subitem iii. should be
stricken (so that the reports or forms listed in i., ii., and iii. are
alternatives to each other (customer only has to provide one of the three)
and subitems iv. and v. are additional required items).

In 2.2.3.2 on pp.36-37, make parallel changes in the ""or""s as stated above.

On p.22, under h., subitems i. through v. should be indented more than h.
and then items j), k) and l) should be renumbered i., j., k. (this will then
match section 2.2.3.2, which has the correct spacing/alphanumbering).

On p.22 and p.37, we'd like to drop the reference to ""U.S."" in the reference
to a letter of credit issued by a major ""U.S."" financial institution.
SoCalGas has realized that it has already had dealings with Canadian or
other foreign-owned customers where it was reasonable to rely on letters of
credit from major financial institutions of the parent's country.  (This
should be ok with Paul Amirault, eh?)

B. Btu content

On pp.10 (twice) and 31, the settlement says we are assuming 1,016 Btu/mcf
for the heating value of gas (subject to revision by Commission during term
of settlement).  We have the wrong units.  It is 1,016 Btu per cubic foot,
not per thousand cubic feet.  We'd propose to change the number to 1,016
Btu/cf (not ""1,016 Btu/mcf"")  On p.33, we got the units right the first time
and don't need to change them on that page.

Again, I'd appreciate you getting back to me or Brian Cherry by noon Friday
if you have any problem with the above changes."

,07/05/2000,,susan.scott@enron.com,cscott_korea@yahoo.com,,Re: back from Thailand,"Hi yourself,

Glad to hear you all had a good time in Thailand, although I get the 
impression you could have done without some of the sights.  Mom thinks it 
must be fate that this guy and I keep bumping into each other.

Along those lines, I had an absolutely incredible weekend.  I drove to 
Harlingen Saturday morning/afternoon (5 hr. drive) for a friend's wedding and 
then drove to Austin to meet up with Emily on Sunday.  We ate at Guerro's and 
then hit Cedar door for a little while.  There wasn't anything going on there 
so I suggested we try Cedar Street.  Funny thing is Ted, that's his name, 
walks by our table at the bar.  He stopped to say hello and ended up sitting 
down with us the rest of the evening.  His friends joined us as soon as they 
had been shot down by the girls they had been trying to woo.  We ended up 
going to Polly Esters for a little while to do some dancing.  Before we 
parted ways he asked if we had any plans for Monday night and got my cell 
phone number.  Needless to say I was feeling pretty good.  He called us 
Monday and we made plans to meet up after dinner -- we ate at Sullivan's, it 
was very good.  His birthday is July 4 (how great is that?) so I brought him 
one of those travel size bottles of Crown from the honor bar as a birthday 
gift...Big Hit.  Anyway, spent the whole night talking and getting to know 
each other and all I can say is he seems like a really good guy.  (One of the 
best signs was his reproach of denim shorts on guys, especially cut-offs...be 
sure and tell Chuck about that one because I know it's something he feels 
pretty strongly about as well.)  So at this point I'll pretty much just run 
through the stats:

Height :   6'2"" - 6'3""
Weight : about 225 lbs.
Education: UCLA (undergraduate and MBA) AND Law School ( I'm not sure where)
Birthday: 7/4/69 -- YES, he was born in a different decade than me...think it 
may be more of an issue for him than me.
Hometown: Santa Barbara, CA

ETC:  Youngest of three children.  Appears to like/be close to his family.
  Irish Catholic (we actually discussed religion)
  His dad was in the Navy
  Favorite Movies -- Fletch, Caddy Shack...he definitely has a good sense of 
humor and likes to laugh
  He really likes Texas...would like to have a ranch/lakehouse somewhere in 
the hill country

Best Quotes:    ""Every California guys idea of a dream girl is a girl in 
jeans a t-shirt and cowboy boots."" 
  ""Every Texas girls idea of a dream guy is a guy who lives on a ranch, has 
an good education, is comfortable financially and is also a great    
businessman.  Only problem is there are only four of those guys out there and 
three of them are married.""
  ""Texas girls have the ability to wrap a man around their finger quicker 
than any group of women I've ever met.""
  ""I really want to learn how to two step.""
  
So, as I'm sure you can tell there are definitely some attractive 
characteristics to this guy (to boot he was a complete gentleman in every 
capacity).  There are no plans as of yet, but I will be sure to keep you 
informed of any progress.  Write back soon and let me know how the apartment, 
the job hunt and everything else is going.

                  weird  \WEERD\  (adjective) 
                  *1 : of, relating to, or caused by witchcraft or the 
supernatural
                  : magical 
                  2 : of strange or extraordinary character : odd, fantastic 

                  Example sentence:
                  ""Hagar, the witch, chanted an awful incantation over her
                  kettleful of simmering toads, with weird effect."" (Louisa 
May
                  Alcott, Little Women) 

                  Did you know?
                  You may know today's word as a generalized term for anything
                  unusual, but ""weird"" also has older meanings that are more
                  specific. ""Weird"" derives from the Old English noun ""wyrd,""
                  essentially meaning ""fate."" By the late 8th century, the 
plural
                  ""wyrde"" had begun to appear in texts as a gloss for 
""Parcae,""
                  the Latin name for the Fates -- three goddesses who spun,
                  measured, and cut the thread of life. In the 15th and 16th
                  centuries, Scots authors employed ""werd"" or ""weird"" in the
                  phrase ""weird sisters"" to refer to the Fates. William
                  Shakespeare adopted this usage in Macbeth, in which the
                  ""weird sisters"" are depicted as three witches. Subsequent
                  adjectival use of ""weird"" grew out of a reinterpretation of 
the
                  ""weird"" in Shakespeare."

written such works in present day, but given that Austen was dealing with a 
completely different world with decidedly different expectations for the 
women in it  I cannot.  The fact that she was able to challenge those limited 
expectations and never allow her heroines to sell themselves short or 
compromise their character should not be taken for granted.  Yes, there is a 
definite romantic bent to her works, but in addition their is amazing insight 
into people, their motives, their struggles and their capacity to surprise 
even themselves.  And in the end, what conquers in her novels is the union of 
two individuals who have the utmost respect and appreciation for each other's 
minds and characters not the unequal and servile relationships that 
constituted the norm for that time."

Austen depreciated herself as a ""miniaturist"" and a domestic novelist of 
restricted scope, but her literary legacy is large. She was also able to lay 
self-deprecation aside, however, and in Northanger Abbey she declared that 
novels -- her chosen genre -- are works in which ""the greatest powers of the 
mind are displayed, in which the most thorough knowledge of human nature, the 
happiest delineation of its varieties, the liveliest effusions of wit and 
humour are conveyed to the world in the best chosen language.""(

Austen's work brims with general statements that are contradicted by the 
people in her stories. For instance, Pride and Prejudice opens by noting that 
""It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a 
good fortune, must be in want of a wife."" The book then describes Mrs. 
Bennett, mother of a household full of marriageable daughters as ""a woman of 
mean understanding, little information, and uncertain temper."" As Austen 
acquaints us with the tale of each daughter's engagements, she 
wonders,                    ""For what do we live, but to make sport for our 
neighbors and  laugh at them in our turn?""As Austen acquaints us with the

though don't worry).  They, as well as myself, are definitely fans of the

unrelated themes (I just couldn't cut any more).

""Courage, it would seem, is nothing less than the power to overcome danger, 
misfortune, fear, injustice, while continuing to affirm inwardly that life 
with all its sorrows is good; that everything is meaningful even if in a 
sense beyond our understanding; and that there is always tomorrow."" -- 
Dorothy Thompson

""One should guard against preaching to young people success in the customary

,05/04/2000,,susan.scott@enron.com,benjamin.freeman@enron.com,,Reminder,"While I don't truly fear you becoming a bitter individual as a result of 
these negative experiences, I do feel the highlighted section below is now 
more appropriate than ever.

One must keep their eyes open and use all of the wisdom they possess when 
they trust.  Just as I suggested that positive experiences can cause one's 
level of trust to grow exponentially, negative experiences can cause 
irreparable harm.  If you trust blindly or too willingly and that trust is 
violated it colours every aspect of your life.  There are too many people in 
this world that have become bitter and cynical, not because they were born 
that way but, because they handed out trust haphazardly and too many times 
that trust was thrown back in their face.  I don't mean to suggest from the 
above that one should live in a day-to-day mind-set of distrust but rather 
that they must really look at people and all the aspects which they posses.  
I have come to the conclusion that if you spend most of your time observing 
and listening to people rather than always taking the lead you will learn a 
great deal more about them and their character.  The smallest acts and 
statements can in fact say the most, so always be observant. (This includes 
listening to what others have to say and paying attention to the opinions of 
people whom you respect.)

To that end I have one last comment...I am constantly amazed and periodically 
reminded what fragile creatures we humans are.  That beyond the hype and 
self-grandizing the basic components of ourselves (our experiences, fears, 
cares, concerns, needs etc.) cannot be completely disregarded and will always 
be a part of us.  I think that only by recognizing those components and 
trying to understand their origin can we truly become stronger."

SoCalGas did not oppose the revision and would accept the language as 
proposed by PG&E, especially if it would gain their non-opposition.? There

of pools available per shipper.? Dynegy was not able to garner internal 
approval in time for us to prepare the errata for filing later today, so 
Pooling revisions were taken off the table.? SoCalGas supports the pooling 
revisions and no other party expressed any concerns.? ALJ Biren asked us to

outstanding differences, I could not include the revisions that were 
circulated (to our dismay).? PG&E has now indicated they will file limited 
opposition and they have now served a discovery request upon SoCalGas with

                   and unlimited this month that you're capable of
                   almost anything! (You've privately believed that
                   the rules don't necessarily apply to you.) This
                   month, your incredible adaptability and powers of
                   persuasion help you shed the status quo and
                   break out of the corral. Unless you catch your
                   foot in a bear trap, nothing can stop you. People
                   are fascinated by your mind, wit, ideas, and

                   Aquarius!) Your views are welcomed and
                   provoke others to investigate things they may
                   have taken for granted. Speak up during the first
                   week, especially if it's to announce you're
                   starting a new venture. Business travel is likely
                   during the first and third weeks, especially if
                   contractual issues need to be finalized. Travel is
                   actually enjoyable this month and can open your
                   eyes to fresh horizons. Aquarius. . . you've

As for myself I'm doing well.  I had incredible seats at the Opera Friday and 
spent the rest of the weekend in Austin so all in all it was a great weekend.
Remind me again where you will be based in the new job (I thought NY but 
wasn't sure).  Also, when do you make the Big Move?

As I've said before keep me posted on all your endeavors...they are always 
interesting.

                  : the use of archaisms (as in a historical novel) 

                  Example sentence:
                  ""Get rid of the gadzookery,"" Bruce's editor cautioned.
                  ""Mirabella can perfectly well say 'please' instead of 
'prithee.'""

Charles
                  Dickens' Nicholas Nickleby. We won't accuse Dickens of
                  gadzookery (""the bane of historical fiction,"" as historical 
novelist
                  John Vernon called it in Newsday magazine), because we
                  assume people actually said ""gadzooks"" back in the 1830s.
                  That mild oath is an old-fashioned euphemism, so it is 
thought,
                  for ""God's hooks"" (a reference, supposedly, to the nails of 
the
                  Crucifixion). But it's a fine line today's historical 
novelist must
                  toe, avoiding expressions like ""zounds"" and ""pshaw"" and 
""tush""
                  (""tushery"" is a synonym of the newer ""gadzookery,"" which 
first
                  cropped up in the 1950s), as well as ""gadzooks,"" while at

The following is a pre-approved posting whose purpose is to offer insight
and advice to Northerners moving South.

1.  Save all manner of bacon grease. You will be instructed on how to use
it
shortly.
2.  Just because you can drive on snow and ice does not mean Southerners
can. Stay home the two days of the year it snows.
3.  If you do run your car into a ditch, don't panic.  Four men in the cab
of a four-wheel pick-up with a 12-pack of beer and a tow chain will be
along shortly. Don't try to help them. Just stay out of their way. This is
what they live for.
4.  You can ask Southerners for directions, but unless you already know the
positions of key hills, trees and rocks, you're better off trying to find
it yourself.
5.  Remember: ""Y'all is singular.""  ""All y'all is plural."" All y'all's is
plural possessive.""
6. Get used to hearing, ""You ain't from around here, are you?""
7.  Don't be worried that you don't understand anyone. They don't
understand you, either.
8.  The first Southern expression to creep into a transplanted Northerner's
vocabulary is the adjective ""big ol,"" as in ""big ol truck,"" or ""big ol
boy.""
9.  As you are cursing the person driving 15 mph in a 55-mph zone, directly
in the middle of the road, remember: ALL Southern folks learned to drive on
a John Deere, and this is the proper speed and lane position for that
vehicle.
10. If you hear a Southerner exclaim, ""Hey, y'all, watch this!"" Stay out of
his way. These are likely the last words he will ever say, or worse still,
that you will ever hear.
11. Most Southerners do not use turn signals; they ignore those who do. In
fact, if you see a signal blinking on a car with a Southern license plate,
you may rest assured that it was already turned on when the car was
purchased.
12. If it can't be fried in bacon grease, it ain't worth cooking, let alone
eating.
13. The wardrobe you always brought out in September can wait until
December.
14. If there is the prediction of the slightest chance of even the most
minuscule accumulation of snow, your presence is required at the local
grocery store. It does not matter if you need anything from the store.
It is just something you're supposed to do.
15. Satellite dishes are very popular in the South. When you purchase
one,it
is positioned directly in front of the house. This is logical, bearing in
mind that the dish cost considerably more than the house, and should,
therefore, be prominently displayed.
16.  Be advised that in the South, ""He needed killin'"" is a valid defense.

,04/06/2000,,susan.scott@enron.com,"gary.stadler@enron.com, tobin.carlson@enron.com",,Webster's Word of the Day,"The Word of the Day for April 6 is: 

                  ambrosia  \am-BRO-zhuh\  (noun) 
                  1 a : the food of the Greek and Roman gods b : the ointment
                  or perfume of the gods 
                  *2 : something extremely pleasing to taste or smell 
                  3 : a dessert made of oranges and shredded coconut 

                  Example sentence:
                  ""We feasted that evening as on nectar and ambrosia; and not
                  the least delight of the entertainment was the smile of
                  gratification with which our hostess regarded us, as we 
satisfied
                  our famished appetites on the delicate fare she liberally
                  supplied."" (Charlotte Bronte, Jane Eyre) 

                  Did you know?
                  ""Ambrosia"" literally means ""immortality"" in Greek; it is a
                  derivative of the Greek word ""ambrotos,"" meaning ""immortal,""
                  which combines the prefix ""a-"" (meaning ""not"") with 
""-mbrotos""
                  (meaning ""mortal""). In Greek and Roman mythology, only
                  immortals -- gods and goddesses -- could eat ambrosia. Those
                  mythological gods and goddesses also drank ""nectar,"" which, 
in
                  its original sense, refers to the ""drink of the gods."" 
(Even today,
                  you'll often find the words ""ambrosia"" and ""nectar"" in each
                  other's company.) While the ""ambrosia"" of the gods prevented
                  death, we mere mortals use ""ambrosia"" in reference to things
                  that just taste or smell especially delicious."

few hotties in Houston/Texas is that travel and exposure add such an 
intangible element to a person and very few Texas girls have experienced

lenient some more stringent.  At least that has been my experience.

,05/02/2000,,susan.scott@enron.com,,,Gallup answers,"Here is the quick & dirty.

None of the Gallup contracts contain a shipper out if the facilities are not 
placed in service by a certain date.  The respective obligations of the 
parties do not commence until the facilities are ""tested and placed in 
service.""  We notified our shippers by telephone yesterday that the 
facilities were in service.  The compressor has since been taken down because 
of excessive vibration and an unusual whining noise of undetermined origin.  
EE&CC does not know how long it will take to correct the problems; they do 
not have enough information yet to even give an estimate.  Based on our 
experience with Hubbard, it could take months to correct the problem.  Today, 
we've been able to deliver all nominated gas simply because noms did not 
exceed our existing capacity.  Nominations are expected to exceed existing 
capacity this week, in which case we will have to allocate.

Given the uncertainty involved, from a PR standpoint I believe it would be 
best to tell the customers that because of unforeseen circumstances we are 
not in service after all, that we apologize for the mistake and will do our 
best to provide service on a daily or interruptible basis.    When the 
compressor is actually tested and really in service, we'll let them know.  
The downside:  we get no reservation charge at all.  (estimated loss:  
$25,000/month)
The upside:  in the long run we probably save face with our customers.
revoke our ""in-service"" announcement.  When summer weather kicks in, we'll 
probably have to allocate every day.  On our EBB we will have to give some 
reason for the allocation (or if we don't, shippers will demand an 
explanation anyway).  Shippers' rights to a reservation refund will be 
triggered.  
The downside:  shippers will never trust us again.  Also, we could be subject 
to fraud or related causes of action for representing the compressor was ""in 
service"" when we knew it was not.  
The upside:  on the off chance no one files a lawsuit and wins, we might at 
least get to keep some of the reservation charges owed us, to the extent 
deliveries don't fall below 75% of nominated quantities for a period of 
longer than 75 days in months other than July and August this summer.  (In 
July and August, we don't get any reservation charge for amounts not 
delivered).  We just need to keep in mind that normally the pipeline runs 
full in the summer months, and Gallup capacity was sold with that assumption 
in mind.

Haven't had time to do a formal write-up; if you want me to turn this into a 
memo for wider distribution, let me know.  For now, I think it's important to 
get a decision on one of the above options.  The longer we wait to get 
information to our shippers, the bigger our customer relations problem will 
be."

probably been the final nail in the coffin.  

As far as the new job goes it is looking very promising.  Turns out my trader 
went to college with my brother-in-law, sister, and brother so we have too 
many mutual connections for him to be mean or rude to me.  Even without the 
connections he seems like a pretty cool guy and is very supportive of my 
learning all I can about his book.  Hopefully, after I get the daily routine 
down he'll let me sit with him during the down times and watch him work.

You should definitely try and see the film Saturday and even if you can't 
pull yourself out of bed you should rent it, I really think you would 
enjoy/be inspired by it (at least I am every time I watch it).  I hope things 
are well with you although I am sensing some disenchantment.  If that is the 
case I can give you a few tips on how to overcome and once again appreciate 
your current position in life.  Believe me over the last two months I have 
had ample opportunity to do just that.  Just let me know if I can return the

Pronunciation: 'al-tru-""i-z&m
Etymology: French altruisme, from autrui other people, from Old French, 
oblique case form of autre other, from Latin alter
Date: 1853
1 : unselfish regard for or devotion to the welfare of others

We got to talking about you at lunch today.  Rudy mentioned that in effort to 
get your goat he often tells you your not being very altruistic towards him 
by consuming
so much of his time requesting reports.  My understanding is that your 
typical response to this is ""I am the most altruistic person.""  I am sure you 
recognize the hypocrisy 
laden in this statement.  If a true altruist is unselfish then he would not 
care if his acts are recognized or not.  In fact, the true altruist hopes 
only that his acts benefit
those to which they are directed.  We may have to downgrade you to ""concerned 
individual"".                       

But given your good-hearted and idealistic leanings I thought you would might 
like to know that the Landmark River Oaks Theatre is going to be showing Mr. 
Smith 
Goes to Washington Saturday and Sunday at 10:00 a.m.  If you haven't seen the 
film it's a black and white starring Jimmy Stewart as an idealistic, 
extremely unselfish
young man who takes on the corrupt political machines of Washington, D.C.  
The film ranked 29th on AFI's (The American Film Institute) top 100 films of 
the Century list,
and is tied for first place on the Sscott5 Greatest Films List..

FYI- Neither you nor Nick have been removed from the group email, I simply 
haven't sent one out in the past two weeks.  I will make sure you both 
receive my next 
brilliant composition.  I must say I was tempted to remove you given your 
complaints about receiving all of the follow-up commentary and a lack of 
appearances."

piece.  My idea for the night is as follows, attend what I'm sure will be an 
outstanding performance, grab a late bite to eat at one of several excellent 
restaurants downtown (Mia Bella and Osteria D'Aldo come to mind) and polish 
off the evening by gracing one of the many hot-spots found downtown (Jones 
Bar, Swank Lounge, Deans, Mercury Room, etc.) with our presence.  Bear in 
mind that my plan is completely open to suggestions from each and every one 
of you.  While I realize such an early show may interfere with some people's
