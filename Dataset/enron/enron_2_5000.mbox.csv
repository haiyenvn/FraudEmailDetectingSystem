proceed with market readiness by the Fall of 2001.                          
As I indicated earlier to Richard, I have been invited to a meeting with 
several people from the Premier's office on Wednesday  May 2  to discuss the 
announcement ( I have asked Paul Devries to accompany me; representatives 
from Centrica, Toronto Hydro and Enersource/Mississauga Hydro will be there 
as well).                                        I had dinner with Judy 
Hubert (Asst Deputy Minister of Energy whom John met at Ken Lay's speech) on 
Thursday evening: she was aware of the pending meeting between Premier Harris 
and Mr. Lay  and was enquiring about what Mr. Lay wanted to address - I 
indicated that Mr. Lay would want to make the case for opening the market in 
the Fall of 2001(as set out in his speech) and to share with the Premier some 
proposals for moving the matter forward. I also indicated that Mr. Lay would 
be able to provide the Premier with a useful  and honest perspective on the 
events in California and that hopefully , on a going forward basis, the 
Premier would see Mr. Lay as someone he could phone and talk to about those 
issues.  I will sketch out a draft of the proposed speaking points early next 
week.

Eric, we are pretty sure the announcement will be that they will open the 
market by May 2002.  Today, senior political and bureaucratic staff in the 
Ministry of Energy have gone out of their way to stress that the announcement 
is designed to leave open the  real possibility of an earlier opening (i.e. 
in November 2001) if that is feasible.   As matters stand, I think that our 
response should be: a) We are pleased by the reaffirmation of the gov'ts 
intention to move forward with competition in the Ontario power market; b) 
our understanding of the position is that it leaves open the  real 
possibility of opening the market earlier, such as of November 1, 2001;  c) 
we continue to believe that an opening in November  2001 is feasible and in 
the best interests of Ontario (for the reasons set forth in Ken Lay's speech) 
; and  d) accordingly, we will continue to work towards a November opening 
and we encourage all others in the market  to do the 
same.                      Peter Varley of GPC is going to give you a call."

Attached is the link to a very good article that appeared in the National 
Post this morning.  The author, Terry Corcoran, is Canada's senior business 
writer and interviewed Ken Lay when he was here. You will see the references 
to Ken Lay and Enron.  Terry phoned me yesterday to indicate he had decided 
against running the piece today,  after a discussion with Dave Goulding, CEO 
of the IMO.   Goulding had evidently told him that there was no immediate 
urgency to  the gov't announcing a date.  Dave's concern is that if we press 
for a date now we may get the one we don't want (i.e. Spring 2002 rather than 
November 2001).  I told Corcoran that I understood Dave's concern but that 
there was a need for an early indication from the gov't  that they were 
targeting November in order that we maintain momentum among those bodies 
(primarily the distributors) which bear the primary responsibility to get the 
needed systems in place.  Eric Thode is forwarding a copy to John L.

proponent of a major project- though many are skeptical ) have evidently told 
the Ministry of Energy that they are comfortable with a Spring 2002 opening.  
This is not helpful because generation investment has been key to the gov't's 
message re the benefits of competition.   The Minister has been using the 
alleged Sithe position to counter the argument that a Fall opening is 
critical to sustaining momentum and investment in the Ontario power 
sector.    I know the Sithe person here and he is very ornery (the former 
Chair of IPPSO) . I know that we have a major commercial arrangement with 
Sithe in the US.   Is there any one in Houston (Lay, Lavorato, Delainey) who 
can lever a more supportive position out of Sithe.                     With 
respect to the last point in my attached memo, I am wondering whether we 
could lever some senior US official to draw attention to the enormous profits 
that BC Hydro made in California and use this to make a case for reciprocity  
- ""If you want access to our markets, you better open up Yours as soon as 
possible"".  (Best do this in advance of Lay's meeting with the Premier).   I 
think the point is more obviously made re BC than OPG but  the point would 
not be lost on OPG which had revenues in excess of CAD $279,000,000 in 2000  
on 4.0TWh.   Most, if not all of that, of that would be from US markets.   In 
the absence of a FERC marketer authorization, all OPG physical transactions 
are done at the border.   In NY, even those border transactions require OPG 
to be a member of the NY ISO.  In order to become a member of the NY ISO, OPG 
had to get a waiver of the tariif provision re reciprocity.  They got  an 
extension of that waiver from the Management Committee  earlier this year 
only after a speech by Dave Goulding of the IMO to the Members Committee that 
the Ontario market would open this year.   That waiver will expire at the end 
of this year.   So OPG must understand that there is a serious risk that the 
waiver will not be extended if the market is not opened in accordance with 
Goulding's assurances.

Just wanted to give you some updates from my presentation in Toronto.

1. I used alot of material from Lay's speech.  Changed it a little.  I think 
I did ok (although I referenced airline competition in Canada - something you 
guys haven't yet put in place).

2. The general tone of the day was that Ontario has some more work to do.  It 
doesn't appear that the parties were really ready to move ahead with 
competition.  California wasn't discussed too much.  Many people are worried 
that the rules don't really promote competition - which they don't.

3. OPG indicated at lunch that they want competition, but that it was up to 
the parties in the meeting to make it happen.  Most people were in agreement 
(quietly).

Given the huge value loss for ENA if we don't get it open, I'd like to know 
if there is anything else we can do to help you.   There are some new 
Competitive Analysis guys that may be able to help us find some leverage - 
pls give me a call.  Finally, I saw Lavorato in the airport on the way back 
to Houston.  He is ready to help and recognizes the importance of this 
activity.  I think that he can get Lay and/or Skilling whenever through the 
Summer.

If you can push this through, this is a huge win for Government Affairs.  
This is easily the biggest Regulatory Origination opportunity we have this 
year.

Alberta.   When the election was called the governing Progressive 
Conservative Party led by Ralph Klein held a strong majority of 63 of the 83 
seats in our Provincial Legislature.   The Liberals had 18 seats and the New 
Democrats (socialist) had 2 seats.

The two issues that dominated the election campaign were: #1 health care, and 
#2 electricity restructuring.   The PC's faced considerable criticism 
regarding their handling of restructuring.   The Liberals came out with a 
policy platform on electricity restructuring that envisioned the government 
taking back the PPAs ""by negotiation or legislation, if necessary"" at a price 
below market and using this supply to provide cost-based power to residential 
and commercial customers.  Only customers with load greater than 5 MW would 
be exposed to market prices.  The ND's policy platform was to scrap 
electricity deregulation entirely.  

Throughout the campaign the PC's defended their electricity restructuring 
policy and pledged to continue to protect Alberta consumers from the effects 
of rising natural gas and electricity prices.  To date, this protection has 
taken the form of natural gas and electricity rebate payments funded from the 
sale of the PPA's and from the provincial treasury.

I'm pleased to report the PC's enjoyed a landslide victory last night that 
appeared to even surprise them.  They increased their number of seats to 74 
of the 83 seats in our Legislature while the Liberals were reduced to 7 seats 
and the ND's retained the 2 seats they had.   With this new and significant 5 
year mandate, I am optimistic the PC Government will now be less focused on 
depressing short-term wholesale power prices and will be more prepared to 
focus on longer-term policy decisions and initiatives that will: i) attract 
new generation, iii) attract new retailers, and iii) give electricity 
restructuring a chance to actually deliver on the benefits it promised.    

We are well positioned to influence the Alberta Government going forward and 
I will be requesting further internal and external resources to help me 
develop and communicate our market design proposals further.   If Enron can 
help Alberta overcome the serious supply and retail market problems it 
presently faces, I can see a day when Alberta is held out as an electricity 
restructuring success story.

Rob, after extended negotiations with British Energy, we have verbally 
settled on:

1.  Contract drop dead date extended to December 31, 2002
2.  Contract price of C$ 41.85/MWh.
3.  A number of small amendments to the contract that we (Chris and I) are OK 
with (Chris is preparing an Amending Agreement and memo for Peter Keohane to 
review tomorrow).

I am very happy with this as it still leaves a value of C$ 107 million (US$ 
71.3 million), and it extends the contract out 13 months from the current 
drop dead.  They were initially at C$45/MWh so we were able to squeeze them 
down a fair bit.  Realistically, there was a fair chance of not getting any 
of this power as they would only have had to give Falconbridge or Dofasco or 
any industrial a call and been able to fill this at $45/MWh in a heartbeat.  
Fortunately they still see value in having a contract with us for the future 
opportunities that may come up in the marketplace.   

We have left the discussion of the put swaptions from Bruce A to a later date.

With respect to point 1 in your  memo, my sense is that the counterparty

not  go forward and be implemented unless it had the support of OPG.  The 
question we should talk through  is how do we best try to get that support 
from OPG.                                        With respect to point 2, I 
think we should be careful about being  too encouraged by Wilson's 
/Purchase's comments  to Lay/Lavorato on June 19 that if positive reports are 
delivered by the IMO and OEB in September, the gov't  will be hard pressed 
not to move forward.  My concern is that Wilson and Purchase may feel 
comfortable saying this precisely because they are expecting a negative 
report from the OEB (or at least one that they can interpret as being 
negative). I agree with you that the likelihood of the IMO delivering a 
positive report is very good. The likelihood of a positive report from the 
OEB is far less certain. The key issues  at the OEB/retail level are EBT, LDC 
access to the data they need from HydroOne, completion of LDC CIS systems,  
the gov't's interest in an industry resolution of  customer duplications 
prior to market opening in order to avoid mass confusion in the initial 
period of the market, the  state of customer education, and a contingency 
plan to accommodate those who are not ready.                                - 
with respect to EBT, I think the best we can do is get onside quickly with 
our  EBT hub of choice  and work with them on perceived difficulties   with 
LDCs, etc.  Ellis, Marryott and I are going to make a recommendation to Paul 
next week on our preferred EBT hub.                          -with respect to 
the info from HydroOne, I  have already raised this issue with the OEB and 
the IMO. The OEB and the IMO subsequently met with   HydroOne and the MEA in 
an effort to resolve this issue.  My understanding, until yesterday's 
discussion with Conway, was that the issue was resolved  and the information 
was now flowing to the LDCs. Paul, Garrett  and I are meeting senior HydroOne 
execs (including Rod Taylor) on Monday re       resource adequacy issues and 
we can press this with them as well.                               - with 
respect to the CIS issue, there is not much we can do since most  LDCs 
already have a CIS vendor; but my understanding is that at least   one CIS 
vendor has backed out of its commitments to a number of LDCs recently (per 
David MacFadden) and perhaps we can get a vendor   to move in quickly to fill 
that gap. I will raise this with Marryott to see what may be feasible at this 
stage.                           - with respect to the customer duplication 
issue, I have already met with the senior people at Direct (last week)  to 
discuss this issue with them and to  propose a resolution that would see the 
retailers involved retaining a third party  (such as E&Y)  to assess the 
degree of overlap and whether   there was an acceptable solution to any 
problem. Direct is convinced that the degree of duplication is not high.  
Direct is talking to Onsource   and Toronto about this.  I am checking with 
our staff in the UK about whether there was a similar issue when the UK 
market opened and, if so, how it was  resolved. 
.                                      -with respect to customer education, I 
and Dick Perdue (Direct's advisor) have contacted TransAlta, OPG, HydroOne, 
Onsource, Enersource,   and Toronto about funding a  Province- wide consumer 
education initiative over the summer.  We are meeting next week to discuss 
this idea    further.  This could require a financial commitment from Enron 
of  up to $200,000.                              - with respect to the 
contingency plan to deal with those LDCs who are not ready, the OEB is 
already on side in recognizing the need for a contingency  plan - it will 
likely be very simple: the IMO  would send a bill to the LDC each month and 
the LDC would bill customers at some fixed rate, with a deferral  account). 
The key  issue will be how many LDCs (in terms of numbers and size)  are not 
ready and what is the minimum number of LDCs that   the OEB/gov't is looking 
for to be ready. This is an issue we will have to talk to the MEST about as 
well as the OEB , since ultimately the    decision of whether enough LDCs are 
ready will be a political one.                             These are the 
OEB/retail focussed things we are doing.  On the  larger political front, I 
have several  ideas about some things  I would like to do that I can discuss 
with you and Paul.

Dave, Here is my response to the concerns raised in your e-mail below
regarding exports from Ontario to the connected US markets:
 
? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?a) Remember that the rules and policies under
development at the IMO will ensure that load in Ontario will not be cut in
order to support export transactions (in other words, Ontario, like most US
systems, has adopted a ""native load"" preference).
 
? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? b) Remember also that the Ontario market
clearing price will be set by the offers and bids within Ontario.
Scheduled external demand will move us up the bid stack but cannot, for
instance, set the Ontario price by offering ?lets say ?$1,000 MWh. The
price paid by all internal and external ?load (leaving aside the issue of
congestion) will ? ?be set by the marginal bid in Ontario.
 
? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? c)
Remember also that the scope for ?economic export transactions will be
limited by the impact of the export and wheeling tariff ?($1 MWh),
liability for uplift (estimated at approximately ?$4 ?MWh), and the IMO
administration fee (estimated at $1MWh), ?plus any wheeling/admin charges
applied by the connected markets.
 
? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? d)
Perhaps most importantly, remember that congestion costs will be charged in
respect of export transactions from the Ontario zone (assume low cost) to
an external intertie zone (assume high cost). A buyer from the Ontario spot
market in the external intertie zone will pay the aggregate of the Ontario
market clearing price plus the applicable congestion costs. Those
congestion costs are calculated as the difference between the Ontario price
(low cost) and the price in the external zone (high cost). ?Two
features/implications of this regime are worth noting. First, the liability
to pay congestion costs will by itself reduce the scope for export
transactions of the scope and level you fear. (Though one can buy
transmission rights - TRs - which will provide a complete hedge against
congestion costs.) ?Second, the congestion costs collected under this
regime will, after funding the hedge held by the holders of TRs, be applied
to reduce the revenue requirement of the transmission owners. ?(In other
words, the surplus flows back to reduce the transmission rates that Ontario
consumers would otherwise pay).
 
? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? Hope this
helps you and your colleagues on the PACE. ?Happy to answer any other
questions that you may have.

Aleck: ?Thanks for getting back to me so quickly. ?One point that I forgot
to mention was the impact of external demand.
 
At the same time that Ontario generators would be trying to sell into
higher priced US markets, marketers serving US customers would be trying to
buy lower cost power in Ontario to ship south. ?As you pointed out, both
groups would need to take into account the costs of wheeling and exporting
the power. ?However, if the price differential between the Ontario and US
markets was sufficient to offset these costs, electricity would flow to the
US until the price differential for delivered power was eliminated. ?If
demand exceeded supply in the US market by an amount equal to or larger
than the US intertie capacity, and Ontario was the lowest-cost supply
alternative, the total demand for Ontario power (from native and foreign
sources) could exceed Ontario supply under extreme weather (as shown in the
table below). ?Under these conditions, the price in Ontario would be bid up
by the US market imbalance. ?Alberta would have had a similar problem with
its BC intertie, if it hadn't decoupled its market pricing so that the
market clearing price for Albertans is set only by local demand.
 
A second and perhaps more critical issue, is the technical capability of
the Ontario market. ?Despite the rosy reports from the IMO, some market
participants have experienced IMO failures during testing and most MEUs
have indicated that they cannot be ready for a November opening. ?Many
people feel that the risk of system failure must be eliminated or reduced
to a manageable insignificant level, before the market can be opened.
 
I would appreciate any additional thoughts you care to share on these
points.
 
Thanks,
 
Dave

David, here are some observations in response to your questions: a) You are
correct that we would expect Ontario-based generators to pursue economic
export opportunities in the connected US markets but we stress that the
economics of such exports will be affected not only by the comparative
generation costs, but also the cost of Hydro One's export and wheeling
tariff, the IMO uplift and related charges charged to all load (including
exports), transmission costs in the connected market, and any congestion
costs arising in the event that the intertie between Ontario and the
connected market is congested. ?Everything else being equal, this means
that on average, power will trade within Ontario at a discount to prices in
the U S connected markets. b) With respect to volatility, it has to be
conceded that electricity is the most volatile of commodities. Having said
that, the period of most serious volatility is the summer months. Moreover,
we think it can be fairly said that volatility and price swings are
moderating in the Eastern Interconnect largely as a consequence of the
decrease in fuel costs (i.e. natural gas prices) ?and extensive new
generation build - PIRA estimates that in Summer 2001 the year to year
increase in ?available generation resources in the Eastern Interconnect is
about 30,000MW. This all adds up to increased price stability. ? Again, my
colleague, Garrett Tripp, and I would be ready to meet with your group at
any time to go over these questions and our analysis in more detail. ?Give
me a call if you would like to meet to discuss these points. ? 416 865

Thanks for the report. ?It helped to validate the PACE conclusion that
there is sufficient supply to open the market without precipitating another
California.
 
The report mentions that imports would not set the MCP in Ontario and that
energy savings would be possible even if peak market demand was met by
imports, while in another section it concludes that Ontario could rely on
higher-priced imports to meet demand. ? The first two points seem to
contradict the results from the IMO test runs, which indicate that the US
markets will set the clearing price in Ontario 90 percent of the time,
putting upward pressure on electricity prices in our market. ?If prices are
higher in the adjacent markets, Ontario generators can be expected to
export power to the more lucrative markets rather than bidding into the
Ontario market, resulting in higher prices for Ontario since prices are
determined on the margin. ?Price volatility and extreme price swings were
also identified as concerns by MEUs.
 
Were any of these concerns addressed in your presentation and are there any
comments you can share?"

		 Subject: RE: Lay/Harris Meeting

Rob, just to reiterate one point Paul and I were  trying to make on   our 
conference call  - We both  think it would be a  mistake to delete from the 
discussion with Harris et al  our views regarding prices and resource 
adequacy.  The biggest political  fear of the gov't going forward is that 
consumers will see a big jump in prices once the market opens.  For 
instance,  that fear underlies  the suggestion that  market opening should 
await the return to service of the first Pickering A unit.  - the idea (right 
or wrong)  is that Pickering will provide  greater reliability and price 
stability. The biggest fear  of the  government - based on our discussions 
with the politicians and their advisors  - is  the prospect of headlines in 
the Toronto Star et al about high prices in the IMO markets, whether or not a 
rebate is ultimately payable down the road. They saw the problems that  high 
prices posed for Klein earlier this year and are fearful of being caught in 
the same position. The Harris gov't is far more vulnerable than Klein  ever 
was.   We are concerned that it  is not an adequate answer to the gov't's 
political concerns  to say that high prices will simply increase the cashflow 
to the government's own coffers (via OPG) to be redistributed at some later 
date to  Ontario electricity consumers.  Remember that, in any event,  the 
MPMA rebate is calculated on the basis of annual revenues and that estimates 
are that consumers may not see an MPMA  payout until six months after the end 
of the year.  Our own extensive analysis and our own forward curves for 
Ontario indicate that significant price increases  (compared to the new OPG 
bulk power rate of $48 MWh ) are unlikely.  This is a reassuring assessment 
and we think it is important to share that view with gov't.   We can't rely 
entirely on the existence of the mitigants; we have to address the underlying 
concern about price spikes and high prices.  We think we have a good story to 
tell in that regard.  Pleased to talk about this further.  Aleck

He was very impressed by Garrett's presentation.  His comments were as 
follows:  a) the mood in gov't is changing; b)  the  political environment 
several months ago (California, high gas prices, and complaining industrials) 
made it very difficult for the gov't to be making a decision at that time  to 
move forward with market opening; c) Enron's message  has been getting

moderated considerably: the differences from California are understood, gas

		 Subject: RE: IMO Meeting Highlights

Aleck, re OPG and Pickering - too complicated of a message re Harris meeting. 
As per Lavo, he wants 5 simple/straightforward and concise messages that we 
can get accross to Harris. It needs to be short, to the point, concise, and 
simple. By cc to Paul, Lavo is looking for our first draft TODAY (you and 
Aleck need to agree on the speaking points - I provided you with my comments 
already). 

One further Item re the IMO Meeting that I didnt have time to communcicate to 
you - At one point in the meeting Guolding stated that if one industrial or 
one muni is not ready - the market will not open. I lost my mind, and told 
him that if that is the case, I need to resign as this is a complete waste of 
time and the market will never open if our CEO is telling the marketplace 
that one rinky-dink muni can hold the entire market opening hostage. Without 
doubt, it was the most frustrating/disappointing statement I've seen 
Guolding/Baillie make - I'm sure Houghton was basking in all his glory after 
that. I almost want to write a letter specific to guoulding and cc'd to 
Baillie underlining who ridiculous a position this is for the CEO of the IMO 
to be taking."
,05/11/2001,,sasha.jacob@gpcinternational.com,"aleck.dadson@enron.com, rshapiro@enron.com",,Ontario Premier's Office Meetings,"Aleck & Richard:

Just a quick update following my meetings yesterday in the Premier's Office.

Without question, the majority of decision-makers were leaning strongly
towards announcing a firm Spring 2002 opening date.

It has been conveyed to me that our (Enron/GPC) efforts prior to the
announcement by the Minister made a significant impact on the softening of
the announcement, making May 2002 a deadline and leaving the possibility for
a November opening.  While other stakeholders were advocating a November
opening (also largely thanks to the Enron/GPC effort, e.g. Board of Trade),
their arguments did not provide the same technical persuasiveness (with
concerns such as those regarding supply) as the Enron effort.  This
expertise coupled with sensitivity towards the political needs and pressures
resulted in an argument that surpassed those being made by some of the
industrials.

Recent comments by the Minister and others also suggest that the
government's message may change to ""working towards November"".  The
Lay/Harris meeting, our ongoing efforts to mitigate the influence of market
opening opponents, and our efforts to persuade decision-makers that the four
conditions have been met should help us meet our objectives.

Economics 90210

Peter Foster
National Post
Dumb ol' Dubya. President Bush and his administration have been taken to task 
this week by U.S. liberal economists and media sophisticates for being so 
naive as to suggest that California's problems won't be solved by price 
controls. That, sniffed last Sunday's New York Times, was just ""Econ 101."" 
What the President needed was a lesson in Econ 90210, presented by the 
Department of Sarah Polley-Sci.
The bad news for Californians is that the shift of power to the democrats in 
the federal Senate means that price controls become more likely, and with 
them more blackouts. Meanwhile, the real causes of the California crisis -- a 
screwed-up deregulation process exacerbated by environmentalist opposition to 
new state power plants -- are buried beneath screams about gouging and 
profiteering, and calls for an anti-corporate witch hunt.
The call for price caps has allegedly been boosted by the support of a ""gang 
of ten"" economists including Alfred Kahn, ""the architect of airline 
deregulation under President Carter."" But price caps don't work. As President 
Bush noted after meeting California Governor Gray Davis last week, ""[P]rice 
caps do nothing to reduce demand and they do nothing to increase supply."" 
However, according to another liberal economist, Princeton's Paul Krugman, we 
shouldn't worry about prices because this summer will see blackouts anyway, 
and in the longer term, new supplies are on the way via new plants, whose 
arrival will somehow be magically impervious to the prospect of controls.
Apart from being terrible economics, Mr. Krugman's attitude is even more 
objectionable politics. At least he is frank about the reasoning behind his 
support for price caps. They are intended to keep money out of the hands of 
power suppliers. Meanwhile, he pursues the conceit -- disproven time and time 
again -- that prices can be fine-tuned by bureaucrats to a level that will be 
""just enough"" to call forth the right amount of new power. ""Nobody,"" he 
writes, ""has proposed capping prices at a level that would prevent power 
producers from making extraordinarily high profits; why should this reduce 
the power supply?""
Mr. Krugman suggests that students who go beyond naive old Econ 101 learn 
that ""strictly speaking, the standard argument against price controls applies 
only to competitive industry. A price ceiling imposed on a monopolist need 
not cause a shortage; indeed, price controls on a monopolist can actually 
lead to higher output."" This happens when the guy in the top hat throws up 
his hands and says ""No point in me holding out for higher prices now that you 
clever wonks have capped them, so just come in and take what you want. And 
which way is it to the airport?""
Professor Krugman does have the good grace to note that ""That's not an 
argument you want to use too often."" In fact, the argument is dangerous 
nonsense. There is no ""monopoly"" supplier of energy to California (although 
many state politicians have called for a government takeover of the 
""commanding heights"" of electricity generation, . la Lenin). Moreover, both 
the economic and political arguments against price caps remain as valid as 
ever. Price spikes require a buyer as well as a seller. To hold down prices 
means that there will be excess demand and that constrained supply will have 
to be allocated among competing uses by politicians and bureaucrats -- as it 
was under the system of natural gas price and transportation controls that 
brought the United States to crisis back in 1977. Meanwhile, the impact of 
such essentially arbitrary controls goes well beyond their immediate skewing 
of market signals. They damage the entire investment climate by raising the 
spectre of further whimsical intervention, and by establishing an effective 
ceiling to profitability without any corresponding limits to losses, except 
for those with political pull. Professor Krugman asserts that ""generating 
capacity is being added so quickly that the industry will soon face a glut."" 
If that happens, we may be sure that Mr. Krugman will not be calling for 
price supports.
Mr. Krugman has been a leader among the baying pack that suggests that 
California's problems are all due to market ""manipulation"" by big energy 
suppliers. He concludes his display of economic obfuscation with the snide 
assertion that President Bush's ""knee-jerk ideologue"" advisers may be ""so 
close personally to energy industry executives that they believe that 
whatever is good for Enron is good for America."" The presence in California 
of Enron, the world's largest energy trader, has increased supplies to the 
state, but according to California's attorney general, democrat Bill Lockyer, 
Enron's head, Kenneth Lay, should be sent to jail. After all, he did raise 
campaign funds for George Bush. And price caps and jail for business 
executives somehow go together nicely."

		 Subject: Ken Lay/John Lavorato Briefing Material

 I have attached the following: a) a high level outline of the speaking 
points for Ken Lay and John Lavorato for their meetings with Premier Harris 
and, I hope, Wilson, Purchase and Hubert;  and  b) a more detailed briefing 
note which outlines:   i) key developments since April 4 ,   ii) our position 
re market opening and the key issues that have been raised against opening 
the market this Fall, iii) differences between California and Ontario; and 
iv) Enron's assessment of the possible difficulties in NYC this Summer.  I am 
awaiting material from Houston to complete the piece on 
NYC.                         One piece that I think needs to be added to the 
detailed briefing note is an overview of Enron's current commercial position 
in Ontario - i.e. the renegotiation of the BE contract and the likelihood of 
pursuing a retail initiative.  You will see where I have left space for that 
piece, hoping that you could draft it.                     I have endeavoured 
in the outline of the speaking points to focus on what we know the key 
issues/concerns for  the government are at this stage.                      I 
have asked Sasha Jacob to provide us with profiles of Harris, Wilson, 
Purchase and Hubert to include in the final briefing package.                 
       I have prepared the material on the assumption that the best use of 
the meeting time (likely 45 minutes with Harris and 60 minutes with Wilson et 
al)  is: a)  to make  the  case for proceeding with market opening this Fall 
if the IMO and OEB reports re market readiness are positive;  b) to provide 
Harris et al with our perspective on developments in the U.S. (particularly 
New York and California) about which the government may have continuing 
concerns; and c) to ask Harris what we can do to help the gov't move forward 
to a market opening this year.                              Rick Shapiro left 
me a voice mail indicating that Lavorato and he had spoken about the visit 
and the supporting material. The agreement  between the two of them is 
evidently  that  Rob, you and I are  all to be comfortable with the briefing 
material before sending it to John, who will then review it and propose any 
changes he feels are necessary before it is forwarded to Ken 
Lay.                                 I would appreciate your questions, 
comments and suggested revisions.

Aleck and I have recently discussed the prospect of adding another individual to our Canadian team based in Calgary and Aleck invited me to prepare a description of the need and our circumstances for your review.   

I understand Derek Davies and Rob Milnthorp spoke to John Lavorato about the need for additional support for our PPA exposure last week. They tell me that John agreed with them that we need additional transmission rate design experience in-house in Calgary given we are exposed through our PPA position to considerable transmission rate risk.  From Derek's and Rob's perspective, the dedication of an additional individual to assist in managing outstanding transmission rate related matters that have not yet been addressed (and other issues that impact the value of our PPA) could be conservatively quantified as in excess of $Cdn 80 million over the 20 year life of the PPA.  While this person does not necessarily have to be in the Government Affairs Group, my sense is that our group would be a much better fit than having the person join our commercial group. 

Background

The Alberta Conservatives were re-elected with a significant majority in March 2001 and is now in the early years of a new four year mandate.  The new Minister of Energy has reaffirmed the vision and commitment of the Alberta Government to electricity restructuring which started to a limited degree in 1996 with the deregulation of generation and the creation of a power pool and transmission administrator.  Effective Jan 1, 2001 the formerly regulated generation was sold in the form of Power Purchase Arrangements and retail customer choice for all classes of electricity customers was introduced.  

In late August 2000 Enron Canada purchased the 705 MW Sundance B PPA in the PPA Auction for an up front price of $Cdn 300 million and assumption of the fixed and variable costs over the 20 year (starting Jan 1, 2001) remaining base life of units 3 and 4 of the Sundance B Power Plant of approximately $Cdn 2 billion.  The Sundance Power Plant is owned by TransAlta Corporation and located west of Edmonton in central Alberta.  

In Q2 2001 Enron Canada launched Enron Direct in Alberta which is a retail supplier of natural gas and electricity whose initial target market is commercial customers of all sizes.  Enron Direct recently began operating in Ontario and will initially serve the same market segment as the Alberta operation.  Enron Direct's initial business plan does not involve serving residential customers but it is expected that Enron Direct will expand its target market to include these customers within 1-2 years. 

Current Government Affairs Coverage

Fino Tiberi joined the Government Affairs team on May 15, 2001 and his focus has been on dealing with market design and implementation issues that impact the risk profile and profitability of Enron Direct's retail electricity and gas business in Alberta.  In particular, the Alberta electricity retail market is in the very early stages of development and the first 9 months of operation have revealed some significant design flaws in the initial settlement process that have implications for Enron Direct.  In addition, other issues need to be addressed such as: exit fees, unreasonable distribution tariffs, lack of oversight of municipal utilities.  The government has indicated that one of its top priorities is address the problems with the present retail market design.  Fino has also had some limited involvement in supporting Enron Direct's retail initiative in Ontario and has recently began investigating the current status of the retail gas market in BC with a view to advising Enron Direct on the requirements for entry and the market design issues that must be addressed.  

It is reasonable to assess the task of influencing retail market design and providing information/support to Enron Direct's commercial staff in Alberta and Ontario as requiring Fino's full time attention for the next 2 years.

Since Fino's arrival, my focus has primarily been on providing input and comments to the Alberta Government, Power Pool of Alberta, Transmission Administrator and AEUB on wholesale electricity matters and to a lesser extent some retail gas matters (unbundling, code of conduct).  In addition, I have been working closely with the Enron Canada commercial and legal groups on numerous issues that impact the value of, or relate to commercial opportunities arising out of, the Sundance B PPA position.  This includes issues such as: Alberta Government approval to split the Sundance B PPA into two smaller PPAs for resale by Enron Canada, treatment of the unsold PPAs, transmission congestion issues, transmission tariff issues, energy import/export rules, power pool rule changes.  Transmission issues are of particular interest to Enron given Alberta's unique transmission rate design regime under which suppliers in Alberta pay 50% of the transmission revenue requirement.  Many of these issues are complex and in many cases the implications of their outcome impact Enron Canada's Sundance PPA position by millions of dollars.  For example, Enron Canada is leading a coalition of PPA Buyers (Derek Davies and I will be on the PPA Buyer Coalition witness panel) that is presently involved in an AEUB hearing to contest the STS rate schedule proposed by the Transmission Administrator that, if approved, will have the effect of requiring the PPA Buyers to pay for transmission capacity that is used solely by the PPA Owners for their own financial benefit.  Enron Canada estimates the value of it prevailing in this application over the 20 year life of the PPA is approximately $Cdn 60 million.  

Staffing Requirements and External Resources Going Forward

A number of key wholesale market issues are yet to be debated and resolved such as: transmission congestion, the consolidation of the TA and Power Pool, the role of the Balancing Pool in managing the unsold PPAs, the future design of the transmission tariff (i.e. whether generator's should continue to pay one half of the costs of the deep/bulk transmission system), export/import transmission access, power pool price caps and other distortionary pool rules such as those that exclude importers from setting pool price, authority of the market surveillance administrator, and amendments to the Electric Utilities Act in spring 2002.  

My initial plan was to manage these issues myself and rely on the approval of RCR's to obtain ongoing support from the team of  external consultants I have worked with (TCA, Frontier, Altitude Energy) to assist me in circumstances where the issues are technically complex and/or where I am unable to commit the time necessary to develop Enron's position/input on an issue.  This has worked, but it is clear that given the scope, complexity, and number of the issues in Alberta that we must be involved in given the value at risk of our Sundance PPA position, it can reasonably be concluded that the cost of these resources over the next two years will far exceed the cost of a full time Director level Government Affairs staff member familiar with the Alberta electricity market design and more specifically the Power Pool and Transmission Administrator designs (including the TA's rates and tariff).  In addition, these consultants are much less accessible to our commercial staff than a full-time employee.   

I anticipate the most substantial changes in the Alberta electricity market design will occur over the next 2 years as this is the period during which the Government itself, and via pressure on the institutions it oversees (AEUB, Power Pool, TA), will implement changes with a view to then leaving a period of two full years prior to the next provincial election for the market to respond.  There is a clear need for at least this period of time for full-time coverage of Alberta electricity issues alone.  

Proposed Individual

Randy Stubbings is currently Director, Regulatory Affairs, at ESBI Alberta Limited (the Transmission Administrator) and is responsible for the TA's filings before the AEUB.  I have known Randy for approximately 4 years and have found him to be an intelligent and reasonable individual who is well respected by the Government, AEUB, and other industry participants. Randy is capable of providing immediate and valuable advice and input in the development of Enron Canada's participation in the transmission related matters that could impact Enron Canada, including the STS Rate Schedule issue (the hearing will resume on Nov 19).  His technical background and experience along with his long term involvement in various Alberta electricity market issues would be of significant and immediate benefit to Enron Canada's commercial group.  Derek Davies has had some limited dealings with Randy (and has watched Randy as one of EAL's witnesses at the STS hearing) and has been impressed with his knowledge and expertise.  

Randy called me recently to advise that he was interested in leaving ESBI and thought Enron would be a challenging and interesting place to work.  He advised that the current salary (including bonus) for a person of his level at ESBI is between $Cdn 120,000 - 140,000.  If the position is approved, I would propose we not proceed through the normal recruiting process but rather immediately have Randy meet firstly with Aleck and I, then with Derek Davies, Rob Milnthorp and myself, and then with Rick Shapiro, Harry Kingerski, Jim Steffes (in person or by video conference) Aleck and I.  I invited Randy to forward a copy of his CV to me.

The Liberal Party has asked me whether Enron (really someone like Rob Milnthorp or Paul Devries) might consider being the co-chair of a fund raising event for the party in November 2001. The event would be timed for the Independent Power Producers Society of Ontario conference (the largest annual energy conference in Canada) and would be targeted at people in the Ontario energy sector. Dalton McGuinty, the leader, would speak at the event.  I didn't dismiss the idea out of hand because it may have merit if : a)  through such an event, we can secure true bipartisan support for moving forward.  (In other words, if we were to do this, the material would have to state that Rob or Paul is acting as co-chair in recognition of the bipartisan support for the deregulation initiative and how such bipartisan support is good for the Province etc); and b) we were satisfied that doing so would not alienate the governing Conservatives.

Trade Electricity Taskforce meeting this morning:                          a) 
On the weekend, May 4- 6, the Ontario Chamber of Commerce unanimously adopted 
the Toronto Board of Trade's  position paper re market opening on November 1, 
2001.   The OCC is the umbrella organization of all local chambers of 
commerce/ boards of trade across Ontario.  The Toronto Board of Trade 
position paper largely follows the Enron position paper re market 
opening.                              b) Elyse Allan, Louise Verity and Jan 
Carr (all representing the Toronto Board of Trade) met with Minister Wilson 
and Judy Hubert on Tuesday, May 8. Wilson explicitly asked the BOT to ""keep 
up the heat"" on a November 1 opening. Wilson was evidently very impressed by 
the OCC resolution.                       c) Some concern was expressed  by 
David McFadden (head of SAC and BE's lawyer)   that  OPG may not put the 
fossil units on the block until August, since the Ministry of the 
Environment's new emissions regulations will not be promulgated until that 
time.  Paul might want to raise this with Gord Homer: I don't see why OPG 
would have to wait until August  to begin the process; the substance of the 
regs are known now, even if they are not law until 
August.                       d) A fight is brewing between the City of 
Toronto and the Province regarding the Hearn facility.  The City wants to 
tear it down  as part of their waterfront plan but the Province is pushing to 
keep it as a generation facility of some type. The IMO has evidently prepared 
a report on the issue that has not yet been made 
public.                                        e)There was a push from some 
taskforce members (particularly Jan Carr) to adopt, as a transitional 
measure, some type of controls to limit exports and control prices in 
Ontario.  This was a non-starter with most of the members of the taskforce 
and that initiative will not go forward. I have undertaken, instead,  to give 
the BOT some talking points that they can use in answering questions about  
interregional trade and the type of comments that Howard Hampton  (NDP 
leader) is making about the US sucking cheap power out of Ontario."

With respect to point 1 in your  memo, my sense is that the counterparty would have to be either OPG or OEFC.  In my view, the concept would not/could not  go forward and be implemented unless it had the support of OPG.  The question we should talk through  is how do we best try to get that support from OPG. 																																							With respect to point 2, I think we should be careful about being  too encouraged by Wilson's /Purchase's comments  to Lay/Lavorato on June 19 that if positive reports are delivered by the IMO and OEB in September, the gov't  will be hard pressed not to move forward.  My concern is that Wilson and Purchase may feel comfortable saying this precisely because they are expecting a negative report from the OEB (or at least one that they can interpret as being negative). I agree with you that the likelihood of the IMO delivering a positive report is very good. The likelihood of a positive report from the OEB is far less certain. The key issues  at the OEB/retail level are EBT, LDC access to the data they need from HydroOne, completion of LDC CIS systems,  the gov't's interest in an industry resolution of  customer duplications prior to market opening in order to avoid mass confusion in the initial period of the market, the  state of customer education, and a contingency plan to accommodate those who are not ready.  																														- with respect to EBT, I think the best we can do is get onside quickly with our  EBT hub of choice  and work with them on perceived difficulties 		with LDCs, etc.  Ellis, Marryott and I are going to make a recommendation to Paul next week on our preferred EBT hub.  																								-with respect to the info from HydroOne, I  have already raised this issue with the OEB and the IMO. The OEB and the IMO subsequently met with 		HydroOne and the MEA in an effort to resolve this issue.  My understanding, until yesterday's discussion with Conway, was that the issue was resolved 	and the information was now flowing to the LDCs. Paul, Garrett  and I are meeting senior HydroOne execs (including Rod Taylor) on Monday re     		resource adequacy issues and we can press this with them as well. 																														- with respect to the CIS issue, there is not much we can do since most  LDCs already have a CIS vendor; but my understanding is that at least 		one CIS vendor has backed out of its commitments to a number of LDCs recently (per David MacFadden) and perhaps we can get a vendor 		to move in quickly to fill that gap. I will raise this with Marryott to see what may be feasible at this stage. 																										- with respect to the customer duplication issue, I have already met with the senior people at Direct (last week)  to discuss this issue with them and to 	propose a resolution that would see the retailers involved retaining a third party  (such as E&Y)  to assess the degree of overlap and whether 		there was an acceptable solution to any problem. Direct is convinced that the degree of duplication is not high.  Direct is talking to Onsource 		and Toronto about this. 	I am checking with our staff in the UK about whether there was a similar issue when the UK market opened and, if so, how it was 	resolved. . 																																					-with respect to customer education, I and Dick Perdue (Direct's advisor) have contacted TransAlta, OPG, HydroOne, Onsource, Enersource, 		and Toronto about funding a  Province- wide consumer education initiative over the summer.  We are meeting next week to discuss this idea 		 further.  This could require a financial commitment from Enron of  up to $200,000. 																													- with respect to the contingency plan to deal with those LDCs who are not ready, the OEB is already on side in recognizing the need for a contingency 	plan - it will likely be very simple: the IMO  would send a bill to the LDC each month and the LDC would bill customers at some fixed rate, with a deferral 	account). The key  issue will be how many LDCs (in terms of numbers and size)  are not ready and what is the minimum number of LDCs that 		the OEB/gov't is looking for to be ready. This is an issue we will have to talk to the MEST about as well as the OEB	, since ultimately the 			decision of whether enough LDCs are ready will be a political one.																													These are the OEB/retail focussed things we are doing.  On the  larger political front, I have several  ideas about some things  I would like to do that I can discuss with you and Paul.

With that said however, we are in the hands of the IMO and the OEB. I'm comfortable that we can continue to influence the IMO to produce a favorable announcement but I dont know what we can do to ensure that the OEB says its ready. Any suggestions, comments?

Dave, Here is my response to the concerns raised in your e-mail below
regarding exports from Ontario to the connected US markets:
 
                         a) Remember that the rules and policies under
development at the IMO will ensure that load in Ontario will not be cut in
order to support export transactions (in other words, Ontario, like most US
systems, has adopted a ""native load"" preference).
 
                              b) Remember also that the Ontario market
clearing price will be set by the offers and bids within Ontario.
Scheduled external demand will move us up the bid stack but cannot, for
instance, set the Ontario price by offering  lets say  $1,000 MWh. The
price paid by all internal and external  load (leaving aside the issue of
congestion) will    be set by the marginal bid in Ontario.
 
                                                                  c)
Remember also that the scope for  economic export transactions will be
limited by the impact of the export and wheeling tariff  ($1 MWh),
liability for uplift (estimated at approximately  $4  MWh), and the IMO
administration fee (estimated at $1MWh),  plus any wheeling/admin charges
applied by the connected markets.
 
                                                                  d)
Perhaps most importantly, remember that congestion costs will be charged in
respect of export transactions from the Ontario zone (assume low cost) to
an external intertie zone (assume high cost). A buyer from the Ontario spot
market in the external intertie zone will pay the aggregate of the Ontario
market clearing price plus the applicable congestion costs. Those
congestion costs are calculated as the difference between the Ontario price
(low cost) and the price in the external zone (high cost).  Two
features/implications of this regime are worth noting. First, the liability
to pay congestion costs will by itself reduce the scope for export
transactions of the scope and level you fear. (Though one can buy
transmission rights - TRs - which will provide a complete hedge against
congestion costs.)  Second, the congestion costs collected under this
regime will, after funding the hedge held by the holders of TRs, be applied
to reduce the revenue requirement of the transmission owners.  (In other
words, the surplus flows back to reduce the transmission rates that Ontario
consumers would otherwise pay).
 
                                                                  Hope this
helps you and your colleagues on the PACE.  Happy to answer any other
questions that you may have.

Aleck:  Thanks for getting back to me so quickly.  One point that I forgot
to mention was the impact of external demand.
 
At the same time that Ontario generators would be trying to sell into
higher priced US markets, marketers serving US customers would be trying to
buy lower cost power in Ontario to ship south.  As you pointed out, both
groups would need to take into account the costs of wheeling and exporting
the power.  However, if the price differential between the Ontario and US
markets was sufficient to offset these costs, electricity would flow to the
US until the price differential for delivered power was eliminated.  If
demand exceeded supply in the US market by an amount equal to or larger
than the US intertie capacity, and Ontario was the lowest-cost supply
alternative, the total demand for Ontario power (from native and foreign
sources) could exceed Ontario supply under extreme weather (as shown in the
table below).  Under these conditions, the price in Ontario would be bid up
by the US market imbalance.  Alberta would have had a similar problem with
its BC intertie, if it hadn't decoupled its market pricing so that the
market clearing price for Albertans is set only by local demand.
 
A second and perhaps more critical issue, is the technical capability of
the Ontario market.  Despite the rosy reports from the IMO, some market
participants have experienced IMO failures during testing and most MEUs
have indicated that they cannot be ready for a November opening.  Many
people feel that the risk of system failure must be eliminated or reduced
to a manageable insignificant level, before the market can be opened.
 
I would appreciate any additional thoughts you care to share on these
points.
 
Thanks,
 
Dave

David, here are some observations in response to your questions: a) You are
correct that we would expect Ontario-based generators to pursue economic
export opportunities in the connected US markets but we stress that the
economics of such exports will be affected not only by the comparative
generation costs, but also the cost of Hydro One's export and wheeling
tariff, the IMO uplift and related charges charged to all load (including
exports), transmission costs in the connected market, and any congestion
costs arising in the event that the intertie between Ontario and the
connected market is congested.  Everything else being equal, this means
that on average, power will trade within Ontario at a discount to prices in
the U S connected markets. b) With respect to volatility, it has to be
conceded that electricity is the most volatile of commodities. Having said
that, the period of most serious volatility is the summer months. Moreover,
we think it can be fairly said that volatility and price swings are
moderating in the Eastern Interconnect largely as a consequence of the
decrease in fuel costs (i.e. natural gas prices)  and extensive new
generation build - PIRA estimates that in Summer 2001 the year to year
increase in  available generation resources in the Eastern Interconnect is
about 30,000MW. This all adds up to increased price stability.   Again, my
colleague, Garrett Tripp, and I would be ready to meet with your group at
any time to go over these questions and our analysis in more detail.  Give
me a call if you would like to meet to discuss these points.   416 865

Thanks for the report.  It helped to validate the PACE conclusion that
there is sufficient supply to open the market without precipitating another
California.
 
The report mentions that imports would not set the MCP in Ontario and that
energy savings would be possible even if peak market demand was met by
imports, while in another section it concludes that Ontario could rely on
higher-priced imports to meet demand.   The first two points seem to
contradict the results from the IMO test runs, which indicate that the US
markets will set the clearing price in Ontario 90 percent of the time,
putting upward pressure on electricity prices in our market.  If prices are
higher in the adjacent markets, Ontario generators can be expected to
export power to the more lucrative markets rather than bidding into the
Ontario market, resulting in higher prices for Ontario since prices are
determined on the margin.  Price volatility and extreme price swings were
also identified as concerns by MEUs.
 
Were any of these concerns addressed in your presentation and are there any
comments you can share?"

		 Subject: Today's Meeting



Aleck,

First, thanks for spending time with us this morning.  I think it was a very
worthwhile meeting.

In your thinking about a scheme to satisfy Harris government political
concerns, please consider that the Premier said on May 1 that he is
insisting that before deregulation four conditions will have to be met over
the next 12 months. These are: a guarantee that consumers will be spared
from sharp rate hikes; a reliable supply of power; adequate environmental
safeguards; and continued support for alternative power sources.

I think we need, therefore, to consider how to freeing up the wholesale
market would not cross these four conditions.  For example, deregulating the
wholesale market would not appear to have any negative impact on
environmental safeguards or continued support for alternative power sources.
It may be that such a deregulation would have a positive impact (I noted in
today's WSJ that ENRON and 4 other companies are calling for CO2 caps).  How
could deregulating the wholesale market ""guarantee the consumers will be
spared from sharp rate hikes"" and ""provide a reliable supply of power""?

I think that any plan for reducing market risk that ENRON could suggest (as
you mentioned, Ontario could contract for future deliveries at a set price)
would seem to meet that requirement.  What needs to be clear is the
mechanism whereby this would be done.

If an alternative plan is then contrasted with the consequences of ENRON
pulling out of the Ontario market and the reciprocity repercussions for OPG
in NY, perhaps the Harris government would have the political cover as well
as the incentive to qualify its May 1 statement to include a November 2001
opening for the wholesale market.

best, Mitch"
,08/07/2001,,rob.milnthorp@enron.com,richard.shapiro@enron.com,,Ontario Market Opening,"Rick, as you are likely aware, Ontario market opening has once again been pushed back with March 2002 likely the earliest possible start. From a strategic standpoint, you will recall that we decided to align our interests with the outcome of the OEB/IMO readiness report due out in September. Our regulatory position was that it was highly likely that the outcome of this report would be positive and by supporting this initiative it would push the government to immediately open the market (likely November 2001). In the interim however, the OEB has unilaterally deferred market opening to 2002 with the deferral of stage 2 of the self-certification process from August to December. 

In my mind, we actually gave credence to the OEB and to some extent gave them the mandate to defer market opening. Lets discuss when you have a moment.

Regards
Rob"
,08/08/2001,,aleck.dadson@enron.com,richard.shapiro@enron.com,,RE: Ontario Market Opening - CONFIDENTIAL,"Rick, here are my comments: 
There was never any alternative on the table but to align ourselves with the IMO/OEB Market Readiness Plan.  It was never going to be possible to open the market without sufficient technical readiness on the part of the central institutions in the market - the IMO and the distributors.  We could not reasonably expect the Government to open the market if the primary regulator - i.e. the OEB -  was saying that the distributors were not ready. Anyone who thinks otherwise is dreaming.
We were instrumental in getting the OEB to adopt the  ""aggressive"" timetable that they did.  The distributors see us as being the main party pushing for tighter timelines etc. (And don't like us for it). There was little we could do (subject to what I  say several bullets below) to effect readiness other than pushing for the OEB to enforce timelines. 
Contrary to what Rob says, at no time was it our position that it was highly likely that the OEB report would be positive. See the bottom of the first page of our briefing note for Lavorato and Lay (attached) where we express uncertainty regarding distributor readiness.  Certainly our public position on readiness was upbeat - precisely so we could press our other positions re pricing, Pickering, etc. 	Those arguments would have been irrelevant if there was no prospect of sufficient technical readiness.
Our whole objective since April has been to keep November 2001 alive as prospect - so long as there was sufficient technical readiness (a factor over which we had little control).  
Just so you know,several months ago,  I raised the possibility of pushing for a split wholesale/retail opening and was told not to do so - because of the adverse commercial implications re the British Energy contract renegotiation. .  In any event, I think sticking with a single market opening is the correct approach - because it puts the stronger institution - the IMO - in the position of having a strong interest in pushing/pulling the weaker one - the OEB - along. 
Just so you know, several months ago, I raised the possibility of Enron Canada investing more resources in developing or securing from otherssuppliers  CIS systems etc. that could be made available to the distributors to get them ready.  This was dismissed. 
My expectation for several weeks (prior to the OEB report) was that the report would involve some delay (length uncertain) in retail market readiness.  Paul and others were advised.  
My understanding is that the IMO and IMO Board of Directors were informed of the OEB report the day or two before it was issued.  Milnthorp made it clear to me that he was afraid of telling Lavorato and left it to me to do so (via the material for Harris). I our conversation, Milly blamed the Chair of the IMO Board for caving in.  He never expressed the views set forth in his memo to you. 
Also, it is worth noting that the OEB report took the government - both the Ministry and the Premier's Office - by complete surprise.
Having said all this, I have to say that Paul has been fully supportive and nothing herein should be read as a criticism of him."

Garrett Tripp and I spoke yesterday to Chris Cincar, an economist who works for Judy.  We reviewed the rationale for the proposal with Chris and made the following points: a) we see no supply adequacy problem even in the event Pickering A is delayed; b) the purpose of the proposal is to offer an insurance policy so that the gov't can firm up a market opening date of March 1 without any concern about Pickering; c) the prices in any transaction completed pursuant to the proposal or something similar would not set the pool prices in Ontario;and  d) we emphasized that this was power for delivery during onpeak hours only.

Optican (Political and Economic Affairs Consul ), Patrick Santillo (Trade 
Consul) and Peter Dykeman (Trade 
Specialist).                                     They expressed the view 
that, from their perspective, there was a very real risk that  restructuring 
in Ontario will not proceed quickly  because of the political complications 
coming out of California.  However, the Consulate has  also made a decision 
to do what it  can to protect US commercial interests here -  the two 
interests they identified were those of Enron and 
Sithe.                                 They were  eager to explore  whether 
there was an interim step or half way measure that would protect our 
interests while allowing the government to play out the political agenda of 
proceeding (and being seen to proceed) cautiously. I suggested that the only 
such measure would be a scenario under which the IMO administered spot  
market (including the market for wholesale industrials)  opened this November 
and the retail market followed in the  Spring. There are arguments in favour 
of this approach : greater confidence in IMO system readiness compared to the 
distributor EBT/CIS systems; greater commitment of the IMO to market opening; 
likely support from OPG  to this since it could secure access to NY and 
proceed with FERC marketer authorization application;  it would enhance OPG's 
announced divestiture program re 4000 MW;  and consumers/distributors could 
be protected through a smoothed price plus a deferral account mechanism 
pending full retail access.                                              I 
explained OPG's position in NY where OPG had obtained a waiver of the NYISO 
tariff's ""reciprocity"" provisions on the basis of Dave Goulding's assurances 
in February 2001 that the market would open this year.  They understood and 
agreed that it was easier and preferable for  the Consulate to raise with the 
gov't the real potential that OPG's access may be lost unless the wholesale 
market opens this year.                                 I have committed to 
outlining a plan that focusses on wholesale market opening this Fall and 
providing it to them next week.  The model will obviously have to be 
consistent with the ""four guiding principles"" enunciated by the Premier and 
Minister of Energy:  ""protecting consumers and offering choice"", creating a 
strong business climate with a reliable supply of electricity"", ""protecting 
the environment"", and ""encouraging new ways of doing business and supporting 
the search for alternative sources of

Attached is my strategy plan for Ontario over the next four months.  I have discussed it with Paul DeVries and Rob Milnthorp and they are supportive.  

My market opening strategy dovetails with my thoughts on staffing in Toronto which are that we need immediate short term full time support for the next few for Enron Direct from either a contract employee/consultant/lawyer knowledgeable on Ontario retail and gas issues.  This person would be supported by me, Fino Tiberi, and Vinio Floris and may be offered a permanent position based on their performance during the contract period.  The project would be to do the assembly of pertinent rules, legislation, tariffs, etc that govern the retail gas and power markets in Ontario (same project Fino and Dave Vetsch are doing in Alberta).

On wholesale and market opening issues I intend to wait on replacing Aleck and instead rely solely on the market opening strategy (which includes my personal involvement) to cover off our advocacy requirements in Ontario over the next four months.  Coverage of more technical issues (eg those dealt with by the IMO Techical Panel) will be covered by me and Garrett Tripp (the trader in the Toronto Office who apparently has time given he is waiting for market opening).  I don't expect the technical work in requirements in Ontario will be extensive.  

Before the end of February, I will have a much better sense of the prospect for market opening and will then resume the search for a permanent Government Affairs staff member to assume Aleck's former responsibilities.  

Obviously nothing in this is written in stone, so I wanted to discuss with you guys preferrably today so or Monday morning.  I can be reached on my cell phone today at (403) 818-6797 (except between 12:00 and 4:00 your time when I am on a plane back to Calgary)

Ontario Treads Cautiously Along Its Toilsome Path Toward Deregulation



By Will McNamara
Director, Electric Industry Analysis






[News item from Reuters] Ontario, Canada's plan to open its electricity market to competition could happen earlier than the May 2002 target date, but the earlier timing is contingent upon the completion of a key report, a spokesperson for the province's energy minister said earlier this week. ""It's opening. We're just waiting to set a date and full steam ahead,"" said Christine Smith, a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Energy, Science and Technology. Ontario's government will make the decision regarding the start date for competition once the readiness report, which documents the preparedness of all the agencies involved in the privatization process, is completed and reviewed by both Energy Minister Jim Wilson and Premier Mike Harris. 

Analysis: The fact that the start of electric competition in Ontario, Canada's most populous province, may actually be on the near horizon is a major development, considering that deregulation in the region has been in the works-and has encountered several delays-since 1998. Shaken by the fiasco of direct access in California, along with the sudden price spikes that occurred in Alberta (Canada's only fully opened market), officials in Ontario have been rather reticent to proceed with dismantling the monopoly system in this region. However, it now appears that Ontario is finally moving forward with its deregulation plan, despite concerns from some of the major players in Canada that officials in the region have orchestrated what may become another troubled experiment in electric deregulation. 

Before discussing the current deregulation plans in Ontario, it is necessary to establish some key points about Canada as a whole, the province of Ontario in particular and trends within the energy market of the Great White North. From a national perspective, electric deregulation in Canada is occurring on a province-by-province basis (much like the United States is deregulating its market on a state-by-state basis). At this point, only Alberta has deregulated its electric market, which occurred in January 2001. Beyond Ontario, none of the other Canadian provinces (British Columbia, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, Quebec, Saskatchewan, or Yukon) have taken any definitive steps toward deregulating their electric markets and instead are approaching deregulation from a ""wait-and-see"" perspective. Part of this reticence toward deregulation among other Canadian provinces besides Alberta and Ontario relates to the generally low energy prices across Canada and the fact that the regions within the nation are vast and rather isolated from each other (thus making the issue of transmission interconnection a challenge). Ontario is an exception to this general rule, as the province has experienced relatively high prices and is interconnected with other provinces and the United States. 

As noted, Ontario is the most populous Canadian province, the home to 11 million people with an average power usage of 155 terrawatt hours a year, and representing a $10-billion electric market. The three main utilities in Ontario are Ontario Power Generation, the former Crown-owned utility that was formed by the replacement of Ontario Hydro Services Company with separate commercial companies in April 1999 and currently controls a total generating capacity of approximately 25,800 MW; Ottawa Hydro, which is owned by the city of Ottawa; and Toronto Hydro, which was created as a result of the convergence between six utility companies serving Toronto. Toronto Hydro consists of a transmission and distribution unit and an energy services company, but owns no generation of its own. Of the three, Ontario Power Generation has the market share in the province, reportedly serving about 85 percent of Ontario's power market. 

Deregulation of Ontario's natural-gas market took place in the late 1980s. Following plans that had been in the works since at least 1998, electric deregulation in Ontario was originally scheduled to begin in November 2000, although it was postponed another 18 months due to concerns from officials after witnessing the well-documented problems in California. Energy Minister Jim Wilson reportedly was also concerned about Alberta's experience with electric deregulation. Competition in Alberta's wholesale and retail power market began on Jan. 1, 2001, a time at which wholesale prices for natural gas were staggeringly high. High demand and short supply in Alberta caused rates in the province to immediately double upon the onset of deregulation, a development that has naturally given great pause to other Canadian governments. Natural-gas and electricity prices in Alberta have since fallen dramatically, as elsewhere in North America, but not before the Alberta government was forced to give hefty rebates to customers to compensate for the sharp increases. 

Under Ontario's evolving deregulation plan, retail markets will remain under the oversight of the Ontario Energy Board, the provincial power regulator, and are scheduled to open at the same time as wholesale markets. Under the retail system, customers will have the option of arranging their electricity purchases directly from suppliers at fixed-price contracts, or having energy purchased for them by distribution companies, agents, brokers, or marketers at fluctuating prices. Most reports indicate that Ontario is well positioned to open its market to competition, at least from a supply perspective; in fact, Ontario government officials have claimed that the province has adequate power supply, fueled mostly by hydro and nuclear energy, along with planned investments in new generation. However, other observers have claimed that the delay in the start date for competition in Ontario is serving as a deterrent for new generation investments in the region. Reports from earlier in 2001 indicated that Ontario will need an additional 1,000 MW of generation in addition to its existing capacity of 26,000 MW to meet demand, and only one 450-MW plant had been officially announced. 

In addition, despite the assurances from the government, some companies have claimed that the deregulation policy outlined by the Ontario Energy Board is fundamentally uncompetitive. For instance, one company that appears to have very little interest in the new opportunities in Ontario is Calgary-based TransCanada Pipelines Ltd., Canada's largest natural-gas pipeline company and a huge player in the country's regulated marketplace. One of the key criticisms that TransCanada officials have raised is that the Ontario government is implementing a policy in which the bulk of Ontario's high-quality generating assets will remain controlled by Ontario Power Generation, leaving only undesirable plants on the auction block. In other words, even in a deregulated market, Ontario Power Generation may continue to hold the market share of generation in Ontario. TransCanada claims that this approach will diminish investment interest in Ontario and do little to entice new generating companies from entering the province. TransCanada, which has previously made acquisitions of natural-gas fired plants in Alberta and the northeastern United States, does not think that the province will offer a very competitive market and appears to have little interest in moving into the Ontario electric market. Note that in mid-October, Mirant Corp. (NYSE: MIR) announced that it had entered into an agreement to purchase the majority of the gas marketing business of TransCanada, making it the largest natural-gas marketer in Canada and the largest natural-gas exporter to the United States. 

Under the Ontario Energy Board's deregulation plan, Ontario Power Generation must sell or lease 4,000 MW of its non-nuclear power within 42 months of the opening of the Ontario market. Currently, Ontario Power Generation owns 9,700 MW of fossil-fuel capacity; 8,728 MW of nuclear power; and 7,309 MW of hydroelectric power. Obviously, the governmental mandate regarding the divestiture leaves the bulk of the province's generating capacity under the control of Ontario Power Generation, which is a major point of contention for potential competitors. 

It is important to note that the office of Ontario Energy Minister Jim Wilson does not share TransCanada's perspective. In fact, a spokesperson for the office said generation assets such as the Mississagi hydroelectric system and the gas-fired Lennox plant in southwestern Ontario, both of which Ontario Power Generation will be divesting, represent very valuable assets that should be a desirable way for companies such as TransCanada to enter the deregulated market. Also note that TransCanada has expressed concerns only about opportunities in Ontario's electric market, and the company already has rather extensive gas-pipeline investments in the province. Nevertheless, enabling the opportunity for new companies to gain generating assets currently owned by Ontario Power Generation is a key factor to the success of Ontario's deregulated market. 

Moreover, Ontario inches ever closer to a competitive electric market, but a good number of concerns about the province's plan for deregulation remain unresolved. There is great anticipation for the report that is expected shortly from the Ontario Energy Board, which may specifically address the divestiture policy for Ontario Power Generation that has troubled companies such as TransCanada. Certainly, there is great hope that no further delays of the deregulation start date in Ontario, and that province officials either maintain or accelerate the May 2002 start. Just as Canadian officials have closely watched the move toward deregulation in the United States, U.S. companies continue to monitor Canada's slow, province-by-province progression toward competition. As noted, Mirant Corp. already has gained a market edge in the natural-gas sector of Canada by acquiring the assets of TransCanada. Duke Energy, Calpine Corp. and Devon Energy have also penetrated the Canadian natural-gas market with pending acquisitions of Westcoast Energy, Encal Energy and Anderson Exploration, respectively. The next horizon for the Canadian energy market is electric deregulation, and industry eyes remain on Ontario as the only Canadian province that is following Alberta into electric competition.

Has my Spec Markets professor been in touch with you yet?  I gave him your
card last week and he said he would contact you.  In case you want to

On another note, all of campus was delighted that Billybob's reopened
today.  It is now run by his widow, since Billybob himself was shot last
Summer (as you remember, they found him in the walk-in freezer).  The
decor is back to the traditional ""ghetto style,"" which means no more pink
walls or bad chinese food.  Forties of malt liquor will return in two
weeks once the liquor license is approved.

Looking forward to seeing you later in the semester...

Below is the link you require for the full trading game which we originally developed to enhance our A&A recruitment, there is also an Origination / Modelling exercise.

http://enrontradinggame.corp.enron.com/

The demo lasts for 4 minutes, the full exercise lasts 24 minutes.

We will in the next Quarter role out Trading Game 2 a totally interactive exchage for up to 10 people.  Whilst the first one was used as a recruitment tool, this one we anticipate using for training purposes too.  Here is a test site for it.  To make it fun you really need 4/5 people to play, it takes about 10-15 minutes.  It has the capability that we could, with further development, load scenario players - Bullish / bearish, different trading strategies etc.  

 
http://207.21.194.106/enron2 


I was hoping to launch it with a bit of a splash by sending out a note on Global Flash inviting people to log on at a certain time and having heavy weight traders to play with people like yourself, John, Greg, Joe, - with a prize for the best score, you never know what talents we could uncover! Maybe if you like it, you would volunteer your services?

Let me know what you think.

It may work better if you insert your slides into this template.

We are suggesting that for comparison purposes for financial data we only show 2001 Third CE and 2002 Plan.  If that does not tell the story you are trying to present, then do what you need to and we can discuss with Stan on Nov. 1.

I will not need anything in advance of the Nov. 1 meeting with Stan.  However, I will need all presentations for the Lay Reviews at

Good that you put some analysis with the price changes.  I'd be a bit careful about declaring that prices are expected to continue increasing through November --- many market observers (particularly Mr. Ross Hay-Roe) believe there's a good chance that the US$15/metric ton increase the producers already received will begin to erode in the next few weeks.  I think it's important that we give air time to all the possibilities, especially in light of the high degree of uncertainty surrounding the market.  Thanks.

Subsequent to my last e-mail I discovered an additional detail which may possibly clarify why ENCE prefers to purchase the Chilean E. globulus species to the Brazilian species for pulp production.  It would appear that the E. globulus species holds up better than the various Brazilian species during the refining process.  While most papermakers generally don't refine hardwoods and softwoods with the same equipment, many smaller European mills are unable to afford the capital investment of a second refiner and accordingly do use a single refiner for all grades.  This is particularly true of the Italian mills.  Since hardwoods cannot withstand the rigorous refining required for softwoods without losing their papermaking characteristics (opacity, etc.), these papermakers need to utilize the hardwood species best suited for this type of processing.  Accordingly, the globulus species (which is also the predominant species in the Iberian peninsula) holds up much better under this type of heavy refining than any other species of eucalyptus.

In any case, I hope this helps shed additional light on this issue, and, as always, please feel free to revert with any questions you might have.  Thanks.

In Enron in Possible Step Toward Merger
By ROBIN SIDEL 
Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL

Dynegy Inc. is in advanced discussions to infuse about $2 billion into Enron Corp. in a transaction that may lead to a full-blown merger between the two companies, people familiar with the matter said.
A formal transaction could be unveiled as early as Thursday, these people said. The situation is very fluid and is subject to change, these people noted.
Enron has been rocked by last month's disclosure of a $1.2 billion reduction in its equity base partly tied to financial dealings with company partnerships headed by Enron's former chief financial officer. Last month, it reported a third-quarter loss of $618 million. The Securities and Exchange Commission has launched a formal investigation into the matter. Last week, Enron secured $1 billion in new credit lines, using gas-pipeline assets as collateral.
Enron needs the infusion in part because its previously announced plans to raise cash through the sale of power assets is going more slowly than expected. Mostly, though, it needs to restore its credibility with Wall Street at a time when its access to the financing markets is drying up."

,11/12/2001,,billy.lemmons@enron.com,,,Associate / Analyst Program,"After several very difficult weeks, Enron announced on Friday that the company has reached an agreement to merge with Dynegy.  

I know that everyone has many questions right now regarding the future of the Associate / Analyst Program.  We are working as quickly as possible with the business units and executive management to determine the future course of the Program.  As the merger points on the Enron homepage indicate (), Dynegy has a similar program called ""PACE"", and the two companies will consider a combination of the two programs.  

Today, all of the business units within Enron will be holding floor meetings to discuss the pending merger and it's implications for Enron.  I encourage each of you to participate in one of these meetings.  

The announcement of the deal with Dynegy marks a significant event in removing some of the uncertainties we've all dealt with over the past several weeks.  As decisions are made regarding the future of the company and specific business units, we will be able to determine and communicate the future of the Program.

New opportunities will be created from the changes that are occurring.  The very best talent from both organizations will rise to the top, and our Associates and Analysts will be a key part of our future success.

I appreciate your continued efforts and patience during this difficult time.

November 14, 2001 

  

	
	Retail Review:  October Retail Sales Up 7.1% To A New 8 -Year Low

The strength of retail sales impacts advertising expenditures and thus paper consumption. This supplemental report will review several items related to retail sales and advertising spending so the title is only partially descriptive - but I couldn't pass up the opportunity

The title story first. The October increase in national retail sales of 7.1% over September should be accompanied by a chorus of ""Happy Days are Here Again"" - but let's take a closer look. Auto sales were up 26.4% in October due to a 0% interest promotional program, which was obviously a great success, but is unrepeatable. Excluding auto sales, national retail sales were up only 1% over depressed September sales.

When comparing October of 2001 to October of 2000, retail sales, excluding autos, were up only 1.6%, which according to The Dismal Scientist, is the slowest year-over-year growth in at least 8 years. Furniture, home furnishings, and electronic retailers all had lower sales than in October 2000, while apparel sales were flat. Early anecdotal reports in November seem to point to modest improvement over October. There will be a Christmas season but it won't be robust and it's too early to break out into song.

Ad Pages and Survivorship Bias

The Magazine Publishers Association reported that year-to-date ad pages through August were down 11.2%. However, September ad pages were down 9.9% and that brought the year-to-date decline to 9.2%! How can ad pages be reduced from a negative 11.2% year-to-date to a negative 9.2% year-to-date by the inclusion of a one-month decline of 9.9%? It's not easy.

""Survivorship Bias"" can be the manipulation of a reality TV show or, in this case, provide the answer to our ad page dilemma. MPA ad pages are calculated each month by comparing the year-over-year change of a specific list of magazines. New magazines are only added at the beginning of each year. However, when magazines cease publication during the year, both last year's ad pages and this year's ad pages are eliminated. Since magazines which cease publication during the year will almost always have ad page declines greater than average before closure (and a 100% decline after closure), the elimination of these magazines from the survey creates a positive bias - a survivorship bias. Only surviving magazines are considered.

It was the closure of The Industry Standard in August that was largely responsible for the ad page anomaly between the August and September year-to-date data. Ad pages in The Industry Standard were down 76% through August, but since there was no September publication, this magazine was no longer included in the survey and this huge drop in ad pages was no longer represented in the data.

This year has been an especially difficult year for magazine publishers. Through August, more than 60 titles were eliminated, and many were not new publications. Nineteen had been in business prior to 1990 and five had start-ups between 1928 and 1959. Mademoiselle ends a 66-year run in November.

Since all these closures will be purged from ad page data, the real ad page decline is significantly greater than that being reported.

October Ad Pages

Monthly reports of year-over-year ad page declines had bottomed in May and, while still negative, had improved for three consecutive months. Absent the events of September 11, October ad pages would have likely declined between 4 and 8%. October was, however, the first month of ad pages to be impacted by September 11 and was down 16.8% from October 2000.

Catalog Sales

Catalog Age tracks 17 publicly traded consumer catalogers and indicated that 8 out of 17 of these companies had reported a net loss in the second quarter.

September 11 events, the anthrax situation, and another postage increase sometime in the next 9 months are exacerbating what was already a very difficult economic environment for catalogs.

When Will The Economy Bottom?

Most economists are expecting a short, mild recession, which will bottom in Q1/02. We won't argue the point very hard but still expect the bottom a little later, hopefully by Q2/02. Since retail is about 2/3's of our economy, any turnaround will have to be accompanied by an improvement in retail sales. Until this turnaround takes place, print advertising and print consumption will remain under pressure.

I would contact the other finance guys here. Who knows, they may have
some great leads. As far as the letter is concerned, I would be happy to
do it. Generally, however, each grad school has a specific
recommendation form that they want references to fill out. So let me
know after you get the required info from the schools. Typically,
students just send it to me as I will probably have to submit it
directly to the grad school people as they generally want confidential
letters.

I am interested for the master's degree at Bocconi and I have a few questions regarding the application below:
1) Can I pay the application fee in US dollars? I don't know if I can write a check in Euros. If yes, how much would it cost in US dollars?
2) I downloaded the application packet from the internet but I can't find the CHECK CARD that is required for the application. Where can I find it?
3) It says in the instructions that the envelopes provided should be used for the letters of recommendations and transcrips. But since I downloaded the application I don't have the provided e chosen just the MBA?
5) Can I do all application process online including recommendations, transcrips?
6) One of the questions in the application asks for the graduate degree, does this mean undergraduate degree? The reason I ask is that I haven't seen any question asking for undergraduate, only fo dollars instead?

,10/25/2001,,no.address@enron.com,,,Jeff McMahon Named CFO,"Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work."

Hollinger Canadian Newspapers 3Q net income more than doubles y.o.y.
11/27/2001 05:42:58, BW




TORONTO, Nov. 26, 2001(Business Wire/press release) -- Hollinger Canadian
Newspapers, L.P. (TSE:HCN.UN.) announces net income including special
items for the quarter ending September 30, 2001 of $51,415,000 or
$0.28 per unit compared to $22,567,000 or $0.14 per unit for the
quarter ended September 30, 2000. 
    For the nine months ended September 30, 2001 the net income was
$167,603,000 or $0.92 per unit compared to $75,550,000 or $0.47 per
unit for the nine months ended September 30, 2000.
    Income before special items and income taxes in both the third
quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2001 was significantly
lower than in 2000, primarily as a result of the disposition of
properties to CanWest Global Communications Corp. (""CanWest"") in
November 2000, the sale of UniMedia Company in January 2001, the sale
of the majority of the Ontario properties in July 2001 as well as
lower operating results at the Partnership's remaining operations,
offset in part, by lower interest expense as a result of the
conversion of the acquisition notes to units in November of 2000 and
interest income primarily related to the CanWest debentures received
in November of 2000.
    In the first nine months of 2001 special items totalled
$117,777,000 and included gains arising mainly from the sale of
UniMedia Company in January 2001 and the sale of the majority of the
remaining Ontario community newspapers in July 2001. In the first nine
months of 2000, special items totalled a loss of $1,672,000 and
principally represented severance charges. 

    Same Store Analysis

    On a same store basis, including only those newspapers which were
owned for the nine-month period in each year, total revenue was
$77,421,000 in 2001 compared to $81,982,000 in 2000, a decrease of
$4,561,000 or 5.6%. EBITDA for 2001 was $8,581,000 compared to
$10,756,000 for 2000, a decrease of $2,175,000 or 20.2%.

    Investment and Other Income

    For the nine months ending September 30, 2001, investment and
other income includes a cash dividend of $1,225,000 on 8,164,000
CanWest non-voting shares, interest on cash balances of approximately
$3,300,000, interest income of $23,958,000 accrued on the subordinated
debentures the Partnership received as partial consideration from the
sale of newspapers to CanWest in November 2000 and other interest
income of $2,272,000. This debenture interest is payable at the option
of CanWest either in cash, by the issue of additional debentures or by
the issue of CanWest shares. The total principal amount of debentures
(as adjusted, if required) is due on November 15, 2010. The principal
amount of these debentures was $239,861,000 as at December 31, 2000.
On February 28, 2001 and July 31, 2001, a CanWest subsidiary issued
additional debentures with a total principal amount of $20,983,000 to
the Partnership. These debentures represent the arrears interest owing
from November 16, 2000 to July 31, 2001 calculated at 12.125% per
annum, of which $17,473,000 relates to the current year. As a result,
the principal amount of all CanWest debentures held at September 30,
2001 is $260,844,000.

    Financial Condition and Liquidity

    Working capital consists of current assets less current
liabilities. At September 30, 2001, working capital was $28,398,000
compared to $43,473,000 at December 31, 2000. The $15,075,000
reduction in working capital results from lower cash balances on hand
at September 30, 2001 primarily due to cash distributions in excess of
cash inflows during the period.
    Long-term debt, including the current portion was $100,000 at
September 30, 2001 compared with $1,237,000 at December 31, 2000.
    Cash flows provided by operating activities were $22,783,000 in
the nine months ended September 30, 2001 compared with cash flows
provided by operating activities of $98,981,000 in 2000. The reduction
in cash flows provided by operating activities compared to 2000
results primarily from the sales of the Unimedia and Ontario newspaper
properties and lower operating results at the Partnership's remaining
operations.
    Cash flows used in financing activities were $375,062,000 for the
nine months ended September 2001 as compared to $107,953,000 for 2000.
The cash flows used in financing activities included cash
distributions of $374,968,000 in 2001 as compared to $107,424,000 in
2000.
    Cash flows provided by investing activities were $340,143,000 for
the nine months ended September 30, 2001 as compared to cash flow used
in investing activities of $7,963,000 in 2000. The increase in cash
flows provided by investing activities results primarily from the
proceeds on sale of the Unimedia and Ontario papers in January and
July of 2001. 

    Distributions

    During the year, the Partnership has paid two special
distributions of $0.70 in March of 2001 and $1.18 in August of 2001
using the proceeds from the sale of properties during the year.

    General

    In September 2001, the Partnership, Hollinger International Inc.
and Hollinger Inc. announced that the Partnership had constituted a
committee of independent directors to explore with Hollinger the
possibility of an offer to purchase the units of the Partnership not
held by Hollinger, being approximately 24 million units. The structure
and terms of any such offer (including the form of consideration to be
offered) have not been proposed and there can be no assurance that any
offer will be made.

    Properties Owned

    Attached to this report is a list of the principal operating
divisions owned by the Partnership at the current time.

LOS ANGELES, Nov 27, 2001 - Forestweb Inc. will be providing  its 
pricing for market pulp, publication grade papers, stumpage, and logs 
to users of the Bloomberg Professional service.

The Los Angeles-based Forestweb has signed an agreement with 
Bloomberg that offers subscribers to the Bloomberg Professional 
service access to both Forestweb Exclusive content and the option to 
subscribe to benchmark pricing from PriceBeat. Forestweb Exclusive 
content includes Forestweb's staff written market reviews. PriceBeat 
is an online subscription-based price and information service.

Pulp prices include prices in the U.S. for northern bleached softwood 
kraft (NBSK), southern bleached softwood kraft (SBSK), northern 
bleached hardwood kraft (NBHK), southern bleached hardwood kraft 
(SBHK), and bleached eucalyptus kraft (BEK). The price in Europe for 
NBSK is also offered.

Forestweb's pulp prices are reported by Diane Keaton. Ms. Keaton has 
been covering market pulp for the past seven years and for the past 
22 months as an editor and reporter with Forestweb. Ms. Keaton has 
been described by a pulp executive as ""arguably the most 
knowledgeable market pulp authority in the public domain.""

Publication grade prices include newsprint, hi-brite, supercalendered 
(SC-A), 40-lb coated #5, and 60-lb coated #3. Uncoated free-sheet 
grades include 50-lb offset rolls and 20-lb cut size (copy paper).

Reel Time newsletter editors Verle Sutton and Ross Hay-Roe provide 
Forestweb the pricing for publication and communication papers. Reel 
Time is a monthly newsletter offering analysis and forecasts for 
printing paper markets.

Forest2Market provides Forestweb stumpage prices for pine pulpwood, 
pine chip-n-saw, pine sawtimber, hardwood pulpwood, and hardwood 
sawtimber for three southern regions - west south, mid-south, and 
east south. Stumpage refers to the price of timber before it has been 
harvested. Forest2Market is the leading provider of timber pricing 
information for the U.S. South.

Logs are a major export market to the Pacific Rim, with Japan being 
the largest importer of U.S. logs. Forestweb's log prices are 
available through Pacific Rim Wood Market Report, a Forestweb 
publication. It is the only comprehensive timber industry newsletter 
that covers U.S. domestic and export log markets, providing prices, 
trends, and analyses.

Norske is planning to shutdown 2 paper machines until market conditions improve. No. 3 paper machine at Port Alberni and No. 1 paper machine at Elk Falls are currently scheduled for shutdown in the 1Q02. A third paper machine, No. 1 at Crofton, is also planned for shutdown during the month of January.  This translates into about 34,000 MT for 1Q02 at Elk Falls (since Port Alberni produces mostly directory) and about 12,000 MT at the Crofton mill for January.  Given the uncertain economic climate, the company will review curtailment plans monthly so it can be quick to respond to any upturn in market conditions.

Advance Publications' The Star-Ledger of Newark, N.J., is struggling to find $10 million to slash from its budget because many of its key retail advertisers have filed for bankruptcy or cut their spending.  The Star-Ledger still promises to honor its famous handbook pledge not to lay off any of its nonunion employees due to a bad turn in the economy.  The Star-Ledger also canceled its Christmas party, has closed a small satellite office in Newark, is offering buyouts to selected employees, and will decrease the amounts of its annual raises and bonuses.  The Star-Ledger has a  410,547-weekday-circulation newspaper and about 132,449 MT in newsprint consumption.  The carnage continues as the loss of advertising dollars plagues newspapers.

We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing.

Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other.  In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed.  Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement.

In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron.  It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained.  To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals.

,10/29/2001,,euco.uutela@t-online.de,monika.causholli@enron.com,,RE: Tissue,"Dear Ms. Causholli,

TAD equals to through-air-drying, a process where hot air is blown in a drum 
through the paper web and drying it. It allows a higher bulk of tissue paper as 
the paper web is not pressed hard against iron as in the case of conventional 
drying. Higher bulk means softer paper and better absorbency properties, 
therefore it is prefeered by companies aiming at very high tissue quality. I am 
not a technical expert but machinery manufacturers, especially Metso Paper's 
Honeycomb division in the USA could explain TAD in more technical terms.

AfH stands for away-from-home, i.e. uses in offices, industry, hotels, 
restaurants, hospitals etc. outside households.

I have not yet updated all the 2000 numbers but will do it within the 
next couple of months. Some data is very difficult to obtain, and thus updating 
takes a lot of time.

They included a matrix on which they would display various fiber characteristics, which I'm attaching.  Cecil and I went over it and he suggested some changed, which are incorporated here. The only one he wants to add that isn't reflected here---but which we need to tell them---is that we want to know why each quality parameter (the column headings) is important to each major end-use (paper grade) application.

Let's go over this Monday morning.

As always, we advise you to review your overall investment strategy and carefully weigh the potential earnings of each investment choice against its risk before making investment decisions that are aligned with your long-term financial plans and your risk tolerance. 

For that reason, it is critical that ALL trades among your investment funds be completed by 3:00 PM CST Friday, October 26 before the transition period begins."

The Fundamental Analysis Team is developing a presentation database that will:

Creating a centralized repository of presentations that are current for each commodity group
Better document management - multiple users can simultaneously view and select various slides.  This will increase speed of presentation development since users can email their 
        selected information to the development team.
Add to Cart feature - allow employees to select the slides they need from various presentations and email it to their inboxes. 
Provide standardized formats and up-to-date information

We are in the process of developing a program that will encompass the benefits above.  In the meantime, a temporary database has been created in the 
o:/Industrial Markets/Fundamentals/Presentation Database.  The database is divided in to commodity groups and specific topics.

Please forward me any presentations that you are currently using and I will add them to this database.  If you have any questions, please call me.

While I feel reasonably comfortable with the numbers and the timing of projects coming online, some additional work will be required to gain 100% confidence in this information.  This should be completed within the next two weeks.  

In addition, as the trend of replacing mixed tropical hardwood with higher quality plantation acacia is already underway, I will make an attempt to identify the timber resources of the largest market pulp producers and when they anticipate initiating production of acacia pulp.  Given the scope of this project, it may require several weeks to complete.

Finally, I'm considering implementing a monitoring system similiar to the one already covering the Brazilian producers so we can accurately track activity by the Indonesian producers.  The information I've seen from PPPC, and particularly RISI, does not appear to be very accurate.  However, if anyone has an alternative source for shipments, production, inventory, etc. data, I'm open to suggestions.

In any case, I hope this assists in shedding some light on an otherwise difficult region, and, as always, I welcome your feedback.  Thanks.

about people...our people.  You are the driving force behind every success 
that our company has experienced, including our high-performing stock price, 
which surpassed the $50 mark only a few days ago. You made it happen!

To show our appreciation for your hard work and commitment to Enron,s 
continued success, eligible regular full-time and regular part-time employees 
who were on the payroll of a wholly-owned Enron company at Dec. 31, 1999 will 
receive 50 Enron stock options.  A special stock option award certificate and 
a copy of the stock plan will be sent to you in the next few weeks.

About the stock options grant:
? The grant was effective Jan. 18, 2000, therefore, the option grant price is 
$55.50.
? Options will have a seven-year term, which means you must exercise these 
options before seven years have passed.
? Options will vest 25 percent on Feb. 28, 2000 and 25 percent each 
subsequent January 18th thereafter until fully vested, as long as you are an 
employee of Enron.  This means you may exercise 25 percent of these options 
as early as Feb. 28.
? This grant is made in accordance with the terms and provisions of the Enron 
Corp. Stock Plans and the award documents, which you will receive in the 
coming weeks. 

Due to varying international restrictions and legalities, Enron employees in 
certain international locations will receive some other form of recognition.  
Your local management and human resources representative will communicate 
further details.

Visit home.enron.com for additional information.  There you can access a list 
of frequently asked questions regarding stock options.  And you can view a 
special message from Ken Lay.  To access the special message, you must have 
IP-TV and a sound card. If you are not able to view Ken,s message, a 
transcript is available.  If you encounter any technical difficulties, please 
contact your PC Help Desk.

Again, thank you for all you do to make Enron a successful global energy and 
broadband services company and a great place to work."

There was plenty of generation online for Sat. and Sun.  FE offered out 150 
mw's at $38 for a 16-hr. schedule for Monday.  No one had any interest at 
this price level.  There were no decent bids for saturday or sunday.   On 
saturday we moved  Ecar power down to Florida most of the day until TLR's 
were called.  On sunday during the evening peak Soco was on the bid($25), 
unfortunately TLR's prevented any energy from moving into Serc.  Most 
utilities will be sellers in the morning.

 TLR's were abundant over the weekend.  CE, Ameren and other Main members 
were not able to send power into Serc or Frcc.  No legitimate bids while 
sellers had plenty of power.  Ameren was an island due to TLR's.  CE will be 
selling hourly all day Monday.  CE quoted an offer of $36 for a 16-hr 
schedule, for he 7 they quoted $12, with no bids to move it to.   Ameren will 
also be selling hourly if TLR's do not kick in.  No one had any interest in 
picking up a preschedule.

Prices for the evening peak were offered out in the high teens to low 
twenties.  Bids were in the low teens.  TLR's were called thus preventing 
power from moving down to the south.  Off-peak prices were just as ugly with 
offers in the mid teens and no one showing a bid.  PJM called for min. gen. 
for a couple of hours.  After he 23 LGEE began sending 365 mw's to TVA.  This 
was the only movement of power in Ecar per Oasis.  For Tuesday everyone will 
have hourly power to sell.  FE will have 200-300 mw's to move each hour.  No 
one had much interest in picking up a pre-schedule for Tuesday. 



MAIN

Prices in Main were a little lower than in Ecar.  Bids for the evening peak 
were in the low teens and for off peak bids were in the single digit's.  CE, 
Ameren, IP and Wepco will have hourly power to sell.  ALT bought 150 mw's on 
a preschedule for Tuesday.  They bought this preschedule from their neighbors 
in the low 20's.  They will be looking to pick up another 50 mw's beginning 
he 9.  They will be looking to pay in the low 20's again.  This was the only

 For the evening peak prices remained strong.  TLR's prevented any movement 
of power into Florida during the evening peak.  TVA was the culprit in 
calling for TLR's.  TLR's were not called off until He  22.  For He 23 and He 
24 we sold 100mw's  to FPL at $41 and $36.  For HE 1 they bought directly 
from their neighbors at $18.  FPC, JEA and TECO were flat for these hours.  
For hours 2-6 FPL was a  $15 bid.  Due to limited hourly trans. available and 
the likelihood of TLR's a short schedule sale to Florida was not possible.    
 


SERC

TLR's were still in place for the evening peak thus limiting the import of 
power into SERC from the North.  The eveving peak saw all of SOCO interfaces 
showing -0-.  Starting HE 23  the EES side of SOCO opened up with 150 mw's.  
We were able to move Cajn power into Florida staring HE 23.  We offered SOCO 
$45 for this hour and they passed on it.  Off-peak offers were in the low 
20's.  SOCO was a $16 bid.  No one would show a decent  bid for a 16-hr 
preschedule.  The guys on shift would not show a bid or offer for a 16-hr 
preschedule.  They will wait until the afternoon to start buying.  Most of 
the night guys in SERC believe that TLR's will once again be called by TVA 
starting in the afternoon."

reasonable offer at $60.   TLR's prevented any new schedules from being 
started until he 23.    Off- peak bids were in the low to mid teen's.  SOCO 
was buying $15 from their neighbor's.  Vepco offered out $14.00 into TVA or 
into EES for off-peak.  This power ended up being sold to EES.  EES would not 
show us a bid for off-peak.   For Wednesday SOCO and SCEG will be buying 
hourly after the morning peak.  Duke and Vepco will be buying for economics.  
SOCO did not want to pre-schedule anything for Wednesday.

40's to mid 50's bids for the evening peak.  The only offer for the evening 
peak was a $100 offer from FPL.   For off-peak, bids were in the mid teens,

started with an AEP to SOCO sink.  TVA admitted this mistake to us.   OPC and 
SOCO were the strongest bid across the evening peak.  OPC was an $80 bid for

bid during the evenng peak and he was trying to buy under his gas units.  
VEPCO was a $50 offer, unfortunately, VEPCO was a bad source for SOCO and 
OPC.  For off-peak OPC was the strongest bid for he23 and 24.  We sold them

being cut.  We ended up buying from CSW(wtu-$48) thinking this was north 
enough.  The ISO killed the deal.  They told us that as of Friday WTU will

You know you are at a SERIOUS MEXICAN BIRTHDAY  PARTY IF:
?
1.??? Some of the guests didn't  bring a gift, but brought extra uninvited 
kids.
2.??? When the cake says ""Happy  Birthday Mijo"" instead of the child's real 
name.
3.??? The party is at Chuck E.  Cheese, but they brought their own food, 
cake, and a pinata.
4.??? It's a party, but there are  more grown-ups than children.
5.??? It's ""Mijo's"" 1st Birthday and  the party food is carne asada, arroz 
con frijoles puercos, y 10 cases of  beer.
6.??? For entertainment, instead of  playing pin the tail on the donkey, 
there is usually a televised baseball,  football game, or a live fight.
7.??? They don't sing Happy  Birthday, instead everyone is salsa dancing.
8.??? The party was over at 5:00,  it's 10:00 and the party is just starting.
9.??? You find out from Abuela that  Abuelo is taking viagra.
10.??? The host calls someone who's  on their way and tells them to stop and 
get some tortillas and ice.
11.??? The guests start arriving and  the hostess disappears to get ready.
12.??? You hear someone go up to the  birthday child and say ""Mira, tan cute!""
13.??? Someone else says? ""I'm  going to have to get you something next week 
when I get paid.
14.??? The party is Saturday, and  you get a call from the hostess Friday 
night saying, ""I'm giving Mijo a birthday  party tomorrow at 3:00.""
15.??? Some guests bring gifts that  are still in the store bag unwrapped.
16.??? There always seems to be more  family than friends at the party.
17.??? You have the party over at  your's brother's because he bought a new 
house and he has a pool.
18.??? The cake didn't come from the  store; it came from the mother of the 
comadre of your friend's sister who makes  really good cakes.
19.??? You are told you have to save  your plate and fork you ate your food 
with, so you can eat you  cake.
20.??? Someone calls and says they  can't make it, but asks that you save 
them some cake.
21.??? Guests are wrapping up cake  to take to Madre, Tio, Abuela, Chata y el 
Junior.
22.??? The party music is coming  from a small boom box.
23.??? The birthday child is dressed  from head to toe in Tommy.
24.??? The birthday baby's Daddy  comes to the party and brings the kid he 
had before and after the Birthday  Baby.
25.??? It's ""Mijo's"" party, but  since his cousin Madonna is there and her 
birthday is in a few days, it becomes  Mijo's and Madonna's party.
?
Power to la Raza

I thought this was?something to share with all  you REAL Mexicans and those 
who are still trying to get to know  us..........

for both LNG and Middle East.  Note that I have also listed separately some 
of the other important stuff that we are trying to get done this year.

With regard to LNG, when I look at  what we are trying to get done this year, 
it leads me to conclude that we still have not come to grips with what we 
need to do to really grow this business.  Therefore, I drafted another, more 
broad statement of what I believe we need to be doing to realize our LNG 
vision.  I believe that this is critical and that we have not yet confronted 
the reality as to what we need to be doing.  I am anxious to discuss this

I'm told that if you dial the wrong code you'll get a recording telling you which code to use.

It is also possible to call person-to-person by calling the local operator and asking for the INMARSAT operator.  You will need to give the INMARSAT operator the name of the ship, the guest's name and the closest land position.

Thanks for your note.  Glad to hear you and yours are well.  

We docked in Southampton on Monday morning so I was already in our London office on Tuesday and just back from lunch when the news started coming through.  I was traveling with a couple of friends from NYC (Amanda McGovern, Noble Black's UVA classmate, and Linda Hayman, her mom and a friend of mine from my Skadden days) so it was rather tense for a while as we tried to find their friends but everyone came through pretty well.  Our return had been scheduled for Wednesday of that week so of course we were stranded in London but made it back Sunday.  Not that we were having much fun, but there were worse places to be stranded.  I felt bad for the QE2 passengers on their way from Southampton to NYC.  They would have gotten the news on their first day at sea and had to spend what should have been a pleasant cruise thinking about events and worrying.

I've heard good things from both Anne and Brad about your meeting here in Houston.  Thanks for getting into that.  It sounds like exactly what we needed.  I have been talking to Barbara and she will check with Frank concerning the letter.

I'll look forward to chatting sometime soon so I can hear what's been happening with you and how you are coping.  Hope it is all going as smoothly as possible.  Linda tells me that New York is a changed place -- nearly empty evenings and weekends.

Just so you know ahead of time what some of my questions will be:

1.  I'm a little concerned about the safety of in-mast furling systems generally.  What happens if it jams in a blow?
2.  Are the heads both electric?  Will they operate manually if you lose power?
3.  The boat seems remarkably well equipped.  What sorts of additional items are usual to purchase before she's ready to cruise?
4.  How do U.S. owners deal with the voltage issues and electrical repairs and replacements?

How much protection do the agreements give us?  I have always assumed that they were primarily for the benefit of the brokers.  Of course, in the U.S. they are probably required by the SEC and in a country where they are not required you have to wonder how well the brokers are being policed by regulators.  I guess it makes sense to at least contact local counsel to find out what protections there are for the customer and whether or not it would be reasonable to ask for something in writing.  I don't think we need written opinions of counsel.  It might also make sense to explain to the business folks that we think there is incrementally greater legal risk in using those arrangements and that while they may be permitted to use them they should keep activities to a minimum where there is a more secure alternative.

BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP


I am NURA USMAN, a management consultant in the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR), I am a member of the Tenders Board a Committee in charge of Contract Awards and Payment Approvals (C A P A). I got your contact during my quest for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very confidential transaction, which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account

There were series of contracts executed by a consortium of Multinationals in the oil industry in favor of the (DPR) among which were;

1) The expansion of Pipeline network within Nigeria for crude oil and
downstream products distribution and subsequent evacuation. - USD$2 Billion.
2) Contract for Turn around Maintenance (TAM) at the various Refineries in the country.
3) The construction of Storage Tanks for Petroleum Product (Depots) -USD$94 Million.

The original value of these contracts were deliberately over invoiced to the tune of Thirty Six million, Five Hundred and sixty one thousand United States Dollars (USD$36,561,000.00) which has recently been approved and now ready to be transferred. However the companies that actually executed the aforementioned contract have been fully paid and the project officially commissioned.

Consequently, my colleagues and I are willing to transfer the total amount to your account for subsequent disbursement, since we as civil servants are prohibited by the Code of Conduct Bureau (Civil Service Laws) from opening and/ or operating foreign accounts in our names.

Needless to say, the trust reposed on you at this juncture is enormous. In return, we have agreed amongst ourselves to offer you 20% of the transferred sum, while 10% shall be set aside for any incidental expenses during the course of this transaction, you will then be mandated to revert the balance 70% to us in due course, or as will be advised in due course.
You must however NOTE that this transaction is subject to the following
terms and conditions; Our conviction of your transparent honesty and
diligence, that you must accord this transaction with utmost confidentiality and secrecy.

Modalities have been worked out at the highest levels of the Ministry of
Finance, Central Bank of Nigeria and the Presidential Task Force on Contract Payment for the immediate remittance of the funds within 10 - 14 working days subject to your satisfaction of the above stated terms. Our assurance is that the risk involved with your role shall be reduced to the barest minimal. To accord this transaction the legality it deserves, and for mutual security of the funds, the whole approval procedures shall be legally processed with your name or any company you may nominate as the bona fide beneficiary of the funds.

Once more, I want you to understand that having put in over 20 years of
meritorious service to my country, I am very much averse to having my image and career dented. This matter should therefore be treated with utmost secrecy and urgency. Kindly expedite action as we are well behind
schedule to enable us include this transfer in the Second quarter of the 2001 fiscal year contractual payments.

Do confirm your interest with a return email to usm2001ng@onebox.com

Thank You.

REGARDS,

NURA USMAN."

Dear Mark,

Thanks for keeping us updated on Tom. I am pleased to hear that he is making a good recovery. Please pass on our best wishes. I am wondering whether the hospital will have forwarded mum's card if he had already moved on to a convalescent home when it arrived. I have just sent a card to his home address but I do not have the post code. I hope it gets there.

I found out from Graham last night that he is returning to Somerset on Wednesday (23rd). I guess that makes it unlikely that you will get to see him this time. There is a strong possibility that he will come in October for the Jazz festival and will bring Jordan with him. Whilst he has been here he has had lots of people trying to persuade him to build houses for them, but I think he misses Jordan so much he can't wait to get home. I am amazed at how much work got done so quickly. The house in Lauragh is finished except for the painting, wood staining and floor varnishing. We can start using it now but we need to avoid putting in too much furniture until the floor is done in some of the rooms at least. Dad has been lending a hand with paths and garden walls and has helped with some painting. I am sure that Mum will help with some planting. All I need now is a couple of really nice weeks in the summer so that I can feel the benefit of it.

I hope you can find time to come over again sometime soon. When Alan returns from Vienna next week he should be in a much more relaxed mood, having got his conference presentation out of the way at last. I am sure he will be happy to spend some leisurely days with you and to take you down to Mum and Dad's and to see the house, etc. If Hilary still has her yacht when you come she might also be glad of some help to sail it. She has not ventured out in it since Richard died but is talking about sailing it if she can find some help.

Once the next month is over I can also relax a bit. We are just coming into exam time and we all get very fraught at this time of year (with the marking piling up).

At last the foot and mouth restrictions are lifting a bit and we are hoping that all riding activities can gradually resume. We have had a rather boring few months - not even able to ride out along the roads. We can now ride down to the beach but we still have to take care not to go near fields full of cattle or sheep! I have just started investigating the idea of a pony for Caitlin. She is riding my horse occasionally in the sand arena and is doing very well with him even though he is rather small for him. I think she might be ready for a pony now but finding the right one is not going to be easy.

We will look forward  to seeing you whenever you can manage to get flights.

Bye for now,

Deb

I would like to ask a follow-up question:

Do we lose the benefit of the special treatment under the bankruptcy code when we enter into cross-product (i.e. physical and financial products) netting and joint credit support arrangements.  If we agree with a counterparty to net all of our trading exposures under multiple agreements (swap agreements and gas, power, steel, coal, etc. trading agreements) to determine how much credit support should be posted and then only ask for a single LC that supports the whole shebang, do we lose this protection since arguably we are no longer just ""under a swap agreement?"""

We have thought about this from time to time.  Our primary concern has not been the strict adherence to the contractual notice requirements (because of the lack of substantive concern you mention) but the fear of possible waiver of rights that might take place if the requests are not consistent or handled carefully.  These are all issues that apply to trading margin calls generally.  Most recently Carol St. Clair, who Mark H. has asked to be the point lawyer for Credit and credit issues, has been working on this problem.

Mark, I recently was dealing with Russell in Credit on a margin call letter for IMC Canada and it seemed to me that the letter in substance met Credit's requirements but did not comply with the ISDA in terms of formalities (i.e. use of defined terms, currency specification, notice and delivery timing, notice addresses, etc.).  It seemed to me that the form they are using may have been drafted some time ago and needs to be updated so that it is not a drafting exercise on a case by case basis.  Practically, to the extent that the counterparty will not object to delivery, there really is no substantive concern.  However, as credit is becoming a significant issue in commodity markets, if the counterparty wants to object, particularly in circumstances where their credit is getting ""tight"", I can see the lack of contractual compliance perhaps being problematic.  Can somebody in your group develop a template (perhaps a few will be required) that could be used under the Enron form, the ""industrial"" form, the ISDA form and for Canada.  Please call Russell, Bill or me to discuss.  Peter."

June 7, 2001
Notice No. 01-191

TO:
ALL NYMEX DIVISION MEMBERS
ALL NYMEX DIVISION CLEARING MEMBERS / MEMBER FIRMS

FROM:
NEAL WOLKOFF, EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT

RE:
EXCHANGE TO SUBSTITUTE POSITION ACCOUNTABILITY REQUIREMENTS FOR POSITION LIMIT RULES

The board of directors of the New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc., has approved substituting position accountability requirements for the current position limits on all but the last three trading days of its crude oil, heating oil, unleaded gasoline, and natural gas contracts, beginning with the Friday, June 15, trading session.

For the last three days of trading in a particular delivery month, each of those contracts would continue to have a position limit of 1,000 lots.

The current net position limits levels will be reflected in the accountability levels. These are:

			Any one month	        All months
Crude oil		10,000			20,000
Unleaded gasoline	5,000			7,000
Heating oil		5,000			7,000
Natural gas		7,000			12,000



Any market participant with positions exceeding these levels may be contacted by the Exchange with inquiries regarding the participant's hedging requirements or financial condition. The Exchange would reserve the right to require that the position be reduced or capped.

There will no longer be any gross limits on the number of positions that can be held, as long as they are offset by positions on the opposite side of the market (example: a participant with 10,000 long positions in September, October, and November crude oil futures and 10,000 short positions for December and January would be considered to have a net position of 10,000 contracts).

These new rules are also intended to apply to the Brent crude oil futures contract, planned for launch this summer. The board has also approved a minimum reporting level of 100 lots for that contract.

These rules, which closely resemble those in place for metals traded on the COMEX Division, must be approved by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission prior to implementation."

,06/12/2001,,mark.taylor@enron.com,ted.bockius@ivita.com,,Article,"February/March 2001 Issue  Enron Unveils Storage Trades Enron Broadband has completed a series of deals in the data storage market, commoditising this fast-growing area for the first time. It acted as a market maker, purchasing storage capacity from StorageNetworks - which was then sold on to Best Buy, a retailer of electronics products. Crucially, both contracts were based on Enron's standard contract and included firm delivery with liquidated damages.  In the last few years the storage market has moved from being a self-managed and owned business to one where storage is served up from a standard metro network. Enron's involvement will be bring flexibility of contract offering and imbedded optionality, according to Ravi Thuraisingham, a senior trader at Enron. ""When we sell the product to the customer we remain in the market to buy the capacity back should they wish to unwind their position later. That is unprecedented,"" says Thuraisingham.   The storage market has historically been more flexible and more committed to firm delivery than the bandwidth market, but these trades mark a significant development. Rather than dated damages the storage market has tended to favour discounts on future purchases. ""There is a premium in the price for firm delivery,"" says Thuraisingham.  He says that a number of other market participants are eager to commit to Enron as a market maker. In addition, equipment vendors are excited by the possibilities of the market. ""most storage equipment at the moment is supplied to the enterprise market. This development opens up the wholesale storage capacity market,"" says Thuraisingham."
,06/12/2001,,mark.taylor@enron.com,ted.bockius@ivita.com,,Another Article,"Broadband Networking News  Mark Holmes 03/27/2001  Enron Hits Back Quickly After Blockbuster Failure Houston-based energy and communications conglomerate Enron's Enron Broadband Services unit signed a deal with Electronics Boutique earlier this month to deliver video games on demand in a bid to boost content offerings to its broadband customers as part of its entertain-on-demand (EOD) service.  Under the terms of the March 19 deal, Electronics Boutique subsidiary EBWorld.com will stream leading games for rental to Enron 's broadband customers. The deal is a positive development for Enron after the collapse of a deal with Blockbuster, which the companies announced March 9, that would have given Enron exclusive rights to deliver movies for a video-on-demand service.   ""The exclusive relationship has not yielded the quantity and quality of movies needed to drive demand for this exciting new on-demand service,"" explains Kenneth D. Rice, president and CEO of Enron Broadband Services.  ""The Blockbuster announcement was disappointing, but I do think the technology and systems to be able to do that are virtually complete,"" notes James Yannello, a utilities equity analyst at UBS Warburg. ""I do think they will be able to potentially a deliver a variety of items to end-users. I would guess they need to do some more deals, driving traffic on [to] their systems. I think they can bounce back pretty quickly from the Blockbuster deal. I think the blow was more psychological and I would suggest it was used as an excuse for some others to lower some very aggressive price targets on the company, which is what they did.""  The failure of the Blockbuster deal was a blow for the company as the exclusive 20-year agreement could have given Enron significant upside in the content delivery business.   ""I don't see Blockbuster as being a broadband killer for Enron ,"" Bob Christensen, a utilities equity analyst at First Albany Corp., tells Broadband Networking News. ""I think they will probably [get] one or two anchor tenants before the year is out. I am optimistic.""  The deal with Electronics Boutique and the failure of the deal with Blockbuster emphasize the importance Enron is placing on securing content for its broadband network. Yet its main revenues from the telecom arena will continue to be derived from its bandwidth intermediation business, which uses pooling points to provide the physical interconnectivity between bandwidth buyers and sellers, allowing users to provide bandwidth on demand. This is Enron 's core telecom business.  The content deals, while important, are not being factored into most analysts' forecasts on the company.   ""I am confident that the content delivery business will be successful,"" says Ray Niles, a utilities equity analyst at Salomon Smith Barney. ""The fact of the matter is they did get another deal. It was not as large as the Blockbuster deal, but they did get another one in there. We are not putting numbers in our model and our earnings forecast for content delivery. Whether it is very successful or not very successful, in our forecasts, we are not assuming any particular forecast for the content delivery business. I think bandwidth intermediation is their competitive advantage.""  ""The reality is that no one had any earnings (from Blockbuster) in the company projections for several years at best,"" Yannello adds. ""It was a big name and was portrayed to be the killer app. It is disappointing, but I do think they will be able to bounce back with other deals. I also think in an early sense this gaming announcement is probably the tip of the iceberg of what they will be able to bring in.""  Enron, which produced revenues of over $101 billion in 2000 from its various businesses, is still rated highly by analysts, despite the failure of the Blockbuster deal.   ""We have a $100 target price and a 'strong buy' rating,"" Yannello says. ""That assumes roughly $75 of value for their energy business and $25 of value for their broadband services division. I think given what has happened in the broader market in the telecom arena, and given that the Blockbuster deal has falling apart, I think we be will waiting a while before we expand that $25 telecom valuation."""

Changes to Descriptions of US Physical Gas Products Delivered Within Texas 

Due to the recent sale of the Houston Pipe Line Company by Enron, which was effective June 1st 2001, the Product Long Descriptions of US Physical Gas products for which the Delivery Point is located in Texas have been amended.  Instead of ""Houston Pipe Line Company,"" your new counterparty for these transactions executed in the future will be ""Enron North America Corp.""

This change affects EnronOnline physical natural gas products delivered at Carthage, Exxon Katy and Waha locations. We have added the following language to the Product Long Descriptions of these affected products: 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the General Terms and Conditions, if applicable, this Transaction is between Counterparty and Enron North America Corp.

This language will supersede the language in the first clause of your ""General Terms and Conditions"" (GTC) agreement, which presently states, ""In the event that the Delivery Point for a transaction is located in the state of Texas, ""Enron"" shall mean Houston Pipe Line Company.""

Our neighborhood usually doesn't have too much trouble but the velocity of the rain (at one point they say it was 6"" per hour) was so high that it just couldn't drain away that fast.  The water got so high that it was several inches high in the garage (not high enough to get in the car), covered the pool and completely surrounded the house.  It looks like it covered the porch and got right up to the top of the slab since some of the floor boards are starting to warp, but not as high as the door sills since none actually came in.  Just one more inch and I'd be in big trouble.  Luckily I slept through the whole thing - if I'd been awake I would have totally freaked and started carrying rugs & furniture to the second floor -- a lot of trouble and anxiety for nothing since it never did come inside.  The garage apt. tenant parks on the street and her car had water inside and it wouldn't start without being jumped.  I got home about midnight the night it happened and it was raining but the street was clear -- no standing water anywhere.  By the time I got up in the morning it was all gone.

Interstate 10 where it goes near our place (say from downtown out to the loop) looked like a river - the water filled the entire thing all the way up to the bottoms of the overpass bridges!  I didn't see it myself but I hear that 59 was the same way where it dips down between Montrose and Shepherd.  You missed a big one!"

That is what it looks like in the Baltic Exchange Limited publication.  I haven't seen the IITRA publication so can't comment on how their quotations are denominated.  The problem is that in the first paragraph of the long description, the Floating Price is defined to be the Index.  Therefore the Index must be a currency denominated number.

We have approved doing away with confirms for EOL trades on a counterparty by counterparty basis.  We haven't actually gotten there with anyone yet, having just started the actual discussions this week.  Our plan was to negotiate an written agreement with each affected counterparty to amend the master agreements where appropriate.  Initially we are only working on physical power, physical natural gas and derivatives transactions (other than weather).  The idea is that a lawyer from each affected group would be involved to insure that all of the bases are properly covered.  This will obviously be a very time-consuming and laborious process.  The initial list of 10 or 15 counterparties to approach was selected by the back office people.  Our conclusion that this was even possible was based only on Texas and New York law analysis.  If any Canadian deals are at issue, we will need to get you involved both for the analysis and the negotiations.

Hope this is helpful.  Let me know if it makes sense to you.

Thanks for getting back to me with your analysis.  Here's what I've done:

Not sure what the situation is with the Lead Expediter (95%) position -- the phone line of the manager for that one doesn't seem to be working and an e-mail to him was returned as undeliverable -- even though his name was in the company e-mail address book.  But he's in the same department as one of the jobs below (Sr. Purchasing Agent I think), and this position is a more junior slot, so you probably want to be considered for the more senior position first anyway.

The Senior Project Manager (80-90%) and Senior Purchasing Agent (80%) slots are still open.  I talked briefly to the managers listed on the postings and have forwarded your resume to them for consideration.  I have no feel for the timing on the Proj. Mgr. position and in fact the manager was a bit brusque, but the guy on the Purch. Agent job said the timing was great since he's taking a stack of resumes home with him this weekend to review.

I've left voice-mail messages concerning the Construction Engineer (90%) and Process/Mechanical Engineer II (80%) positions and will forward your resume if they are still looking.

 On the others, it might make sense to go ahead and go through the application process on the website.  Particularly for the one that says not to contact them directly -- there's no pointing in making them mad before they even see your resume!

I'll keep you posted on the others.  If there are no answers to my voicemails by the middle to end of next week, you might want to submit for those on the website, too.  At least then you know your resume is in the hopper.

I have a single in the same class (so we eat in the same restaurant).  My plan would be to fly over on Sunday evening - the 26th - since I have to be in Ohio that morning.  With that in mind I have also booked jr. suites for us at ""41"" the all-inclusive London hotel near Buckingham Palace that I've mentioned to you before.  They are at 275 GBP per night (2 nights).  Of course, if you guys wanted to go earlier to spend more time in London, I am sure that would be possible.

The difficulty is that Amanda has indicated an interest in staying in Europe longer - certainly understandable.  Her preference would be to go over on the boat leaving NY on September 5, arriving in Southampton Sept. 10 and then stay in Europe for a few weeks.  That doesn't work quite as well for me because I only have 6 vacation days left and on that routing I get one less day in London - i.e. we get off the boat on Monday morning and I have to fly back Tuesday morning.  On the other hand, we wouldn't be jet lagged on arrival in London!

The lease automatically converts to a month-to-month lease at the beginning of August at the same rent.  That means that from then on either one of us can cancel with 30 days notice to the other if they want to.  That's ok with me if it works for you.

I don't know if that information is stored in a searchable format but there is definitely a customer database that has profiles stored for each customer and determines what they have access to on the system.  My guess is that the only way to answer the question is for someone to sit down with the list of all customers and try and figure out which ones are utilities -- a less than perfect process but one that would give you a ballpark number.

I think the correct approach is to revise the functionality and add a line or two to the description of how limit orders work, an answer in the FAQ section, a line for the 'Failed Transaction' screen and a script for the help desk.  I'm thinking of something to the effect of:

Once a limit order has been placed by a counterparty, that counterparty will not be able to complete a transaction with Enron in that product on the other side of the market at the price specified in the limit order.  For example, if a counterparty enters a limit order to sell to Enron at price x, that counterparty may not buy from Enron at price x while the limit order is active.

Note that this needs to be done on a counterparty basis, not at the sub user level.  That needs to be clear from the language we use so I have avoided the chattier 'you' and used counterparty.

The 'Failed Transaction' screen could show the failure reason as:

'Your company has an active limit order in effect at the price at which you attempted to transact.  The limit order system does not allow you to transact with Enron on both sides of the market at the same price simultaneously.'

If you want to keep it short, the second sentence is optional as long as the necessary descriptive language appears somewhere on the web site.

FERTILIZERS

It's time to manage your price risk.

[Spread 1]
Managing Price Risk
For producers and consumers of ammonia and fertilizers, price volatility is an all-too-familiar cost of doing business. To compete effectively in your industry, you need a way to control the risk created by price volatility. Enron can help with financial price management tools that can smooth earnings, facilitate cash flow management, and bring greater certainty to financing, investment and acquisition decisions. 
 
Helping Ammonia and Fertilizer Producers Improve their Business
Few industries are more competitive or volatile than ammonia or fertilizers. From the very unstable pricing found in the markets for raw materials to the ebb and flow of market demand for finished products, producers can face enormous challenges in maintaining profit margins and cash flows.
Now there's help. For many years, Enron has been helping producers like you neutralize the risk of price volatility both upstream and downstream, using financial price management tools we pioneered more than a decade ago for the energy industry. Because Enron is a major trader of many commodities around the world, we're intimately familiar with the risks you face and are uniquely positioned to help you mitigate them. 
Enron can also make it easier for you to trade the commodities you buy and sell, using EnronOnline, our Internet-based, global transaction system for commodities that allows you to view real-time prices and transact instantly online. EnronOnline posts bid and offer prices for over 1,500 global commodity products as well as complimentary weather, news and market information. In addition, it allows you to view full contractual terms and available volumes for products.
[Spread 2]
Finally, we can leverage, in your market, our position as the largest wholesaler of natural gas and electricity in North America. For example, we can structure cross-commodity transactions that link your electricity or natural gas bills to the price of the goods you produce. In this type of transaction, you would pay more for energy when your product prices are high when you can best afford it, and less when your product prices are low and your cash flows are constrained.

Helping Ammonia and Fertilizer Consumers Improve their Business

The ammonia and fertilizer markets that you depend upon are among the most volatile in the world. Yet your investors and lenders are demanding ever-greater stability in the growth of your company's revenues, earnings and cash-flow. For solutions to this apparent paradox, turn to Enron. As a leading provider of price management services across various industries, we can help you buy the commodities you need more efficiently, hedge the risks associated with their pricing, and, ultimately, lower your cost of capital. 
Take a few moments to review the alternatives listed here, then spend a few more moments with Enron. We'll review your risk exposure with you and suggest risk-reducing strategies for taking control of your commodity price exposure.

SWAPS

Swaps are the most widely used price risk management tool for a variety of reasons, the most common being, no upfront transaction cost. 
Swaps give companies the ability to effectively switch from one price structure to another - from floating price to fixed or vice versa. They are used most often to fix, or lock in, prices and margins between prices. In exchange for price protection, the ability to capitalize on some beneficial price movements is sacrificed.
The typical swap transaction involves the exchange of a fixed price for a variable price tied to an acceptable market index. Settlement is financial - i.e., cash changes hands; physical product does not. Each month during the life of the transaction, the difference between the two prices is calculated and payment is made to the appropriate party.
[Spread 4]

Swap: Producer example 

AmmoniaKing, a producer of ammonia, is interested in managing the margin between natural gas feedstock and ammonia during the next six months. The company is concerned that market conditions could deteriorate more than expected and squeeze margins to the point of jeopardizing the annual profit plan. To eliminate this threat, AmmoniaKing enters into a swap with Enron that locks in the spread between natural gas and ammonia at $100/ton on 300,000 tons of ammonia, or 75 percent of monthly production. This margin virtually ensures that the ammonia unit will meet its financial target.
[chart 1]

DURING THE LIFE OF THE SWAP:

?        AmmoniaKing continues to purchase natural gas from suppliers and sell ammonia to customers of its choice, at floating market prices.
?        On a monthly basis, AmmoniaKing and Enron exchange payments equal to the difference between the fixed spread of $100/ton and the prevailing floating price spread.
?        For example, if the floating spread is $95/ton in a given month, AmmoniaKing will receive $5/ton in a given month on 300,000 tons. However, if the floating spread is $105/ton AmmoniaKing will owe $5/ton to Enron.
?        AmmoniaKing has stabilized a portion of its operating margin with the swap, giving the company the ability to achieve a key performance target.
 
[Spread 5]

Swap: End-user example 

FertPro, a manufacturer of a variety of fertilizer products, is preparing its annual price catalog for many of its ammonia-based products. The company's customer base demands the ability to buy the products at the listed catalog price regardless of ammonia feedstock prices. This makes it impossible for FertPro to pass on feedstock price increases no matter what the magnitude. On the other hand, customers don't necessarily expect lower prices if ammonia feedstock prices should fall; they simply want a listed price they can count on. To service its customers while protecting its margins, FertPro enters into a one-year price swap. The swap effectively fixes the price of ammonia at $100/ton on a monthly volume of 10,000 tons, or 75 percent of anticipated monthly catalog sales.
[chart 2]

DURING THE LIFE OF THE SWAP:

?        FertPro continues to purchase ammonia from suppliers of its choice at floating market prices.
?        On a monthly basis, FertPro and Enron exchange payments equal to the difference between the swap fixed price of $100/ton and the floating price for ammonia.
?        For example, if the floating price for ammonia is $105 in a given month, FertPro will receive $5/ton on 10,000 tons. However, if the floating price is $95/ton FertPro will owe $5/ton to Enron.
?        The net effect of combining the swap cash flows with actual purchases of ammonia feedstock is a fixed price of $100/ton.
?        The swap enables FertPro to publish and stand behind its listed prices with full confidence that the margin on those sales is largely protected from fluctuating feedstock prices.
 
[Spread 6]

CAPS & FLOORS

Like Swaps, Caps and Floors provide price protection, but they have the added advantage of providing benefit from favorable price movements. They are commonly thought of as price ""insurance,"" i.e., for a premium you are entitled to full price protection when prices move through a specified level. A price Cap protects against rising prices without sacrificing the advantage of falling prices. Floors are the opposite of Caps; they guard against falling prices while preserving upside price potential.
With a Cap or Floor, the full cost of the protection is predefined - it is equal to the premium paid for the Cap or Floor. There are no potential future costs related to price movements.
[Spread 7]

Cap: End-User example

CropFood, a manufacturer of urea, wants to develop business with a prospect that has difficulty passing on price increases, but is expected to pass on decreases without delay.
To distinguish itself from competitors, CropFood ensures the prospect that for the next 12 months, CropFood will never ask for a price increase above its very competitive product prices, no matter how high ammonia feedstock prices go. And to sweeten the deal, CropFood agrees to promptly pass on all feedstock price decreases as soon as they are announced, no questions asked.
The prospect likes CropFood's straightforward pricing policy and agrees to purchase 1,000 tons of urea per month. In order to honor its pricing promise without putting the company's margins at risk to rising prices, CropFood purchases a one-year price cap on ammonia at $120/ton for 12,000 tons per month. The cost of the cap is $2/ton.
[chart 3]

DURING THE LIFE OF THE CAP AGREEMENT:

?        CropFood continues to buy ammonia from its regular suppliers at market prices.
?        Enron receives a $2/ton premium from CropFood for the $120/ton price cap.
?        If the market price for ammonia goes above $120/ton in a given month, Enron will pay the difference to CropFood. If prices are less than $120/ton, CropFood enjoys the lower market prices for its feedstock.
?        The effective cost of ammonia paid by CropFood is the floating market price up to a maximum of $120/ton plus the $2/ton premium paid for the cap.
?        CropFood has, for a known cost of $2/ton captured new business by meeting the customer's price needs without putting the company at risk to ammonia prices in the process.
 
[Spread 8]

Floor: Producer example

AmmoniaKing, a producer of ammonia, anticipates a plant turnaround starting in three months time and lasting for two months. The company intends to build extra ammonia inventory of 50,000 tons over the next three months to meet sales obligations during the two-month period the plant is taken off-line. There is concern that prices could soften over the two-month turnaround period, squeezing the margin on the excess inventory to be sold during that time.
To protect against a sharp price reduction during the turnaround period, AmmoniaKing buys a two-month ammonia price floor today that becomes effective in three months time. The floor price is set at $145 and costs $3/ton. The total premium payable by AmmoniaKing is $150,000 (50,000 tons multiplied by $3/ton).
[chart 4]
 

EACH MONTH DURING THE LIFE OF THE PRICE FLOOR:

?        AmmoniaKing sells excess ammonia inventory to its customers at prevailing market (floating) prices.
?        Enron receives a $3/ton premium from AmmoniaKing for the $145/ton price floor.
?        If the floating price for ammonia is greater than the $145/ton floor price, there is no action under the floor contract. The effective price received by AmmoniaKing for its ammonia is the floating market price less the $3/ton premium.
?        If the floating price goes below the $145/ton floor price to $140/ton, for example, AmmoniaKing will receive the $5/ton difference from Enron. In this instance, AmmoniaKing effective price for ammonia is $142/ton - the $145/ton floor price less the $3/ton premium.
?        In summary, the price floor has established a minimum price of $145/ton with full upside potential at a known cost of $3/ton.

I know it's hard to think about work issues much less concentrate, but it seems to me we need to start thinking about market disruption issues right away.  The NYMEX is the obvious issue and we need to find out which counterparties have affected transactions (such as using average of the entire month of NYMEX prices) and then review the relevant documentation.  With any luck there won't be many.  We also need to be alert to other price sources that might fail to publish.

I haven't been back to NYC since I left on the QE2 on 9/4.  Every time I heard about the conditions downtown I assumed you would be living in the country.  Sorry to hear you had to spend so much time in a hotel.  I know what that can be like and it loses any appeal it ever had very quickly.  Also sorry to hear about Mrs. B.  I hope she is doing better.

It has been chaotic and very depressing here -- not that our acquisition deal went through but that we ever got in the position to need the deal to go through in the first place.  In fact, when they finally announced it, my primary feeling was one of relief.  Things had gotten very bad.  Next time we get together I can fill you in on all the details.  At least for now I am still employed and my prospects are pretty good under the circumstances.

It's nice you have Key West to get away to.  You'll have to tell me about the house that you have available but under the circumstances I doubt that I could get away often enough to justify taking on a lease.  It would be nice to get away from here now and then though.  I was supposed to go to Ft. Lauderdale (did you know Ted was living there now?) a few weeks ago to visit and go to the big boat show there.  That trip had to be cancelled in all the confusion around here.  I had hoped to be in New York today for a seminar (where I was actually scheduled to speak) but cancelled that also.  With luck things will start to get back to normal here soon.  I'm really feeling the need for a break (and 4 days in Cincinnati next week don't count) so maybe I can come visit some time in the next couple of months.

I left you a voice mail this morning on your cell phone to let you know I'm OK and stranded in London.  Not a bad place to get stranded I suppose.  Linda and Amanda are here, too.  I'm working from the office here while they have fun on the town.  Actually, they seem to be spending a lot of time at the hotel watching the news, and I can't say that I totally blame them -- it seems almost disloyal to go out and have fun.  They were going to a play this afternoon and got tickets for us to see Mama Mia (the musical based on ABBA) for tomorrow night.  I was originally scheduled to fly back yesterday (Wednesday) and have been rebooked on a flight Sunday afternoon.  The hotel finally told me this morning that we can keep our rooms until then.  I hope the flights are running by then.

Kitty is being taken care of but I feel really bad having her be alone all this time.  Jim Avant was stranded in Austin for a day -- they had to take a taxi back to Houston the next day -- and Jamie said they would go over that afternoon.  

If you need to reach me, you can try the office number 011-44-207-783-6468, my UK cell phone number 011-44-778-351-2535 or the hotel number 011-44-207-491-7282.  It's kind of hard to get through some times since the lines to the US are often busy.

Hope you are doing ok through all this.  I'm just sort of numb.

,11/28/2001,,.taylor@enron.com,.taylor@enron.com,,RE: VMAC Transaction,"I think there is a real possibility here.  It would be extremely challenging commercially.

How do we convince customers to participate?
Two distinct areas:  (i) Existing portfolio of business and (ii) New business.

New business is easier in one sense since everything is at the money, who would say no to a AAA credit?  Still requires significant amendment to existing trading documentation and where existing trades are present, separating them out as not netting with new trades.

Existing business is easy for counterparties who are already in the money -- they will want the improved credit.  But how do we convince the out of the money side of the equation to participate?  This seem to me to be the biggest hurdle.


Issues:

Requires consent of customers and significant amendment of existing contracts.
	Adequate incentive for customers currently out of the money to participate?
	Might make more sense where no current positions exist.
	
Contract hurdles:

	Need to allow for termination by defaulting party so Enron (VMAC) will be able to control termination on default.
	Need the consent of counterparty to assign contract to VMAC.
	May require changing permitted credit support from counterparties (letters of credit probably don't work).

If we are attempting to put an existing book of business into the structure, an initial chunk of money will have to be given to VMAC to secure the existing out of the money side of the portfolio - how much is it and do we have that money?

It's not clear how the proposal allows for credit lines to and from counterparties.  That is, if we have given an aggregate $200 million credit line to out of the money counterparties and have only been given an aggregate $100 million credit line to in the money counterparties, will VMAC be satisfied with the mismatch.  Will we continue to control the amount of credit we give to customers?  If we go to 100% collateral requirements for all participating transactions, this is solved since there can't be a mismatch.  (Will customers agree to 100% collateral requirements - i.e. no credit lines?)

Once the supported/participating portfolio is out of the money, Enron will have to post collateral to VMAC.  If we fail, VMAC can default all participating/supported contracts.  

When all of the contracts are terminated with Enron as the defaulting party, the payments to and from counterparties are calculated on their side of the market.  Presumably VMAC will require some cushion to cover this."

I was originally scheduled to fly back yesterday (Wednesday) but of course all the flights were cancelled yesterday and today.  With luck they'll be back up to full schedules by Sunday when I have a reservation.  I'll let you know if that changes.  

It's interesting to hear what your reactions were since they very closely parallel my own.  I heard as I was coming back into the office after lunch on Tuesday and there was a small group standing around a computer screen watching an internet news feed.  My first reaction was that it had to be some kind of elaborate internet hoax and I still have a sense of disbelief.  I dread my next trip to New York when I will have to see the skyline with my own eyes.  Linda and Amanda are also stranded here and they tend to spend a lot of time watching the news.  After the first hour or so I just couldn't bear to watch and preferred to check in now and then for updates.  But then what else was there to do except sit and be stunned.  Even today it's still hard to concentrate on much of anything.  I guess in a sense I'm lucky that I have work matters to keep me busy.  Unfortunately, some are directly related to the tragedy.  There's no doubt the world changed on Tuesday and this will always be with us in some way.

All sorts of odd thoughts keep coming to mind.  I have wondered several times if Dad remembers when he and I went into one of the towers (it must have been when they were quite new) and tried to get to the top to see the view.  We were told there was no public observation area so we just took an elevator up as far as we could get and got out on a floor that was still under construction and went over to the windows to marvel at the view.  Remember the view from my apartment in New York?  And I was on the QE2 the last time it will ever go past those buildings (forgive the bad grammar but you know what I mean).

We're going to try and have as good a time as possible here.  I'm working during the days and joining Linda and Amanda for dinner in the evening.  Tomorrow we're going to see a West End musical.  Saturday we'll probably go to a couple of museums.  Hope you are keeping well.

This e-mail is attempting to answer the request made by you and Scott a few weeks ago. 

Attached are my projected balance for 2004 NOx SIP CALL.  It is based on numbers from EEA (environment consultants), EPA website, NOx SIP Call model, and new generation database.  The confidence level for overall balance is not that high.  The OTR states only need to reduce 15% from 2001 to 2003 to be in compliance.  They have some SCRs already built and the plans for the other SCRs needed.  The non-OTR states are far more dirty than the OTR states.  The big question mark is the cost of technology that will be available for the 2004 states.  I believe that there will be a demand for allowances.  I believe the NOx SIP Call market to be a short at this point.  People think it is worse than it really is.

Also, I can make a price forecast.  The confidence level would be low on the price forecast.  What else do you want here?  

 

Mike Taylor"
,11/26/2001,,e.taylor@enron.com,john.massey@enron.com,,NOx OTR flow control,"FYI . . .

Below is written by our environmental consultant EEA
Based on the preliminary emissions data for 2001 just 
released, the allowance surplus for this year is 23,189 tons 
bringing the total bank at the end of the year to 83,778 tons.  This 
would mean a flow control value of 0.26 or a discount factor of 0.63 
for 2002.  The exact flow control/discount values cannot be 
calculated right now because they will depend on how many 
banked allowances are used for compliance this year and also on 
the implementation of the Maryland consent decree which the state 
and EPA probably wont figure out until next year.  But we are 
pretty much in that range.

Linda and I both had to reschedule our flights and did it directly with the airline (Continental for me and Virgin for Linda).  Of course, in our cases the original flights were cancelled.  I don't have the Cunard reservations number here and haven't been able to access the web site this afternoon.  I will get it for you when I get home.  The fax number for the guest relations department is (305)463-3030.

In a sense I felt safer in London than here.  Once we got off the QE2 we weren't doing anything that would have made us attractive targets and I don't anticipate attacks against individual Americans overseas -- at least not outside of Muslim countries.  While there was an increase in police presence around town, we didn't hear of any actual threats to Americans while we were in London.  Airport security has been better there than here for a long time and now has been beefed up even further.  The Europeans just have more recent experience at dealing with terrorists than we do.  The sword rattling doesn't bother me too much.  I've been overseas during some tense international times before and as long as you're in a friendly country it shouldn't be an issue.  On the other hand, it REALLY feels good to be home and I can sure understand your wanting to have her with you.

Party A calculates that it is in the money $100 (which results in a ""Loss"" to Party A from the termination)
Party B calculates that it is out of the money $98 (which results in a ""Gain"" to Party B from the termination)
There are no Unpaid Amounts

The Payment Amount is 50 percent of ($100 + $98) = $99
Since the Payment Amount is positive Party B (the Party with the net Gain) pays $99 to Party A (the party with the net Loss)



Example 2

Same as example 1 except Party A owes $150 in Unpaid Amounts to Party B and Party B owes Party A $12 in Unpaid Amounts

The Payment Amount is (a) 50 percent of ($100 + $98) plus (b) $12 minus (c) $150 = negative $39
Since the Payment Amount is negative Party A (the party with the net Loss) pays $39 to Party B (the party with the net Gain)

The time we care is when the internet slows down or the connection goes down and they don't see that we accepted their offer and then they try to get out.  I guess the other question would be how do they withdraw the offer?  The website doesn't provide a mechanism for that.

Just so you have the whole picture -- our analysis from a US law perspective is that there is a tension between wanting the transactions on the system to be enforceable and wanting out of the mistake trades.  The offline unwind is by far the best approach when the mistake is not blatant since it assumes the binding nature of the original trade.  We have been handling these by using a written termination rather than a reverse trade.  This is universally the approach we have taken when our traders have agreed to let a customer out of a trade the customer claims was done by mistake on their part.  This happens often enough that we have given the confirm desk a termination agreement form to use as needed (Tana can get you a copy if you want it).  But when the counterparty refuses to let us out of a trade that is a mistake on our part, our only hope is that the mistake is so blatant that we can claim mutual mistake.  Under US law when there is mutual mistake the contract is actually never formed.  In that case, the original trade is not enforceable and there is nothing to unwind.  One alternative we have used is to simply remove the transaction from the customer's ""completed transactions"" section as if it had never happened.  As far as I know, we have only had to do this once or twice."

We will definitely need a lot more information related to the items below.  
Please let me know when we can meet and discuss these.  Some of the items we 
will need to know include:

We discussed discrepancies your team noted between the spreadsheet positions 
that are being captured and what's reported on the Gas BM report.  This is 
causing you to manually adjust the Gas BM report.  Is this for all 
spreadsheet positions?  Some of them?  Is the variance significant?  Is it 
off everyday?  
What do you mean by "" All Transport Models"".   Does this mean positions?  Are 
transport positions on the Gas BM report?  Are they manual adjustments?  Are 
they in GRMS?  Can we capture these with spreadsheets?
What is your current methodology in preparing the Gas BM report for 
roll-offs?  Is it currently consistent across all regions or is it handled 
differently by different traders?  Please explain this in further detail. The 
Basis roll-off was done in the GRMS system in the past.  Is this still the 
case?  If not, we need to capture these roll-off adjustments using 
spreadsheets?
Can we make the Fixed Price Canadian Deals adjustments using spreadsheets 
that can be captured in GRMS?
Also, what is the status of capturing IM-Canada positions in the system?

We will need this type of information urgently.  We are meeting with Jeff 
Shankman on Tuesday to update him on the progress we are making.  

Please let me know if there is anything we can do to help.

,07/12/2001,,jason.wolfe@enron.com,krishna.lattupally@enron.com,,proposed sitara report,"Krishna,

I am looking to create a new report based on an existing sitara report that generates a deal list by pub code to estimate
various indexes during bid week. This was first made for Anne Bike, West Desk risk group.

The purpose of this new report is to generate a list of Desk-To-Desk deals for a given period and desk and generate a WACOG.
The parameters for this new query include:
Gas location (including All)
Desk (including All)

It should return to and from dates, volume, price, location, sitara number, tagg number, eol number (if any), and desk
It should generate subtotal volumes and WACOG for each desk, and each pipe location in each desk

Desks include: ENA - IM WSOCAL, ENA - IM WSJ, ENA - IM WKEYSTONE, ENA - IM WPGE, ENA - IM WROCKIES

If possible, the data should export into excel.

Thanks,
Jason Wolfe

 I'm sorry I'll be gone to Savanna when you planned to make your trip.
 I hope you'll be able to come with Beth another time this summer and also
come to Dad's retirement Beth is invited also.  Hopefully, you can fly here
in August.
 I'd been planning to call Janice Denny, then we ran into each other at
Wal-Mart yesterday and talked for at least 20 minutes. She asked about you
and she didn't know Jill and Matt had a baby. (So of course, I whipped out
my purse sized photo album.)
 Tonight she called and gave me Matt's e-mail address and I gave her yours.
 Matt and Mistie were here for Jamie's grad. but they had no time to visit
anyone.
 Here's Matt's address: pkpman@hotmail.com

,06/05/2001,,ashley.landry@enform.com,jason.wolfe@enron.com,,you love me,"Please answer all of the questions below... 
Are we going to look for a ring tomorrow?  
Do you know what size she wears? (I'm working on finding out myself) 
What time frame do you want to work with for an engagement? (Yes a TIME FRAME)  (ie, in a week, month, year...) 
I have the impression that beth wants you to take care of the whole wedding thing, is this true? 
She says she wants to go away (deffinately tropical because she has never seen blue water) and invite close family members (parents sibblings) and close friends by sending a letter/invitation.  She says they will need time to save if they are going to come, so I suggested 6 months.
Does this sound appealing to you? 
FYI... My brother went away to get married and I have a friend who went away so I have experience in planning tropical weddings.  They are great because only those who you want there come and others aren't affended for not being invited because y'all went away.  You can have a dream wedding for just a little more than what a nice vacation would cost.  It is alot cheaper than having one here which is probably important if y'all are paying for it.
What is my budget for the ring? 
What is my budget for the wedding? 
Please answer all of the questions above to the best of your ability.  This is crucial to the success of your engagement.  Thanks for your help!

Enron  is one of the world's leading electricity, natural gas and communications  companies.

Is this correct? I thought Enron didn't produce  electricity...or natural gas....just transported it....

Bob Hall will lead operations for Enron Americas. Bob previously served as one of the business controllers for gas operations for Enron Americas, with direct responsibility for Gas Logistics and Volume Management.  The leadership team reporting to Bob will include Peggy Hedstrom (Calgary Operations), Jeff Gossett ( U.S. Gas Risk and South America Operations), Stacey White (U.S. Power Risk), Leslie Reeves (U.S. Gas and Power Confirmations and Settlements), and Bob Superty (U.S. Gas Logistics). 

Brent Price will continue to lead Operations for Enron Global Markets and fulfill his dual role as Chief Accounting Officer for Enron Global Markets. 

I am very pleased to announce that Kevin Sweeney will lead Operations for Enron Industrial Markets.  Kevin brings to his new role extensive risk and operations experience from stints in our Houston, London and Singapore offices.  Kevin fills the role that was previously held by Brenda Herod, who will now report directly to Beth Apollo. 

Beth Apollo will be the Operations Project Manager for the assimilation of EES Wholesale. This will include Deal Capture, Risk Analysis,  Confirmations, and Global Data functions which have been moved into EWS under Global Risk Management Operations.  Successfully leveraging the infrastructure to support the EES business plan will also require close coordination with Gas Logistics, Settlements and the Operational Analysis (OA) process, and Beth will actively coordinate operations efforts with these teams and the commercial teams.  I have asked Beth to project manage the effort to look for opportunities to streamline and improve systems, processes and controls, and to consider alignment, where it makes sense, with existing EWS processes.  Reporting to Beth will be Scott Mills, with a focus on Deal Capture, Risk Analysis and Confirmations, and  Brenda Herod, with a focus on invoicing control guidelines and reporting requirements. 

Beth will also continue to manage the Global Services function, which includes the consolidated DPR process and Global Operations Standards, led by Shona Wilson, and the Global Data function which is lead by James Scribner.

Mike Jordan will continue to lead operations for Enron Europe, working closely with me and other EWS operations leads to insure the proliferation of best operational practices worldwide for Enron.   

Thanks for your continued support especially in exploring and seizing commercial opportunities to strengthen our contributions to Enron."

Kalmer are hosting the shower Sat.
I've got to drop somthing off at Jill and Matt's this morning heading to

 What have you been up to other than working?
 Dad has a Church Council meeting tonight so I'm sending some mail.
 I have to go shopping tomorrow for a bridal shower gift for Reagan Parsons.
She's getting married next month in Hawaii. Iris is living in St. Louis but
I haven't seen her in several months. Her sons introduced her to a nice guy
I've been told and they are hitting it off.
 We had some exciting local news today! The New Baden branch bank of First
Federal was robbed this a.m. by 3 armed men wearing costumes. No one was
hurt but one guy is still on the loose. Two vehicles led about 20 police
cars on a 110 mile an hour chase on 64 to a residential neighborhood in East
St. Louis. The story was on all 4 St. Louis stations today. Hopefully,
they'll have more details at 10.
 I'm working on salary negotiations for our union. Actually, it is for all
the educational support personnel as we are referred to now. I'm meeting
with my committe Thurs. to inform them what the Board has countered with.
The salary will be the sticky issue as usual. I hope we won't be working on
it all summer.
 Sandy and I had a great time as usual! I was worn out from laughing! We had
fun at our class reunion despite the lame attendance of our class--22
members (excluding spouses) out of 94. We stopped by Grandma and Grandpa's a
couple of times. Sandy and I also went to Galena one day.
 Tigger and Sweet Pea say ""hi"".  O.K.  I lied--they're sleeping! What a
surprise!
Have you gotten an airline ticket to come to Dad's retirement luncheon and
ceremony? Is Beth coming?
 Let us know how you're doing.

East Power Origination
On Friday, June 15, the Development Review Committee for Deerfield Beach, Florida, unanimously approved the 510 megawatt peaking power plant proposed for their city.  This approval followed on the heels of approval of the Developer's Agreement by the Deerfield Beach City Commission on Thursday, June 14.

Enron Industrial Markets
On Friday, June 8 Enron Industrial Markets closed transactions with Huntco Inc. under which EIM will provide inventory management services and will eventually provide more than 600,000 tons per year of hot-rolled, cold-rolled and galvanized steel products to Huntco Steel. The EIM project team developed a creative, 15-year structure that enhances Huntco's liquidity, reduces working capital requirements, and hedges their inventory position against directional price risk.  

In addition, EIM structured the acquisition of Huntco's cold mill and certain coil pickling operations.  A special purpose vehicle funded by third party equity now owns the assets, which continue to be operated by Huntco under an O&M agreement.  As part of the transaction, EIM purchased a 20-year call option on capacity at the cold mill located in Blytheville, Arkansas.  

These transactions with Huntco signal a fundamental change in the way steel is bought and sold in the United States.  They give Enron immediate access to physical steel and position Enron geographically to serve the steel industry in a variety of ways. Consummation of the Huntco transactions would not have been possible without the contributions of multiple Enron groups who enhanced value to Enron while significantly mitigating risk.

The primary goals were to 1) obtain low cost financing, 2) retain flexibility of the assets, and 3) minimize credit impact.  

Through the use of a derivatives package consisting of a warrant, a put, and a total return swap, EIM was able to redirect lenders exposure from operating, asset and commodity price risk to Enron credit risk. Consequently, our debt financing costs fell by over 400 bps.  Unlike other pulp and paper producers constrained by debt and operating covenants, EIM now has a significantly lower cost of capital plus the flexibility with its physical assets so that it may continue to revolutionize the pulp and paper industry without being burdened by restrictions typical in the industry. 

To alleviate the credit impact of purchasing a cyclical operating asset, we utilized our partnership with Citigroup, ""Sundance,"" to spread some of the asset risk so that the acquisition would have minimal credit impact.  The credit derivatives package, together with the Sundance partnership, effectively enabled EIM to acquire its physical newsprint supply without bearing the heavy capital costs typically associated with this industry.  


Enron Freight Markets
On June 20, Enron Freight Markets (EFM) closed its first two major origination transactions; one with Werner Enterprises of Omaha, NE and the other with Covenant Transport, Inc of Chattanooga, TN.  Each deal was for the purchase of firm, over the road truckload capacity for a one-year term in the following lanes:

Los Angeles, CA to Oakland, CA
Los Angeles, CA to Chicago, IL
Los Angeles, CA to Columbus, OH
Los Angeles, CA to Newark, NJ
Oakland, CA to Chicago, IL
Chicago, IL to Atlanta, GA
Chicago, IL to Newark, NJ
Atlanta, GA to Newark, NJ

Shipments will commence Monday, July 2 with one truck leaving from each city each weekday.   After a three-week ramp up period, the volume will increase to as many as 3 trucks per city, per day.  

Each of the contracts also contains two options.  The first is Enron's right to extend the term for up to an additional twelve months.  The other is Enron's right to double the aggregate capacity for a period of 30 days up to 1 year.  EFM's Long Term Capacity Agreement represents a new approach to purchasing freight capacity in the transportation industry.  The firmness of the contract is a significant step in moving the industry from typical relationship -based contracts to more commodity-like contracts that allow buyers and sellers to explicitly value risk. 

Cuiaba & the Boliva Brasil Pipeline - Enron wins Award!
The first week in June, the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) presented Enron and Ken Lay an award for the seminal work the company has done with the WCS in Bolivia on conservation activities.  This included work on the Bolivia Brasil Pipeline, the Cuiaba lateral and the efforts concerning the Chiquitano Conservation program.  Congratulations to everyone involved!

IN THE NEWS

A Hand In Everything Enron Gets Rich In California.  But Has It Gouged Consumers?
""Enron has reinvented the energy business, fashioning itself into something closer to a brokerage than a power provider.  Formed in 1985 out of the junk bond merger of two old-line natural gas pipeline companies, Enron pushed relentlessly for deregulation, first in the natural gas business and later in electricity.  From the trading floors of its towering Houston office building, it rivals any Wall Street firm in sophisticated deal making."" -- U.S. News and World Report, June 18

Well, listen to this.  Steve Gullion, EES IT manager, deposited an idea about economic data derivatives.  And guess what?  The Xcelerator liked the idea so much that they are now working on a business plan.  
Go to the Thinkbank (http://nahou-lnapp01.corp.enron.com/eThink/Thinkbank.nsf/HomePage?OpenPage) now and post the idea that has been brewing in your brain!


We've all heard Jeff Skilling say we need to ""earn our way out"" of the current Enron share price slump.  One way we can accomplish this is by doing a better job of managing company expenses.  Ask Kevin Hannon, CEO of Enron Global Asset Services and Policy Committee member, all your questions about how we can earn our way out, together.  Tuesday, June 19 on eSpeak at 10 a.m. Houston time.

Can't make the live event?  No worries.  Go to eSpeak (http://ethink.enron.com/eSpeak/exec/default.asp) now and submit your question.  Kevin will try to answer it during his event and you can read the transcript later.


After Kevin's eSpeak, we'll be opening a category in  eMeet http://nahou-lnapp01.corp.enron.com/eThink/eMeet.nsf called ""Cost Savings Initiatives"" so you can continue talking amongst yourselves and helping Enron save.

To help in clarification of membership, dues, website, etc., I have forwarded these FAQ's:

1. Who is considered a UH alum?
An alum of UH is anyone who has completed at least 6 hours of credits.  One can be enrolled at UH and still be considered an alum as long as 6 hours are completed successfully.

2. What do I have to do to be a member of the Cougars@Enron Alumni Group?
Nothing!  You are already a member of Cougars@Enron if you have completed at least 6 credit hours.

3. Do I have to pay dues to Cougars@Enron to be a member?
No.  You must be an Enron employee AND have completed 6 credit hours.  Cougars@Enron is an extension of the Houston Alumni Organization (HAO).  Therefore, you can pay dues to be an official dues paying member which comes with various benefits.  However, Cougars@Enron Board Members MUST pay dues.

4. Does Enron match dues?
YES!!  You can complete an Enron ""Matching Gift Form"" located on the Community Relations website.  You can have Enron match 100% of your contribution.  For example, a one year membership is $45.  Enron will match the $45 so HAO would receive a total of $90.  Or you can pay $22.50 and have Enron match for a total of $45 and you get the full benefits of a one year member!

5. How do I pay dues?
Just contact me (Tracey Kozadinos x6-7405) and I will inter-office an HAO membership form and ""Matching Gift Form.""  You can then complete both forms and mail to HAO.  Or you can fill out forms at our upcoming events.

6. Does Cougars@Enron have a website?
YES!  Just click http://community.zuniversity.com/z/EnronCougars and then save it as one of your favorites.

Even though Jeff McClellan has left Cougars@Enron, your alumni group is still in action!  My first order of business is to update the Cougar email list.  Since the creation of Cougars@Enron, Enron approximately has hired an additional 400 Cougars.  That brings the Cougar count to 922 alumni!  To date, UH has one of the largest alumni constituencies here at Enron.  Therefore, I am building a new list from scratch to ensure that we have the most up to date list possible.  If you have received this email in error or do not wish to be included on the distribution, please email me and I'll remove your name.  Otherwise, look out for upcoming events such as a Happy Hour and a Cougars@Enron All Alumni Meeting.

I would like to inform you that Cougars@Enron Board of Directors has a few open positions.  If you are interested in serving on the Board, please notify me as soon as possible as our next Board meeting is next week.  It will be on a first come first serve basis.  Requirements include:

1. Must be a dues paying member of the Houston Alumni Organization (Membership forms provided if needed).
2. Must be an Enron Employee
3. Attend Board meetings to be held on the 3rd Wednesday of every month from 11:45-1:00.  Meetings are held in the EB50 Executive Board Room.
4. Lead or participate in one or more of our many committees (Golf Tournament, Tail Gate Parties, Happy Hours, etc).

I will notify you if you have been selected to serve on our Board.  Thank you for your continued interest and I look forward to seeing you soon!

,06/14/2001,,40enron@enron.com,,,Organizational changes,"We are pleased to announce the following organizational changes:

Enron Global Assets and Services

In order to increase senior management focus on our international businesses, we are creating a new business unit, Enron Global Assets and Services (EGAS).  EGAS will be led by Kevin Hannon, Chief Executive Officer, and Jim Hughes, Chief Operating Officer.  Kevin will report to the Enron Corp. Office of the Chairman.  With the exception of the Wessex Water Company (which will remain in the Enron Transportation Services organization) and Enron India (discussed below), EGAS will include all of the assets and activities of the former Enron Global Assets group and the Azurix organization.  EGAS will include Enron's assets and merchant activities in South America.  In order to ensure continuity in the management of our South American merchant business, John Lavorato will remain responsible for those merchant activities.  John will report to Kevin Hannon with respect to the South American merchant business, and will continue to report to the Enron Wholesale Services Office of the Chairman for all other activities in his role as Chief Executive Officer of Enron Americas.

Enron India

Enron's significant interests in India are commanding increased attention from Enron's senior management.  We are pleased to announce that Rebecca McDonald will focus exclusively on Enron's business in India, as Chief Executive Officer of Enron India, reporting to the Enron Corp. Office of the Chairman.

Enron Broadband Services

With Kevin's departure from Enron Broadband Services (EBS), we are also making a number of changes in the EBS organization.  Jim Fallon will now be President and Chief Operating Officer of EBS.  Paul Racicot, Marcello Romano and Fred Cohagan will maintain their EBS risk management activities within their respective regions.  Dave Cox will continue as Chief Commercial Officer of EBS and will also join Ken Rice and Jim Fallon in the EBS Office of the Chairman.  Finally, Rick Fehl will continue as Vice President of Network Engineering and Chief Network Officer but will now report to the EBS Office of the Chairman.


Enron Principal Investments

In order to better develop and manage equity investment opportunities related to Enron's core businesses, we are combining the existing investment groups in ENA, EBS, Enron Investment Partners and the Enron Special Asset Group into a single unit, Enron Principal Investments.  Enron Principal Investments will work with all Enron business units to identify, execute, and manage equity investments that leverage Enron's unique and proprietary knowledge.  These investments may be in the form of venture capital, leveraged buy-outs, traditional private equity and distressed debt positions.  This new business unit will be headed by Kevin Garland, Managing Director, and will report to an investment committee consisting of Dave Delainey, Ken Rice, and Greg Whalley. 

Enron Corporate Development

In order to improve coordination of Enron's corporate development activities, we are consolidating these activities under Andy Fastow, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.  Jeff Donahue, Managing Director of Corporate Development for EBS will now head Corporate Development across Enron.  Corporate Development leaders in the business units will have a dual reporting relationship to their business units and to Jeff.

One of Enron's most compelling challenges is the sale of certain assets or businesses that are no longer core operations.  Mark Metts, Executive Vice President of Enron Corp., will head up a new Special Projects group to specifically focus on the completion of some of these more challenging transactions.  

Please join us in congratulating all of these individuals on their new responsibilities."

,06/12/2001,,40enron@enron.com,,,Business-Wide Cost Saving Opportunities,"At Enron, we're good at a lot of things:  making markets, commoditizing products, managing risk, offering innovative energy solutions to customers - the list goes on and on.  However, one of the things we could do a lot better is watching our expenses.  We're all shareholders in this company, and we need to spend our company's dollars as wisely as we spend our own.

There are some simple, yet significant measures each of us can take to make sure we're careful with Enron's money.  The Policy Committee has approved and recommended the following:

?	Professional Services - This is our largest area of discretionary spending, at more than $600 million last year. ""Professional Services"" includes our contracts with outside law and accounting firms, contractors and other consulting groups.  To make sure that we are negotiating the best rates and terms of service for the company across business units, we are requiring all future professional service contracts and those up for renewal to be negotiated through or in consultation with Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS), effective July 1.  In addition, contracts for more than $5,000 must be pre-approved by the business unit senior executive or their designee and GSS.  For more information, see http://ibuyit.enron.com.

?	On-line expense reporting tool XMS - XMS, our online expense reporting tool, enables us to expedite, monitor and report expenses.  Effective July 1, all employees on domestic U.S. payroll will be required to use XMS for reimbursement of business-related expenses. To access XMS, go to http://xms.enron.com/.  

?	Enterprise wide portal - We currently have 122 internal web sites across the company.  The amount of technology work, marketing collateral, and other related costs required to develop and support so many portals is sizeable.  It makes sense to have one Enron portal so you can efficiently access content and services through a single, personalized channel that will make it easier for you to find information and perform basic tasks online.  This new company-wide portal, under the leadership of Tony Mends, will be launched in several phases beginning this fall.  

Another significant area where we can be more diligent in our spending is travel and entertainment.  Enron has long had travel policies in place.  As we have grown, we have not done as well as we should have in communicating those policies to new employees and reminding all employees to take advantage of the discounts we have negotiated.  The availability of discounts and booking services online should make it easy to save money for the company without sacrificing the comfort of employees who travel.  The following are common sense recommendations that we should all adhere to when traveling for business.  Any regular deviations from these travel policy recommendations will be reviewed by each business unit leader.

?	Air travel - Employees are requested to use either Travel Agency in the Park (TAP) or the GSS-approved preferred travel agency for your location - all of which have access to the significant airfare discounts negotiated by GSS - or http://clicktrip.enron.com/enron, the new online travel booking service that allows employees to book their own travel with the same negotiated discounts.  Employees who fly in the United States should book non-refundable coach tickets, which are typically 65 percent less than refundable tickets and can usually be changed by simply paying a $100 fee.  For this reason, we strongly encourage all employees to purchase non-refundable domestic coach tickets when possible.

?	Lodging - GSS has also negotiated preferred rates at a number of hotel chains in many cities worldwide to accommodate each business unit's individual hotel policy.  We recommend that you use Enron's list of preferred hotels to select accommodations that are in line with your business unit's policies.  You can view the list at http://travel.enron.com.

?	Car rental services - When renting a car for business travel, employees should use our preferred car rental agencies - National (U.S. and Canada) and Alamo (U.S.)- since the agreements we have negotiated are intended to protect you and Enron through the insurance coverage in our contract.  Visit http://travel.enron.com for details and updates to services available outside the U.S.

?	Off-site meetings - All domestic-U.S. off-site meetings and events with more than 10 people should be coordinated through GSS, which will negotiate preferred rates for Enron.  They can be reached at (713) 646-8311.

Because there are differences between business units and offices, each business unit leader will follow up this memo with a communication further elaborating on these policies as they apply to their business unit.

Each of us has a responsibility to make sure we do our part to ensure Enron retains its competitive edge.  These recommendations are some basic, sensible actions we can take company-wide, but it is up to every employee to look for cost saving measures and do what makes sense in your daily activities.  If you have an idea or a suggestion you would like to share with us, please e-mail us at recommendationsforcostsavings@enron.com.   A list of questions and answers about these policies is posted on http://ibuyit.enron.com/gss/ibuyit/csfaq.doc.

,06/12/2001,,40enron@enron.com,,,Houston Flood Relief Effort,"On Saturday, June 9, Tropical Storm Allison left Houston in chaos dumping more than 20 inches of rain and flooding the city in a matter of hours. As of Sunday night, 17 people had died in the storm and many others are still missing. One of those who perished in the fatal flood was one of our employees, a summer intern in ETS and student at Texas A & M University, Chad Garren. Our condolences go out to his family and co-workers. At this time, Enron Community Relations and Aggies@Enron  are planning to establish a scholarship fund in his memory.  More information on the fund will be forthcoming.

Enron has made a corporate contribution of $500,000 to the American Red Cross to aid in the victim relief effort. Enron employees are encouraged to donate to relief efforts and to take advantage of our Matching Gift Program to double the impact of your individual donation.   Enron will match your contribution dollar for dollar and your donation will not be counted against your $15,000 annual limit.

Although Enron is supporting the American Red Cross, please feel free to make your donation to the non-profit organization of your choice that is offering aid to flood victims (they must provide proof of their 501c 3 status). Please send your check to EB1635a before Friday, June 15, and we will send it, along with a matching check to the appropriate agency.  On the memo line of your check, please make sure to write ""Houston Flood Relief.""  

We know that many Enron employees have been severely impacted by this devastating flood. Enron cares about you and your family and would like to make sure that your immediate needs are being met. If you have been displaced because of the flood, please contact the Community Relations hotline at ext. 37181 for assistance. Also, if you would like to help your co-workers who have been displaced, an account has been set up at the Enron Federal Credit Union to accept donations. Please bring/send your contribution to the Enron Federal Credit Union and make your checks out to Employee Flood Relief .

There are many agencies in Houston in need of volunteer assistance. If you would like to volunteer, please e-mail your name and extension to communityrelations@enron.com . Please note if you are willing to lead a project.

Again, our hearts go out to Chad's family and to all of you who have been impacted by this tragedy. Please continue to watch your e-mail for more information."

Just wanted to say ""hi"" today. Hope you can come up some other time this
summer.
 I left you a message on your voice mail.
 I'm sending you some photos of Mikayl and the  Mother's Day flower
arrangement.

 I'm hoping Grandma and Grandpa will be able to come to Dad's retirement
luncheon. Dad's secretary asked for gift ideas and Dad wants no gifts so I
told her the office could chip in for a Harley for him. That went over like
a lead balloon.
 Sandy Fleet is coming next week for 8 days. We are going to have such a
blast!
 Dad is grateful that he doesn't have to attend my 30th class reunion. Sandy
and I will go
. We're shopping in Galena on Sat.
 Did I tell you that we put a wood floor in the dining room? It looks
beautiful! Next, we are planning to add a bottom layer to the deck in the
form of a stone ""floor"".
 Dad may work on it when we're in Savanna but I suspect if the weather is
nice, he will be riding his motorcycle.
 Now if I can emphasize the importance   of a helmet to a safety expert.
(There's a little sarcasm in that footnote.) Sorry.
Have you been shopping for furniture yet?
 Gotta go---my typing is getting atrocious! My typing teacher always liked
me but I know Duane would be cringing now!!
 Love,Mom"

		Merchant Development Risk in Power Generation	
		 	
		A Henwood Multi-client Study	
		 	
		Henwood Energy Services, Inc. (Henwood) offers an opportunity to participate in a cutting edge study of the potential collision of coal and gas and its implications for the electric industry as the battle for the fuel at the margin unfolds.	
		 	
The recent rise in natural gas price over the past year, culminating in a price spike of historic proportions in January 2001 has many industry participants reevaluating the role of natural gas as the ""bridge fuel"" for the twenty-first century. Some observers suspect that low cost gas reserves are tapped out, making reliance on this fuel alone imprudent from an overall portfolio standpoint. 		[IMAGE]	
		 	
		 Currently, there are plans in the works for nearly 40 coal power projects across North America representing 20,000 MW of capacity. Henwood's scenario-based study is designed to cost-effectively enable utilities and project developers assess the regional viability of new, commercially available coal technology using cutting edge screening analysis and their impact on new gas projects.  Participation is limited - sign-up by June 15th to receive the Charter Member price and to participate in the kickoff meeting scheduled for June 20th at the Hyatt Regency Downtown, Houston.

I am helping a friend plan an ""away"" wedding.  I was wondering if you knew of or would suggest any resorts that have full wedding services that we can start looking at.  They want simple wedding and are going to invite their close family and friends, but are not sure who will be able to come yet.  I am thinking it will probably be about 10 people.  They definitely want something tropical and probably all-inclusive would be best.  I had a friend who got married in Playa de Carmen, but I'm not sure which resort.  I was thinking somewhere in Mexico would be good but definitely not Cancun.  They are on a tight budget because they will be paying for it themselves.  So here are the details about what we are looking for:
Tropical All-Inclusive Resort
Round trip airfare
Travel date between November 2001 and January 2002 (what time is cheaper?)
Wedding Services including someone to perform the ceremony, flowers for the bride, photography, location for ceremony (possibly on the beach), location for reception for about 10 people (can be restaurant at the resort)

I couldn't discuss this on the phone because it is my coworkers boyfriend and I who are planning it and she sits right next to me.  If you could give me a list of resorts we will look over them, narrow it down, and then get back to you.  Thank you so much for your help!

I am attaching a revised P&L by Trader.  I moved the Term_GD p&l from Lambie 
to McKay.  We are, however, still off $35,000 on McKay.  It looks like the 
file got updated after we pulled in the final Feb. p&l.  Since we've already 
reported Feb, I can't restate something that would change the total p&l.  An 
adjustment will just need to be made in March to correct the Feb. variance.

manager in another group told one of his analyst to give me his(the

him(the manager).  He wanted me to do it so that he could have them on his 
desk when he gets here at 7:30.  Here's the best part though it takes about 
30 minutes to print all these reports.  So essentially he was asking me to 
come in at 5:00 so that neither he nor his analyst had to come in until 
7:30.  I told the analyst to tell him, ""Not just no, but HELL NO!!  I don't 
work for him, and  I have more important things to do.  If he had any 
questions to give me a call and I'd be glad to explain further.""  Funny, I

,02/07/2001,,robin.rodrigue@enron.com,frank.hayden@enron.com,,Re: INTRA-WEST-PH1,"Frank, 

I don't think the issue is how the books are calced/officialized on those 
days.  Here why.  The same calc is used the day before and for the rest of 
the following month.  The physical calc is simply copied each day.  On Jan. 
31, extending the expert clause to include Feb is the only change made.  Once 
Feb rolles to intramonth the ""From date"" on the calc is changed from the Jan 
1 to Feb 1.  Since January has already rolled off this should have no effect 
on the positions.  Also, the positions for prompt month were correctly 
captured by Risktrac, which leads me to believe that problem is with the VAR 
calc not the post ids.  

Let me know if this doesn't answer your question.

I have attached  a copy of the P&L that was reported as of January 31 for 
Canada.  You will notice that Disturnal's P&L is no longer reported as part 
of Canada, however I have included his p&l  for tieout purposes.  If you have

,01/22/2001,,robin.rodrigue@enron.com,pitre@ev1.net,,,"Hey Becky,

Shannon forwarded me your last email.  I'm so sorry.  I wish there was 
something I could do or say, but I know that I can't really say anything that 
would help.  Just know that I'm thinking about you guys.  I'm glad to hear 
you got to go running.  I'm sure that was a great stress relief.  How's your 
knee doing by the way.  

I'm still spending most of my days answering stupid questions.  Some people 
just drive me nuts.  They come freaking out telling me something's wrong.  
And if they just relax a minute I can usually explain the problem.  Most of 
the time it's not even wrong they just don't understand the reports.  They 
finally announced that we're selling HPL today.  It's about time that that's 
actually going to happen.  

You'll be glad to know that since I had way too much free time lately (I mean 
I been getting at least 4 hours of sleep lately...way more than any one 
person should have) I'm taking a GMAT review course.  We'll see in a couple 
of months if I have any hope of getting into graduate school.   You wanna 
hear the latest breaking news in my career?  If not skip the next couple of 
sentences.  Shannon doesn't even know this yet.  She might have if she'd quit 
blowing off our lunch plans.   I'm going to visit the Chicago office to talk 
to them about me working up there for a year.  I've talked to a manager in 
the office and the VP over the office already and the job sounds really 
interesting.  But I'm going to go up there and see if I think they are lying 
to me.  We'll see how that goes.  I'm not sure what I think about living 
somewhere that cold.  I'm not sure I even have clothes to go for the 
interview, much less to live up there.  

Has Shannon told you about the guy I'm seeing?  She doesn't think he's too 
bright.  He didn't exactly make the best first impression on her.  He really 
is smart no matter what she tells you.  He's a super nice guy, much nicer 
than me (I know, I know that's not saying much).  But the best part is we 
really have a lot of fun together.  We're always laughing and cutting up when 
we're together.  He's from Mexico and we worked together until the end of 
October when he moved to another group.  Then he came home with me for 
Thanksgiving, but we were still just friends then.  It was pretty obvious 
that there was more there though.  We started dating the next weekend.  It's 
been kind of crazy though.  Since we worked together and we had to review 
each other and we didn't want everyone in our business we haven't told anyone 
we work with that we're dating.  So that's been pretty interesting.  No one's 
said anything yet, but I know there are plenty of rumors going around.  It 
really wouldn't bother me if people found out now since reviews are over and 
he and I are comfortable enough with each other that we can take all the 
questions and harrassment from everyone in risk.  

Well my boss has walked by about 10 times and seen me doing nothing but 
sending emails each time, so I probably better get back to work.  I'd love to 
hear from you if you have time.  If not I understand.

What p&l reports did you receive in the past?  We have never changed a p&l 
down here 3 months after the fact,  so I am surprised that would take place 
at all.  I would think that if there were any entry so far in the past that 
it would need to be done by accounting.  I'm not sure what you want done 
about this.  FYI...We have tied out to the dollar with the DPR.

,01/11/2001,,robin.rodrigue@enron.com,kathy.reeves@enron.com,,Re: Canada p&l,"Kathy,

The 2000 DPR is closed.  Therefore no more changes can be made.  As I stated 
in my earlier email, either the 4.1 million adjustment was never actually 
made to the DPR or it is included in our number because the trading and 
origination p&l that I am reporting ties with what the DPR is reporting.

,01/11/2001,,robin.rodrigue@enron.com,gabriel.monroy@enron.com,,Re:,"Here a quick summation of my morning...CANADA SUCKS!!!!  First they 
rearranged their P&L file and moved the order that the traders appear and 
don't bother to tell us, but here's the fun part they didn't rename the 
columns.  So they had McKay's P&L reported in a  column that was titled 
Lambie.  Makes perfect sense right?  Then they call me and tell me that they 
need to move Disturnal's position and VAR under John Arnold, but they want to 
keep his p&l in Canada.  Another fun bit of Canadian ""logic.""

And here my favorite.  I got an email from Kathy this morning in reply to an 
email I sent her on December 8.  She told me that the p&l we reported for the 
first quarter of 2000 was wrong and we need to change our numbers by 4 
million to match was she thinks it should be!!!  She said that they adjusted 
the DPR in the summer to move 4 million from trading to originations.   As if 
that isn't bad enough, consider the fact that I've already explained to her 
at least twice that she's completely high b/c I tie to the DPR for Canadian 
p&l and for the originations total.  

Excluding canada (I've decided they don't deserve to have their country 
capitalized) my day's been good.   I'll have to fill you in on all the EMT 
stories my friend told me.  They were really funny.

$4.1 M was to have been reduced from our Q1 trading income to break out the 
origination correctly.  It looks like this was never done in your report.  I 
thought it had been based on previous Emails.  I don't think the p&l in your 
report is correct as it is $4.1M too high.  This is what our trading income 
at Dec 31 should be.  Note:  the DPR was never adjusted because the LTD and 
YTD numbers do not exclude orgination income.  It also looks like the break 
out by trader is not quite right

I spoke with Robin, and from what we know Canada officializes one calc that 
includes both their price and basis positions.  (Calc is represented by the 
orange)    However, Risktrac only recognizes the book id to which it assigns 
the post id. (It appears that it is only the PRC book that comes through, the 
BAS book is represented by the red ""x"", however it is in the same calc.).  
Since the Canadian post id only includes two books ids,  the Benchmark group 
manually assign the same post id to the basis book, that way both books get 
picked up.

Does this help?

Shannon and she filled me in on how Megan's doing.  I want you to know my

there is anything I can do I'd love to help out.  I'm going Christmas 
shopping this weekend if you need me to pick up anything for you.  I've got 
to finish all my shopping and buy something for my mom from my dad.  He had a 
hip replacement in October and is still hobbling around.  He's actually doing 
really well considering he had major surgery.   I think he expected to be 
running marathons by now.  

I'd love to tell you at lot of interesting things going on in my life right 
now, but unfortunately my life can be summed up in one word right 
now...WORK.  I think my other group members are trying to kill me this 
month.  We have a group of three people and at least two have to be here each 
day.  Well, I have to work a double shift to cover for someone all but one 
week this month.  So that's pretty much all I have time to do now.  In fact 
I'm headed home pretty soon to take a nap before my next shift this 
afternoon.  That is the one bonus of this split shift day.

,12/08/2000,,robin.rodrigue@enron.com,kathy.reeves@enron.com,,Re: Canada p&l,"Kathy,

I am attaching a copy of the NGPL that was reported as of this morning.  If 
you look at the by Trader P&L, we are off from your spreadsheet by 
approximately $3.6 million USD for December and approximately $7.6million 
year to date.  The $7.6 consists of the December variance and the $4 million 
variance that we discussed earlier (originations).  However, I spoke with the 
Chris Able from the Controls group, what we are reporting for originations 
and for Canadian p&l ties to the DPR.   This leads me to believe that either 
our number already includes the origination adjustment or the origination 
adjustment was never made to the DPR.  To help resolve the December variance, 
I have added a tab to your file to show what we have reported each day for 
December.  

Remember the p&l we are reporting by trader excludes originations.  Give me a 
call when you have time and we can try to resolve these variances.


 

Thanks,
Robin

email...thumbs in ears, remaining fingers covering eyes, and repetitive 
chanting of la,la,la,la,la,la........  

I'm so disappointed but I won't be able to join you for the ""fun run"" on 
Thanksgiving.  I'm headed home to see the family.   I really wish you were 
here right now.  You are one of the few people that would truly appreciate 
how irritating this guy that sits next to me is!!!  He just asked someone how 
Chi-COG-OOOO was.  How do you accent every syllable (and then really drag out 
the last)???  Unfortunately that isn't nearly the most irritating thing that 
he does.  I'll update you as he provides me with more stories.

As for the food in Australia...it's really not all that different from here.  
I mean Sydney is a big city so they have just about every type of food.  They 
have a lot of American fast food chains.  The one that surprised me though 
was KFC...it's everywhere.  It's a lot more popular there than it is here.  I 
guess some of the biggest differences are that they eat pumpkin as a 
vegetable, and they put beets on their hamburgers, and they eat a lot of 
lamb.  Lamb is about as cheap and common as chicken is here.  And they eat 
meat pies....yuck.  The pastry is good on the pies but there's no flavor to 
the meat...it's just greasy ground beef.  I think they still have a little 
too much of a British influence in their food...they don't believe in 
seasoning.  

I saw quite a few good looking guys.  There was a lifesaver training course 
going on at Bondi while I was there.  That provided some great scenery!!  But 
then the problem is that the men don't realize when to stop wearing the 
speedos!!  The young guys look good in them, but after 30 they shouldn't be 
worn in public...and after 60 they shouldn't even be considered as underwear 
under six layers of clothing, but they especially shouldn't be worn on the 
beach!!!!  I saw one old man whose belly hung so low that I wasn't even sure 
he had a suit on, and I was scared to look too close for fear of what I might 
see and for fear he'd think I was interested.

Gotta go to a meeting.

What's going on?  Things are completely crazy as usual around here.  I need 
another vacation!  I never told you about my trip did I?  I've told everyone 
else that stood still for more than 10 seconds.  It was so much fun.  The 
olympics were so awesome.  I got to see the US women's basketball team play 
Australia for the gold medal.  The crowd was soooo wild...that is until we 
won.  And I got to see Cathy Freeman and Marion Jones run.  The whole first 
week of my trip was spent at the olympics everyday.  And the second week I 
spent touring all the beaches that I could find.  Oh, here's a funny story 
for you.  Okay I'm halfway across the world in a country known for bronze, 
muscular sufers, right?  So I take a day cruise around the Brisbane waters 
one day.  These cruises are scheduled everyday and each ship holds about 
80-100 people.  As we board the captain tells us that there will be 85 people 
on the cruise.  Here's the fun part....80 of the 85 people were from a WWII 
veterans reunion!!!  I was on a boat full of grandpa's.  Actually it was 
pretty funny.  This one old man sat next to me and started telling me why 
they were having the reunion and what thier batallion had done during the 
war.  Then he tells me (keep in mind this man's at least 70) that he was a 
lifesaver (lifeguard) on one of the local beaches until the year before when 
an injury forced him to retire!!!   Then he starts telling me about the war.  
He said, ""Yeah, I was a POW for about 9 days but they weren't feeding me very 
well so I left.""  He had escaped from a Nazi POW camp and fled to Greece 
where he joined the Greek reserve forces.  Because he fought with Greece in 
the war he's now a Greek citizen.  Then after the war he and some friends 
bought a van and traveled all over Europe and Asia.  When they ran out of 
money they'd just stop and get jobs until they could save some money and then 
they'd start again.  I hope one day I have stories even half that 
interesting!!  But leave it to me to go halfway around the world and hang out 
with old people!!  

How's everything going at your house?  What's up with this election?  That's 
all anyone's talking about around here.

Due to a forecast for mild November weather, futures prices have fallen 
sharply over the last five days.   Nymex futures prices have fallen a total 
of $0.68 over the last five days.  The Gas desk's loss is primarily driven by 
a long price position held by the Financial desk, which averaged 7, 295

Doesn't it suck to be at work and know that someone else is out of the 
country?  I just want to let you know how much I suffered while you were 
gone.  I realize now just how bad you must want out of this group.  Without 
you or Jennifer there was no real conversation the whole week!!  Chris just 
works quietly.  Jason interrupts the quiet with inane comments that I have no 
idea how to respond to.  And Anne...well I can't even explain that.  

Let me digress for just a moment to talk about work.  Nothing really 
happened.  All was quiet.   If anyone was upset about anything they didn't 
tell me about it.   I did get an email from Frank Cernseck(or how ever you 
spell his name).  It seems we took too much as broker fees in July.  I 
haven't researched it, but from what Victor tells me that's an adjustment 
that needs to be made on last day P&L.  I'm sure I'm not telling you anything 
you don't know.   

Just wanted to let you know I'm glad you're here and I'm not.

engineer and one's an accountant.  One works for a natural gas company and 
the other works for an accounting firm.  Which one works for the accounting 
firm?  

Do you see the absurdity of our lives???  Level III, huh?  I don't know 
anyone over level II.  Well, except Mr. Kirkpatrick's friend that's a partner 
in New Orleans.  

I dreamed the other night that I was outside the Swimming venue in Australia 
and the American coach heard me talking and realized I was an American.  He 
told me I had to swim an event b/c all the swimmers were either sick or 
injured.  I never did get to swim, though.  The alarm went off before I even 
found out what event I was swimming.  I hope it's not butterfly...I wouldn't 
be very competitive if I had to swim butterfly.  Not that I'd even be 
competitive if I was swimming freestyle at the olympics, unless it was the 
special olympics...then I might stand a chance!

Congrats on the job.

I'm not sure if Binh sent an email to you and to Controls to explain the 
Canadian origination variance.  You may already be aware, but on the Orig 
Sched the originations are converted to $US using the spot rate for the day.  
However when the originations are calculated for the Report tab the rate 
applied is the average rate for the month.  Therefore these values will never 
be the same.  Nicole is going to talk to Kathy when she gets back to Canada 
on Monday.  Nicole says she has found a way to modify their spreadsheet so 
that both values are calculated using the daily spot rate.   If you haven't 
recieved an email from Binh explaining this issue you might want to forward 
the attached message from Nicole to Michael and Chris.

of scary!!  Just in case you think I made this stuff up the web site's at the 
bottom.  

The U.S. Department of Agriculture is actively proposing that animal 
carcasses with cancers,
     tumors or open sores be regarded merely as unaesthetic but safe for 
human consumption as
        long as the offending part is cut away. The proposal is part of a 
general loosening of
     slaughterhouse inspection standards, whose public comment period ends 
Aug. 29. One critic
    already weighed in, saying she did not want to ""eat pus from a chicken 
that has pneumonia,"" but
    also included as benign by the proposal are glandular swellings, 
infectious arthritis and diseases
                             caused by intestinal worms.



                               In Their Own Words

     Hubert Penrod Jr., on why the May promotion he had scheduled for his 
Huge Hooter Haven
     strip club in Nashville had failed to attract men who had come to town 
for the Billy Graham
    Crusade that weekend: ""I know all the porn stars, but I don't exactly 
keep up with preachers.
     Hell, I thought Billy Graham was some singer or something. It never 
entered my mind that (it
                was) some preacher (who) was filling up the football stadium.""

   cigars, insured them against fire, among other hazards. Within a month,
   having smoked his entire stockpile of cigars and without having made
   even
   his first premium payment on the policy, the man filed a claim against
   the
   insurance company. In his claim, the man stated that the cigars were
   lost
   ""in a series of small fires"".
   The insurance company refused to pay, citing the obvious reason: that
   the
   man had consumed the cigars in the normal fashion. The man sued ... and
   won! The ruling judge agreed that the claim was frivolous. He stated,
   nevertheless, that the man held a valid policy from the company in which

   it had warranted that the cigars were insurable and also guaranteed that

   it would insure against fire, without further defining what would be
   considered to be an ""unacceptable fire,"" and was obligated to pay the
   claim. Rather than endure a lengthy and costly appeal process, the
   insurance company accepted the ruling and paid the man $15,000 for the
   rare cigars he had lost in the ""fires"".
   And now the good part...After the man cashed the check, the insurance
   company had him arrested on 24 counts of arson. With his own insurance
   claim and testimony from the previous case being used against him, the
   man was convicted of intentionally burning his insured property and
   sentenced to 24 months in jail and a $24,000.00 fine."

Just a couple of things.  First the risk type on the spreadsheets needs to be 
the same as on the files I sent to you.  Second, I am attaching a copy of the 
positions that I queried out of GRMS after I loaded your text files.  The 
positions aren't even close to the IM Positions file you save out to our 
directory.  I have also included the detail that supports the GRMS position.  
Our goal with the text files is to eliminate the need for plugging your 
positions and to ensure that your correct position is included in the VAR 
calculation.  Let me know if there is anything I can do to help you resolve 
this variance.

The Power Book shows a MTD origination variance of $17.5.  This is shown on 
the origination file(Power Tab) and will be picked up on the NGP&L today.  
However it is still not being added into the MTD tab because the book 
administrator added the originator's name to the same cell as the origination 
category.  It is just a concatenate problem, but I don't have access to that 
file.  If you or Michael could fix that I would appreciate it.

When the Power p&l was added to this book last week the formulas did not

Lavorato was given a corrected report, so this variance will not be included

,06/26/2000,,robin.rodrigue@enron.com,david.baumbach@enron.com,rahmaan.mwongozi@enron.com,Benchmark Process,"David,

Here is a short list of what it takes to pull positions into the benchmark.  

1)  Once a book is officialized it must be loaded into GRMS BEFORE the 
positions can be pulled into the benchmark.  

2) With everyone officializing books around the same time the GRMS que is 
overloaded and positions are very slow to be loaded into GRMS.  

3)  GRMS processes books in the order that they are officialized.  If one of 
your books is officialized behind either the Nymex, Power, or Canadian books 
your book will not  be loaded into GRMS until these books are finished.  This 
process can take up to 45 minutes to complete.  

4)  I have to manually create text files for deals that they system is not 
designed to handle.  These files must then be loaded into GRMS.

4)  I have to manually override Post-IDs that for one reason or another do 
not come in automatically or that come in incorrectly.  

5)  The benchmark query takes approximately 15 minutes to complete.  The more 
books that are officialized, the longer the query takes.  

6)  When books are unofficialized and reofficialized, this effectively sends 
that book to the back of the GRMS que.  This means that the entire process 
must be started over.

7)  Now that plugging positions is no longer an option, I have to spend time 
researching any variances that arise between the GRMS position and the ERMS 
position.

8)  If the book admin and I cannot solve the problem, then I have to contact 
the GRMS support team.  Since this usually occurs after their regular hours 
it takes a while before they can get back in touch with me.  

9)  I cannot query new data while I'm researching variances or on the phone 
with GRMS support because I need access to  the information that is currently 
in the bench.  

10)  Finally, this is a massive file therefore we frequently get errors and 
have to shut down.  Even if the spreadsheet has been saved and no data is 
lost it still take about 10 minutes just to shut this file down and reopen 
it. 

If you have any more questions let me know.

I took a look at the detail but it is very difficult to use because if does 
not tie into the summary page at all.  I did note the following things though:
You are not pulling in our CGPR-Aeco/Basis Positions into the summary (a 
quick look at Aug/Sept/of Oct will show this)
July will NEVER tie out until systems is able to roll off 1/30th of the MI

Thanks for the information.  Will I receive the $3,500 automatically on my

turn it in to?

,06/09/2000,,robin.rodrigue@enron.com,jeffrey.gossett@enron.com,,Re: Accomplishments,"1.  I have learned how to prepare the NGP&L.

2.  I have gained an understanding of the originations process in order to 
properly represent originations on the NGP&L.

3.  I have learned how to prepare the Benchmark.

4.  I have reduced the time spent at night running the Basis reports by 
consolidating the Shankman, Fletch, and Lavorato reports into one file so 
that the information                need only be queried once.  This was 
accomplished by creating multiple Date Bucket designations in a single file.  

5.  I updated the Greg Pos. Report, so that it ties to the Benchmark in total 
and reflects the Lavorato time buckets.

6.  I updated the Gas Detail Tab of the Benchmark to include new books that 
have been added to the Benchmark.  This enabled me to tie the Greg Pos Report 
to the Benchmark.

7.  I created an additional section of the Gas Detail Tab to calculate the 
fixed price positions.  This section is used to report the total fixed price 
position by seasonal buckets on the Lavorato Basis report.  

I have not included any accomplishments from my former group.  If you would 
like to see them also please let me know.

Just wanted to send you a summary of the Nov SWAPS I sold for you last night.  

Sold 10,000 @ 2.45

Sold 70,000 @ 2.44

for a total of 95,000 sold.

The bid stayed between 2.43 and 2.425 the rest of the night so I didn't sell the last 5,000.

As mentioned in the previous communication, this was the first of several communications to be sent by the Enron Global Technology group and we will continue to provide more details in the coming weeks regarding this significant but necessary change to our Email environment.
 
We are working toward a cut-off date of January 14, 2002, at which time we will no longer support Email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname.lastname@enron.com (or firstname.middleinitial.lastname@enron.com if your name in Lotus Notes or Outlook has a middle initial in it). We understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard Email address format, but it is important to begin making the change now.
 
If you have questions, please send an Email to Enron.Messaging.Administration@enron.com.
 
Thank you for your support.

Customer migration - they price as a Put
Load following - they know its a short straddle position, but they have no tools to value so they base the price on historicals
Hedging - they always look to hedge out the position with standard block purchases
Ancillaries - they do no analysis, and simply add margin to the transaction
Adjustment clause - they have been adding fuel adjustment clauses to the deals that allow them to be cheaper up front
Booking - they have 2 books, spec trading and structured trading, the originator maintains P&L exposure on the transaction and works with the trader to assess how to manage/hedge the positions"

We will be meeting with Calpine next Tuesday to discuss the size of the transaction and determine the positions and regions that best suit Enron & Calpine.  We will continue to push for PJM-E and Nepool components based on our earlier discussions, but I suspect FRCC volumes will end up being much less than listed in the term sheet below.  

Dana, currently EES has subscribed for the 50mw RTC energy listed in the term sheet below.  I will follow up with you today to see if you have any interest in expanding our Nepool subscription.

Here at Enron, the mail center and Business Controls/Corporate Security have already implemented safeguards so that all mail entering the Enron buildings will be screened in accordance with procedures for identifying suspicious packages.  We are also in touch with the U.S. Postal Service and the Centers for Disease Control to ensure we have the most complete and up-to-date guidance for handling any possible Anthrax exposures.

However, should you receive an envelope or package that you do not feel comfortable opening, please contact Corporate Security at extension 3-6200 and we will screen it again.

To provide Enron employees with a better understanding of  Anthrax and the potential danger it poses, we have posted a bulletin on the Corporate Security intranet site http://home.enron.com:84/security/002_bull_001.html that includes links to the CDC and USPS resources."

,10/16/2001,,no.address@enron.com,,,Third Quarter Earnings Results,"Today, we announced our third quarter earnings results, which were right on target with analysts estimates for recurring earnings per diluted share of $0.43.  This marks a 26 percent increase over the third quarter of last year, which is due to the strong performance of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural gas pipelines.  In addition, we also announced that we are on track for our earnings target of $0.45 for the fourth quarter ($1.80 for 2001) and $2.15 for 2002.

We made a commitment to you that we would provide you with timely information about Enron's business strategy and performance, so this email is intended to provide an explanation about our earnings this quarter.

Over the past few months, we have met with analysts to discuss Enron's performance.  We received considerable feedback from investors and analysts that we needed to expand our financial reporting to include details for more of our business units.  In response to that feedback, we have provided results separately for several of our business units.  For example, while we have provided volume figures for North America and Europe, this is the first quarter we have provided financials separately for Enron Americas and for Europe and Other Commodities.  In addition, information about our global assets had previously been included in our numbers for Wholesale Services.  This quarter they are reported separately.   Finally, even though our broadband business is now part of Enron Wholesale Services, we are continuing to report that business separately.

Following are the highlights of our businesses:

Wholesale Services: Total income before interest, minority interests and taxes (IBIT) increased 28% to $754 million in the third quarter.  Total wholesale physical volumes increased 65% to 88.2 trillion British thermal units equivalent per day (Tbtue/d).
Americas: IBIT increased 31% to $701 million.  Natural gas volumes increased 6% to 26.7 Tbtu/d, and power volumes increased 77% to 290 million megawatt hours (MWh).
Europe and Other Commodity Markets: IBIT remained unchanged at $53 million as compared to last year.  While physical gas and power volumes increased, low volatility in these markets caused profitability to remain flat.

Retail Services: Enron Energy Services reported IBIT of $71 million, compared to $27 million a year ago.  So far this year, EES has completed more than 50 transactions with large customers and more than 95,000 deals with small business customers.


Transportation and Distribution:
	Natural Gas Pipelines: IBIT increased slightly to $85 million in the third quarter.
Portland General: We reported an IBIT loss of $(17) million this quarter compared to IBIT of $74 million a year ago.  This loss is due to power contracts PGE entered into at prices that were significantly higher than actual settled prices during the third quarter.  Last week, we  announced an agreement to sell PGE to Northwest Natural.  This transaction is expected to close next year.
Global Assets: This segment includes Elektro, Dabhol, TGS, Azurix and Enron Wind.  Third quarter IBIT remained unchanged at $19 million compared to last year.

Broadband Services: IBIT losses were $(80) million in the current quarter compared to a $(20) million loss last year.  This quarter's results include significantly lower investment-related income and lower operating costs.

Corporate and other: This segment includes the unallocated expenses associated with general corporate functions. This segment reported an IBIT loss of $(59) million compared to $(106) million a year ago.

In addition, this quarter we announced one-time charges of $1.01 billion.  Over the past few quarters, we have conducted a thorough  review of our businesses and have decided to take certain charges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential  of our core businesses.  These charges include:
?	A $287 million write-down of Azurix Corp.
?	$183 million associated with the restructuring of Broadband Services.  This includes severance costs, a loss on the sale of inventory like servers and routers, and a write-down of the value of our content services contracts due to the bankruptcy of a number of customers.
?	$544 million related to losses from certain investments, primarily Enron's interest in The New Power Company, broadband and technology investments and early termination of a structured finance arrangement.  

With our announcements this quarter we accomplished three things:  1) we showed continued strong earnings and earnings growth in our core businesses, 2) we cleared away those things that were clouding this superb performance in our core businesses, and 3) We expanded our reporting of financial results to increase transparency for our investors.

Many of you responded, and I want to share the survey results with you.  Additionally, I want to share with you the things we are currently doing or plan to do to move Enron forward.

First, let's take a look at the survey results.

In just three days, more than 4,000 employees completed the survey.  I sincerely appreciate your participation.

I.  We asked you to identify the top five issues facing Enron today.  The responses were:

1.	Stock price
2.	The PRC
3.	Employee/internal morale
4.	External reputation and image
5.	""Walking the talk"" of integrity and respect"

The survey was comprehensive, including Fortune 100 companies and two big-5 accounting firms.  The results of the survey have highlighted that some of our salaries are below today's market. So ... we set out to fix that. 
We spent a significant amount of time looking at individual salaries benchmarked against the survey results of positions with similar responsibilities and experience levels.  Existing internal equity issues were also considered.
Early next week, we will contact everyone to discuss where your current salary falls in our new ranges. If your salary is going to be adjusted, we will communicate your new salary at that meeting. We will also give you your new Enron Wholesale Services - Financial Operations shirt ( yes.. we have changed our name back to Financial Operations). All salary adjustments will be effective September 1st. 
I know that this has been a busy and challenging year for everyone and is likely to remain that way for awhile. We have made tremendous progress toward our major goals this year of cleaning up our accounts, understanding our balance sheet, getting our arms around our cash flow, dealing with tremendous volume growth in trading and building timely and value-added management reporting products. I recognize and appreciate all of your efforts."

Hope your are doing well in all this rainy weather.  I wanted to ask you a question and your opinion of the odds of me being placed if I go into the redeployment program?  I got my review back and it is much better than it has been in a long time.  I guess I am just concerned that if I don't make a move now, year end might not be as favorable for me.  Rumor has it that the other clerk that I work with has found another job and will be leaving on the 14th of Sept.  I have been caught in such a vicious cycle so long that I just don't know what else to do.  If you have time call me or email me.  I just want to know what you think.

As noted by IPPNY, the impact of this court ruling could be to delay the environmental review and thus the permitting time for these smaller plants.  In other generation-related developments, the NYS Siting Board last week approved the Astoria Energy project. This is a 1,000 MW natural gas-fired combined-cycle facility to be loacted in Astoria, Queens, New York City. The plant is estimated to go in service the 3rd quarter of 2004. This brings to over 1600 MW the amount of new in-city generation recently approved by the State Siting Board, on top of the 400 Mw\W added this past summer by the NY Power Authority.

and a depressed stock price, Enron Corp. would logically be prime takeover
bait. But in the topsy-turvy world of Enron, what constitutes logic
anymore?

Takeover speculation has swirled around Wall Street and the energy markets
in recent days as Enron shares have plummeted by about two-thirds to their
lowest level in a decade, a selloff sparked by a loss of investor
confidence in the Houston energy-trading company following big
third-quarter write-downs and the disclosure of a Securities and Exchange
Commission inquiry into transactions involving its former chief financial
officer. Among the names bandied about as potential buyers of all or at
least a substantial chunk of Enron are General Electric's GE Capital unit,
Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway and Royal Dutch/Shell. GE and Berkshire
had no comment. A spokesman for Shell couldn't be reached.

Meanwhile, Enron has approached at least one major institutional investor,
seeking a capital infusion, according to a person familiar with the matter.
But Enron was turned down because of uncertainties over its financial
condition, this person says.

While Enron shares, which are trading at about book value, look cheap by
historical standards and even compared with two weeks ago, it isn't clear
whether history is much guide when evaluating Enron these days, say
analysts and others. Even fans of the stock have long complained about
difficulty understanding how Enron operates because of its enormously
complex financial structure and relatively sparse disclosure. For years
while Enron's stock price was soaring, much of Wall Street didn't seem to
care about such issues.

Moody's Downgrades Enron's Debt, Maintains Review; Stock Drops 10% (Oct.
30)

Enron Is in Discussions With Banks for Credit Line of up to $2 Billion
(Oct. 29)

Enron Taps $3 Billion From Bank Lines in Pre-Emptive Move to Ensure
Liquidity (Oct. 26)

Enron Replaces Fastow as Finance Chief; Move Follows Concerns Over
Partnerships (Oct. 25)

Now with Enron's stock dropping, that lack of understanding is haunting the
company. ""How bad could Enron get? That's really the question,"" says
Prudential Securities analyst Carole Coale. Tuesday, Ms. Coale reduced her
price target for Enron shares to $9 and maintained the ""sell""
recommendation she recently put on the stock. At 4 p.m. Tuesday in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading, Enron shares were down $2.65, or 19%, to
$11.16, down from nearly $85 a year ago.

""When a business like this starts a down cycle, they've got to stop it and
stabilize before anyone will be willing to have a really intelligent
conversation with them,"" says Peter J. Solomon, head of Peter J. Solomon
Co., an investment-banking boutique.

An Enron spokesman says the company won't comment on takeover speculation;
nor will it comment on whether it had approached potential investors about
a possible capital infusion. However, the continued plunge in Enron shares
and turmoil surrounding the company are a significant ""overreaction in the
marketplace. Our core businesses are strong,"" he says. The company has said
that it is taking steps to restore investor confidence.

For example, Enron is trying to negotiate a new credit line with its major
banks. Late Tuesday, Enron's bankers were putting the final touches on a
new credit line of more than $1 billion, according to people familiar with
the discussions.

Analysts and other observers say that one uncertainty surrounding Enron is
the condition of its vast energy-trading operation. As the nation's biggest
energy trader, Enron is a principal in one-quarter of all electricity and
natural-gas trades. Enron's EnronOnline Internet-based trading platform has
transacted more than $884 billion of trades since it was created in
November 1999 and does about $4 billion a day in transactions.

One worry is that Enron's trading partners, edgy about the turmoil swirling
around the company, will start demanding much tougher credit terms from the
Houston company or simply cut back doing business. Such a trend, if it
picked up enough momentum, could have troubling consequences for Enron. ""We
are all in suspense. ... It all depends on how the market reacts,"" says
Susan Abbott, a managing director at Moody's Investors Service. On Monday,
Moody's downgraded Enron's long-term debt.


There were some warning signs of unease among trading partners even before
the company's third-quarter earnings release set the stage for the huge
drop in the stock price. About six to seven weeks ago, Entergy Corp. became
worried about its level of exposure in Enron-related deals, says Wayne
Leonard, chairman and chief executive officer of the big New Orleans energy
company. Since then, Entergy has cut its Enron exposure to about $10
million to $20 million from $90 million to $100 million, he says. Mr.
Leonard didn't specify what prompted the worries, which appear to have
arisen after the surprise August announcement by Jeffrey Skilling that he
was resigning as Enron president and chief executive. Mr. Skilling cited
personal reasons as well as his concerns over the falling stock price.

While the Enron spokesman says the company doesn't comment on specific
trading arrangements, he adds that Entergy is one of his company's smaller
trading partners. He says major trading partners are doing business with
Enron on ""essentially the same terms and conditions"" and that overall ""our
trading operations are as strong as ever.""

The company spokesman adds that a few smaller trading partners in Europe
are seeking revised credit terms from Enron. ""We are working to put
together credit terms, which they are more comfortable with,"" says the
spokesman, who declines to be more specific.

In an effort to bolster its liquidity and position in the marketplace,
Enron last week drew down some $3 billion, accounting for the bulk of its
existing credit lines. While it used most of that money to buy its
outstanding commercial paper, a short-term corporate IOU, the company
retained about $1 billion of the borrowings as cash.

A friendly takeover of all or part of Enron would be likelier than a
hostile one. Among the most obvious candidates would be other companies
with big trading operations and experience in risk management. Two possible
deterrents to a would-be buyer: a flurry of recent shareholder lawsuits
filed against Enron and the continuing SEC probe

However, the question is what our business looks like going forward given the circumstances facing Enron in the coming weeks and months.  I'm not sure how it is all going to play out.  I know there will be opportunities but how I'm going to go about filling those and what limits are placed on our business hasn't been made clear yet.  I'll be glad to take some time to sit down and talk about this with you and give you any direction I have.  You are welcome to call my secretary, Tamara Black, and get on my calendar.

This notice is being sent to all trained fire wardens I have listed at Enron Center North.  As you may know, each year the Houston Fire Department reviews every high rise building to make sure they are in compliance with the Houston city fire code.  As part of that process, it is required by law that Enron maintain accurate records of all trained fire wardens as well as keep an ongoing list of any persons with a mobility impairment who may require special assistance during a fire drill or evacuation.  A fire drill will occur at Enron on or before December 1st.  Therefore, as trained fire wardens on your respective floors, if you know of anyone who may require special assistance during an actual fire drill or building evacuation, please forward there names to me so that I may obtain their contact information to maintain on file.  The Houston Fire Department is subject to fine Enron between $250 and $2000 for every daily violation that occurs if these records are not kept up to date.  Note, this information is strictly for use to have on file for the Houston Fire Department.  It will be kept confidential.  Thank you in advance for your assistance.

In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.

Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows: 

1.	Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.    
2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 
3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.
  
This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.
  
If you have questions regarding commercial aspects of this agreement, please feel free to contact Tom Moore, GSS senior contract manager at 713-345-5552.  For technical issues, please contact Hasan Imam, ENW IT manager at 713-345-8525."

In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

If you do not currently have a photo on your badge, please go to the badge office on the third floor of the Enron Building and have your photo added to your badge.  We also suggest allowing a bit more time in getting to the Hyatt and we request your patience, as these security measures may create some backup at the entrance to the ballroom.

participation of EPSA staff and members at NERC.

A roster of participants follows this brief summary.

Most members agreed in concept that NERC must continue to be monitored at 
least in the near term because of their ""monopoly"" on the 
reliability/commercial rules.  There was agreement that NERC had moved into 
the commercial/non-reliability standards setting partly becuase the 
incumbants desgined it that way and partly due to a lack of another industry 
representative forum  for FERC to delegate to.  Some members were encouraged 
that GISB was interested in becoming an alternative forum (EISB) and pointed 
to GISB successes in creating an efficient Bulletin Board for Gas in response 
to FERC orders.  The members also realized that most of the NERC problems are 
caused by the native load exception which the gas industry did not have to 
deal with making their restructuring easier.

EPSA staff will focus on representing EPSA members' viewpoints to the 
independent board members to establish working relationships and to provide 
market perspectives as well as governance problems within the NERC 
structure.  

Many EPSA members also felt that EPSA staff could do more to provide 
information regarding NERC issues that affect the markets so that a greater 
number of members can convey their positions to the NERC Committee and 
Subcommittee market representatives. Some possible email/members only 
bulletin board was discussed.

Reliant (John Orr) also expressed concern over continuing to allow NERC (as 
opposed to the RTOs)  to set the commercial standards.  Most agreed that NERC 
does not design efficient commercial/market standards and should leave the 
non-reliablity rules to RTOs.  Others (myself, DENA, Ontario Power Gen) who 
participate on NERC groups agreed to this in concept but raised the problem 
that many of the reliability rules overlap commercial rules with no ""bright 
line"" between the two.

RE: NERC Statements on Impact of Security Threats on RTOs

The attached e-mail in Microsoft Word form contains statements that NERC made during a recent meeting with members of the national press.  The statements concern NERC's view of the implications of terrorist threats for FERC's "" Four RTO policy"" set forth in its July 12th Order.  The statements also may bear upon the effort to establish a new standards setting organization, particularly the possibility that NERC's responsibilities could be shifted to EISB.  Also attached is an article containing the views of R.J. Rudden Associates, Inc. that discusses the risks associated with centralizing control center operations.

Specifically, NERC representatives informed the press that on September 11 ""the grid was the target of an insidious cyber attack that shut down some facilities...from an information administration standpoint.""  They noted that this resulted in service denials, although it is not clear whether they indicated where or how much.  This event was attributed to the so-called ""NIMBA virus"".

NERC's statements suggest a new strategy to preserve the role they've played not only in security matters, but possibly other aspects pertaining to ""reliability standards.""  They warn against any immediate transition to fewer RTOs as envisioned in FERC's July 12th Order.  Moreover, it is likely that NERC will argue that, given its expertise and experience, recent events make transitioning to a new standards organization (EISB?) ill advised.  

It is unclear what, if any, impact all this may have on RTO development, the legislative effort to establish a new reliability standards body or the NERC Board's consideration of pending reform proposals at its October meeting.  However, we can expect security related issues to be included in future discussions of these matters. 

Please provide your reactions to the NERC statements to Mark Bennett at 202-628-8200 or mbennett@epsa.org"
,09/27/2001,,charles.yeung@enron.com,"d..steffes@enron.com, richard.shapiro@enron.com, shelk@enron.com","carin.nersesian@enron.com, linda.robertson@enron.com, sarah.novosel@enron.com",RE: EPSA/EEI on Reliability,"EISB will go forward irregardless of the electric quadrant getting formed.  But the real issue of course is forming this quadrant. 

The EISB  new By-Laws will be publicly available in a couple/few weeks.  It will be able to accomodate ANY type of organization for each of it quadrants.  If the Wholesale Electric Quadrant (WEQ) wants to include both reliability and commercial standards, it may.  If the WEQ wants only to address commerical it may...and every permutation of the two.  So, EISB is flexible enough.  One possibility that has been proposed (and I believe it comes from the NERC staff) is that NERC could be ""reliability only"" and operate with a Memorandum of Understanding with the EISB WEQ that would be focused on commercial issues.  Not a winner for us - but just to show you how flexible the EISB charter will be.

I will get you more comments on details of EEI language later."

 I  completely agree with Dave .In addition to the levels of redundancy he states  it is important to note that the Central Control Centers are more of a communication and dispatch hub but the actual control of  the circuit breakers , transformers, phase angle regulators and  voltage control devices(the reliability backbone) resides within the ""sub control centers "" of the Transmission Operators like Con Edison, Florida Power &Light  etc etc..The destruction of one of the major RTO control centers will not shut down transmission lines or trip generators off line .There would be loss of communication to the region or local control centers and there may be some out of merit generation moves but it would not be a disaster . With the  redundancy of control centers, computers ,communications and data acquisition along with the proper protocols and procedures the loss should  not severely effect the security or reliability of the transmission grid .This redundancy will be an important part of the RTO development but there is no valid reason to slow up the present pace of progress because of this issue.

I believe there are much more vulnerable areas within the Transmission grid that NERC should be concerned about and address . I am open to continue this discussion off line .   Dan"

The NERC statements clearly seem to indicate they feel threatened by the RTO formation process and EISB.

Frankly, nothing stated anywhere in the attachments hasn't already been thought out and handled by the three ISOs in the East and the CAISO as well.  All four of these entities have fully functional back-up facilities in other parts of their regions and NERC is fully aware of them.  I would assume ERCOT also has a fully functional, redundant control scheme in place as well.

In the case of NY there is another site physically apart from the main control center which has a fully redundant computer and communications system.  They have (or used to have) plans which in the event neither center is available, can revert control back to the TOs (heaven forbid)  until ISO personnel can resume control of the grid.  So they have 3 sets of redundancy, in addition to radio and satellite communications if necessary.

Earlier RTO West discussions all contained similar concerns and plans for redundancy and the DSTAR preliminary design documents also plan on redundancy.  NERCs assertion that they would ""slow-down"" the RTO formation process is absurd (geez, it's going too slow now!!!). 

Running distributed, synchronized computer networks is not rocket science...how do the folks at NERC explain the NYSE quick recovery from a ground zero attack?  There was no report of crippling loss of financial information...at least that I am aware of.  Even a small operation like APX operates their systems using distributed computing and synchronized data.

For NERC to use the NIMDA virus as a specific attack on the electrical grid operation and the compromising of reliability is preposterous and the resulting ""service denials"" cited are probably refusal(s) of tags, which from what I understand, the utilities probably cause much more self-inflicted havoc than this virus!

The press release you refer to just confirms NERC's position of maintaining status quo.  Should we ""call"" NERC on these statements?  The remarks made in these public statements seem irresponsible.

This is probably one of the stupidest things I have ever heard.  NERC is about as secure as a convenience store at two in the morning.  They have almost no experience dealing with security, either cyber or otherwise. They are using the terrorist attacks on the 11th as a reason to blow the dust off all their old Y2K contingency plans and cash in on people's fears to strengthen their position.

In any case, I would suspect that a large RTO with a significant budget is much more likely to be secure than a dues based NERC. Look at NERC's offices.  They are in a shopping mall.  How secure is that?  Last time I visited, they didn't even have any sort of identity cards or badge system or anything - the whole place was wide open.  Anyone could walk in off the street and shut down a large portion of NERC's infrastructure by just randomly unplugging computers.  

Contrast that with places like ISO-NE and NY-ISO, who have significant levels of security in their systems that are extremely sophisticated and complex. Or compare that with the MISO's hardened facility, capable of withstanding an F-4 tornado hit.  You tell me whether NERC or RTOs are going to be more secure.

Dave is right on with his classification of the idea of NIMDA being an attack on the electric utility industry as preposterous.  That's akin to saying that a chain letter is an attack on the banking industry because bank statements come in the mail.  And Dan points out a more valid thing to consider - a terrorist isn't going to attack a tariff desk, market system, or security coordinator; they will attack nuclear units, substations, and other installations that actually matter.   

I echo Dave's question - do we want to ""call"" NERC on this issue?  It would be a very simple exercise to point to NERC's many security failings, including some initiatives they are currently sitting on.  Bringing up the right details in the right forums could really undermine their reputation and nip this positioning in the bud.

(By the way - am I the only one who got a kick out of that article pointing out this 3rd grade cleverness of ""NIMDA is ADMIN spelled backwards""?  Gotta love journalists - always trying to find an angle.  Next they'll say that the 60 in ""2600"" refers to the frequency of the interconnection!)

some help on where Enron stands on current legislation as it relates to his

Overall, this is still too detailed than what we would like.  But if we want to provide feedback to EEI, here are some key items.

""(D) assures that no two industry sectors have the ability to control, and no one industry sector has the ability to veto, the electric reliability organization's discharge of its responsibilities;

This is problematic, the GISB process works because it allows exactly that any one sector can stop the progress.  This provides a huge incentive for all to work towards agreement from the beginning and minimizes the use of hidden agendas.


""(G) establishes fair and impartial procedures for enforcement of organization standards, either directly or through delegation to an affiliated regional reliability entity, including the imposition of penalties; limitations on activities, functions, or operations; or other appropriate sanctions;

BUT:

""(B) permits voluntary membership to any user of the bulk-power system, state representative, consumer representative or public interest group;
How can they be voluntary and have enforcement?

""(3) The Commission shall give due weight to the technical expertise of the electric reliability organization with respect to the technical content of a new or modified organization standard.  The Commission shall not defer to the organization with respect to the competitive implications of implementing the standard or the effect of the standard on competition.

This appears better than the NERC langauge but still assumes the ability to look at 2 separate types of standards - technical reliability and commercial business. 
Why not focus on what the Commission shall do - and not what they should not do?  ""The Commission shall consider and give appropriate weighting to both technical and commercial impacts in organization standards.""
 
""(g)	ORGANIZATION MEMBERSHIP- Every system operator shall be required to be a member of the electric reliability organization and any affiliated regional reliability entity or entities in whose geographic area it operates or is responsible for operating bulk-power system facilities.

Such language has the potential to tie the hands of an organization to become heavily weighted with utility types.  (g) should recognize that RTOs will consolidate much of the individual control area operators need for representation.  Remember, the asset owners, different from the operators, will want to be members too.  Also, it must ensure that the funding mechanism will not influence the membership make-up such that it memberhip becomes un-balanced.  But the real key is fixing ""D"" - any sector should be able to stop progress."

Concerning Christi's question on whether we need a computer group looking at the question of redundancy of systems, I don't think we need it at this point.  It is a given that a complete backup system for all commercial aspects of the systems will be required, along with a handoff protocol for emergency control over all transmission operational aspects of the systems.  The specifics of these need to be decided when the hierarchy of each RTO is determined."

If you will recall, when EPAct'92 was passed, the usual view was that FERC could order wheeling, but only on a case by case basis.  There had been an effort to include an RTG provision in the bill, but it died when the conference committee was finalizing the bill.  There was a view by many in the West at the time, that it would still be better to move ahead with self-implementation of open access rather than waiting for litigation.  In the summer of 1994, first WRTA (Western Regional Transmission Assocation) then SWRTA (Southwestern Regional Transmission Association) and NRTA (Northwest Regional Transmission Association) were filed.  They were developed in an open process that included, perhaps for the first time, the transmission owners, the transmission dependent utilities, new market entrants and state regulators.  The IPPs and Marketers were participants, including Enron, Electric Clearing House (now Dynegy), DesTec, CalPine, Tenaska, etc.  FERC responded in November telling WRTA that it would have to accept comparable transmission access.  Instead of collapsing as predicted by the ""just say no"" crowd, the members accepted the conditions and accepted those conditions.  WRTA formed in June of 1995.  
 
While the RTGs appear rather tame today, at the time they challenged the traditional view, offering to provide open access tariffs.  When the FERC issued the NOPR that gave us Orders 888/889 just prior to WRTAs formation, the participants in the three Western RTGs members responded during the summer of 1995 by working together to develop the key concepts of what became OASIS.  With the filing of the current OATTs, much of the ground breaking work of the RTGs was done, but they remained a forum for discussion of the interface between commercial and reliablity.  A common planning data base was developed in which included non-traditional participants and their ideas to be included.  The Western Market Interface Committee (WMIC) was organized by the RTGs and has had a continuing role in bringing the the three (soon to be two?) RTOs proposals together.
 
When the Western RTGs were organized in 1995 they were formed outside of WSCC.  WSCC had a very restrictive policy, allowing only utilities to be members.  When they grudgingly allowed IPPs to join, it was still by half-measures.  For instance, WSCC would allow only employees of the member to attend, so new, small members could not employ a consultant for joint representation.  When the RTG discussions were underway, the good old boys wanted it inside WSCC with the same kinds of restrictions.  We broke that mold, formed separately and then through the FERC order approving WRTA force WSCC to open its membership fully or to face the creating of a separate planning organization.  The change passed by one vote, but the change occured.
 
Once all the organizations were up and running (WSCC, WRTA, NRTA, SWRTA) it was obvious that there was substantial duplication of meetings and functions.   Serions talks of a merger began in about 1998.  They went very slowly, but finally produced a common organization to be called the Western Electric Coordinating Council (WECC), which would merge WSCC, WRTA and SWRTA together initially.  NRTA will likely vote to merge as well.  WECC is a RRG as far as NERC is concerned.  
 
While the new bylaws do not go as far as I would have liked, they do further open up the WSCC process and provide for some consideration of the commercial impact of reliablity rules.  Is this a transitional phase? Perhaps.  Does it go as far as the EISB proposal?  No, but I see no reason to play ""smash-em, bash-em"" will every effort that hasn't followed the latest turn in our thinking.  As I hope this memo shows, we have been evolving the industry, never as fast as Enron or others (myself included) have wanted it to change.  The WECC will reconsititue the WSCC board under new membership rules and opens the possiblity of changing the entrenched senior staff as WSCC to breath some life into the organization.  At a minimum, the change from WSCC/WRTA/SWRTA/NRTA to WECC will provide interim improvement while the debate over EISB works its way to a conclusion and further change takes place.

Some comments.  I removed some words I though made NERC look too respectable/official, embellished some of your points, added a section on RTO security risk, and added some stronger ""chastisement"" words at the end.  They may be too strong, but I think the paper needs to be assertive.  Out of curiosity, is there an intended audience?  If it is NERC, maybe the more passive approach is preferable, but if it is anyone else, then maybe the aggressiveness would be a good thing. I think we want to make sure the audience finishes by looking at NERC and shaking their head in disgust, rather than sighing and shrugging their shoulders.  Of course, that could backfire and make us look like we're unfairly attacking NERC without any provocation, especially given the esoteric nature of some of our points.

Here is a summary of the work of this task force.  Bill Rust has been 
attending  the meetings and I have been closley coordinating our positions.

The PFTF set out to develop a means to capture native load impacts (not 
tagged) in load flow models to ensure that parallel flows resulting from 
native load dispatch are accounted for accurately to assess system security.  
This has largely been ignored in the past since most TLRs hit only non-firm 
PTP transactions.  However, the NERC TLR procedures (in line with FERC OATT) 
requires a pro-rata curtailment of native and network service with Firm 
point-to-point (PTP).  Since more and more TLRs at Level 5 (Firm) have been 
utilized and is expected to rise, providers are being forced by the MIC to 
demonstrate comparability at these TLR levels.  In order to demonstrate 
comparability - a transparent calculation of Native and Network impacts is 
needed.  In past, this was left to the discretion of each control area. 

The task force reviewed 7 methods on how to model native gen to native load 
dispatch.  

These seven methods can be grouped into three categories:
1) Continue with the existing method that does not consider counterflows.
2) Inlcude counterflows for NNL (Native/Network Load) and PTP and assign to 
sink control area.
3) Assign NNL counterflows to the control area and PTP counterflows to the 
purchasing selling entitiy (PSE). 

Each method tries to simulate real-time dispatch realizing that an 
interconnection-wide state estimator is not available nor a nodal dispatch 
model.
 
The simplest methods (group 1) adjust each generator individually to a set of 
load points in its control area and repeats until all the units in the 
control area are accounted for.   The problem for the transmission owners 
with this approach is that the netting effects of the real-time dispatch are 
not captured therfore exaggerating the impacts a control area has on its 
neighbors. Group 1 solutions were rejected because the task force beleived 
that its parent, the Security Subcommittee (Dick Ingersoll member) insisted 
on a new procedure that included counterflows - for security reasons.

The initial proposal to include netted effects (Group 2) allows control areas 
to net NNL flows within the control area and PTP to net flows that are 
grouped by sink control area. Group 2 solutions were rejected because PSEs 
would not get credit for off-setting transactions that sink in other control 
areas, e.g. I have a PTP that sinks in TVA that off-sets a PTP that sinks in 
SOCO. Group 2 solutions would not give credit for this.

The most complex method (group 3) allows the native load dispatch to net 
their impacts with all internal gen-load pairings AND nets the contributions 
of point-to-point tagged transactions by PSE.  This is the most equitable 
solution for the market, however it is the most costly and demanding solution 
for the transmission owner/operators. Group 3 solutions were acceptable to 
all parties because it assigned credit to those who are sponsoring 
transactions that relieve the flow gate loading.

Lately, I have been pushed in NERC activities to make calls that boil down to 
what is fair and equitable between native loads and point-to-point service 
vs. what increased burden and accountability on providers is needed to 
provide for that level of comparability.

We should always hold providers to the higher standard.  That is - it is not 
easy to facilitate market transactions, and yes - real people and real 
dollars are needed to be expended by providers to continue facilitating an 
increasingly complex and evolving marketplace.  Providers cannot be let off

What security measures with regard to the electric grid does Enron support?

NERC remains in Full Alert Status.  Per the Electricity Sector Information Sharing and Analysis Center (ES-ISAC), suggested actions at Full Alert may include:  selected maintenance curtailment; selected additional generation reserves in various states of readiness; staffing of backup control facilities; examination of connections of computers to outside communications, including the Internet and modems; and maintenance of close coordination with first responders, local law enforcement, and the local FBI.  In case of a specific threat to the grid, operators may take actions that include reducing transfers across interfaces to increase local control of generation dispatch patterns.  ENRON SUPPORTS ACTIONS NECESSARY TO SAFEGUARD THE GRID FROM ATTACKS.

Does Enron's position on information flow about electric grids contradict its stance on restricting certain information about gas pipeline operations for security reasons?

No.  Certain pipeline information that could be used to identify the physical location of assets has been restricted to those within the industry.  Pipeline information important for the operation of gas markets remains available to market participants.  The NERC action, however, restricts electric grid information even to market participants who need it in order to ensure the efficient operation of the wholesale electricity market."

Apparently, he has been working with DoE on a security project that he expects will be funded by them.  I believe this will be the digital certificate type of security the OSC has talked about in the past (the E-Marc proposal).  Instead of being used as originally intended to provide authentication functions for reservations and scheduling, it looks like it is being considered for securing informational items as well.  From what I understand, Pacific Northwest National Labs and Lockheed Martin have been in discussions with NERC about providing service under this DoE initiative.

He also stated that NERC plans to limit access to more data soon - perhaps as much as the entire NERC website, so that viewers must be registered with NERC, in order to do background checks and such before giving access. 

One caveat - Bob sometimes likes to inflate his work to make himself appear more important (check me out, I'm talking to DoE and big contractors), so this may really be a few casual phone calls and general statements, rather than any sort of formal project.  But given the action we've seen lately, it may be a real project we should be investigating further.  I expect that once the board gives the go ahead, NERC plans to run this through as quickly as possible and rush for a quick implementation.  

I would guess the likely approach is going to be, following an approving board decision, a relatively quick lockdown of their site, to be followed by a priority-one security infrastructure project like the one described in my first paragraph.  I would not be surprised if they also encourage other entities to lockdown their systems more tightly.  

I don't know if there is any real action we can take right now, but obviously, this draws more attention to the issue as we move forward into next week.  Obviously, please be discreet in mentioning these details, as I don't want Bob to get skittish.  These issues may not be confidential, but then again, they might.

Please also note that I did not include Dick Ingersoll on this communiqu?.  I am not sure under what disclosure policies he is still bound (if any).

They (the Board) clearly see that FERC would have overall approval of regulatory commercial standards and practices. They know that NERC has to ""compete"" for a role in a future model for the industry.. and would like to organization to have a future.

On a parallel track, we hear that there is lots of interest in reliability legislation. We need to keep track of what is happening there.

Resolution on the Role of NERC in Developing Market Interface or Commercial Practice Standards 
(Board Agenda Item 20)

WHEREAS, Reliability standards developed by NERC, relying on the expertise of industry experts, have been the basis for the reliable operation of the bulk electric systems in North America for over 30 years; and

WHEREAS, With the opening of the transmission systems, the vertical disaggregating of the former monopoly utilities, and the introduction of marketers and independent power producers, NERC has moved proactively to make its standards process more fair, open, balanced and inclusive; and

WHEREAS, To support the evolution of competitive electricity markets, the formation of large RTOs, and continued reliability and security of interconnected transmission grids, it is vitally important to standardize and make mandatory both reliability standards and wholesale electric business practice standards; and

WHEREAS, NERC has taken a number of proactive steps to deal with the linkages between reliability standards and wholesale electric business practice standards, including spearheading the OASIS ""What"" and ""How"" working groups that developed the Standards and Communications Protocols followed by all transmission providers; formed a Market Interface Committee as a new standing committee of NERC to address the impact of reliability standards on markets and the impact of market practices on reliability; and initiated the formation of and facilitates the Electronic Scheduling Collaborative (ESC), which recently filed with FERC a report on their efforts to develop common business practice standards for electronic scheduling (OASIS Phase 2); and 

WHEREAS, the electric business practice standards being developed by the Electronic Scheduling Collaborative (ESC) are a complement to the new NERC Reliability Model on which NERC's future Organization Standards will be based; and 

WHEREAS, NERC is recognized and respected as the industry's developer of standards for the reliable planning and operation of interconnected transmission grids throughout North America, and

WHEREAS, the Board of Trustees recognizes the urgent need for uniform wholesale electric business practice standards that are well coordinated with reliability standards; and

WHEREAS, the NERC Stakeholders Committee has expressed a strong preference for a single organization to develop both reliability standards and wholesale electric business practice standards;

BE IT THEREFORE RESOLVED, that NERC:

1.	Take all necessary steps to become the single organization in North America to develop both reliability standards and wholesale electric business practice standards through a fair, open, balanced, and inclusive process, and to file such standards with FERC and appropriate government agencies in Canada.

2.	Actively solicit cooperation, collaboration, and support from Canadian and U.S. government entities to establish NERC as the single organization in North America for the development of reliability standards and wholesale electric business practice standards.

3.	Take immediate action to adopt and implement the six Initial Recommendations of the Standing Committee Representation Task Force contained in Board Agenda Item 22.

4.	Facilitate - jointly with interested trade associations; federal, state, and provincial regulators; and other stakeholder organizations - an open and inclusive process to achieve consensus on the definitions and attributes of the functions necessary for the development of wholesale electric industry standards and practices, and on a course of action to institute such capabilities.

5.	Interface with state and provincial regulators to address retail operational issues that may affect wholesale electric operations.

6.	Build on the results of activities to date regarding the new Reliability Model and new Organization Standards Development Process.

7.	Recommend that FERC use the ESC report, which has already been submitted to FERC, as the basis for a notice of proposed rulemaking on electric business practice standards.

8.	Urge FERC to make use of the ESC, which will use the new sector weighted voting model approved by the NERC Board, for further development of wholesale electric business practice standards, including standards necessary for certain aspects of RTO design such as congestion management and ancillary services.

9.	Commit to continuing to support the work of the ESC until such time as an industry consensus is achieved on how to develop wholesale electric business practice standards within the NERC framework.

Subject:	RE: BOT Support for the ESC and Sector Voting

Charles, Jose, Jim, and Rick, 

I would like to send the letter below out to the ESC.  Before I do so, do you have any objections?  I would like to put some fire under this issue, as the ""new sector weighted voting model"" seems to be yet another way to preserve the power of the traditional utility.  However, I don't know if we will compromise any of our other positions by stirring this particular pot.  Thoughts?

Andy



Gordon,

When did the ESC vote to adopt the  ""new sector weighted voting model?""  Has the ESC been absorbed into NERC, and is the NERC Board ordering them to use this new model?  If so, is the ESC a new standing committee?  Do they report directly to the board? Just where would the ESC fit in NERC?

Unless the ESC votes to change their charter to say they are a group under NERCs control, I don't see how this can move forward as written.  The ESC has never been a NERC group, but instead a industry collaborative which NERC has assisted with administrative matters (facilitation, meeting schedules, etc...).  If I recall correctly, there was a significant number of people that specifically did not _want_ the ESC to be a NERC group, (APPA, ELCON, EPSA, and a few others, if I remember correctly).  This was why the NERC ESTF became the non-NERC ESC.  I expect several entities will have comments to make before just handing the keys to NERC.  

Of course, those comments may have already been made at the Board, and may have been addressed there.  But I seriously don't think NERC can just ""annex"" the ESC without the ESC voting to be annexed.  

Other members of the ESC - do you share this concern?

1.	We focused the discussions on the lack of action by the NAERO board.  I mentioned the lack of action on Independence of Security Coordinators.  Anderson responded by indicating that they weren't ready to go there because weren't quite sure if they could get the industry to agree - made our point.  Also, pointed out that the old agreement was only if comprehensive legislation is passed.

2.	Rick used the analogy that NAERO has done nothing to earn our deference to their legislation.  Jeff used the FASB - SEC model as an example of what a good relationship could look like.  Why should we support anointing NERC to the post while they have done nothing to ""earn our respect"".

3.	Dave Cook discussed the problems with PJM - (1) canada involvement, (2) FERC didn't have technical staff.  I don't think that the Canada problem was too great.  The other issue seems to play right into the point - there will be alot of deference to a group on technical matters but getting the independence right is important.

4.	While Jeff indicated that PJM is better, Rick highlighted that we weren't agreeing to that either.  Still problems (such as funding).

5.	I still don't like the term SRO - selfregulating standards organiation.  Should just be a standards organization.  

Anderson is calling Rick to set up a meeting between Jeff and the NAERO board.

Rick Shapiro and Jim Steffes were present on the call.

John Anderson's purpose for the call with Jeff was to find out what Enron wanted to see in legislation in order for Enron to give deference to NERC to become a Self-Regulated Organization for setting reliability standards.

Jeff explained that the PJM version has a more likeable approach than the NERC version, PJM's is less prescriptive and relies more on FERC participation in establishing a ""SRO"".  Additionally, funding concerns are not addressed in either version and a viable funding mechanism that does not rely on Regional Councils is needed.

Jeff also would like to make a presentation (as soon as possible) to the NERC Board of Trustees of the key items Enron would like to see resolved that would provide Enron enough confidence that the NERC/NAERO organization would be independent enough from the stakeholders and be willing enough to tackle the industry's toughest issues concerning competitive markets in electricity.  

I will be working with the Enron-NERC team on a breifing paper of what we want NERC to fix in current NERC rules and processes for NERC to demonstrate it is worthy of the ""SRO"" status.  Some example issues include:
1) Indpendence requirements for operators and Security Coordinators
2) competitive advantages of control areas - parking and hubbing
3) competitive advantages of native and network service - source and sink data requirements

The timing of next week's meeting to ""resolve"" the legislation  reflects the legislative realities that the committees of jurisdiction in Congress will take up the realibility legislation, along with other electricity issues, as early as the second week of September.  In fact, congressional staff in the Senate and House are drafting legislative language on electricity issues during the August recess.  They have pressed the ""coalition"" for a final work product.

I gathered that at least some of what Jeff'spresentation to the NERC board would be about concerns matters beyond the legislation as such, but since they go to the NERC board's operation and independence, may go to our comfort level with NERC as the standards setting organization.

Given the issues and concerns that have been addressed and communicated to NERC, and our preference for the PJM model (as Jeff told John Q. Anderson in the conference call), I think NERC got the information it wanted to get out of the call even though it didn't like the answers: i.e., whether Sarah and I have been faithfully representing Enron's position, whether Enron supports an ""SRO"" type organization; and whether there is anything they can do to get us on board.

Perhaps we should have another conference call early next week so that Sarah and I have our guidance from everyone going into the August 9th meeting.  For one thing, we need to determine if we are in any position to provide detailed comments on the ""shortened NERC"" version at the August 9th meeting or whether we do not wish to engage them on what specific changes it would take to get us on board.

My sense is that since we have to deal with the players in the room on other issues, our overall position will be strengthened if we have some specific comments to make to explain our decision not to support NERC's version, even the shortened one.  Don't get me wrong -- we have plenty of good reasons not to, I just wasn't sure how ""engaged"" we wanted to be in identifying changes that would bring us on board since I gather our opposition is more fundamental (no Western deference, budget concerns, independence issues, etc.).

John

We are concerned how this meeting impacts what transpired between John Q Anderson and Jeff Skilling on the conference call on Thursday.

David Cook was on the call as well and we do not understand the sudden urgency for NERC to reach closure.  Has NERC given up on Enron?

As we understand it, John Q Anderson agreed to give Jeff an opportunity to present present before the NERC Board some ke y issues for Enron before trying to finalize any NERC legislation proposal.   Does this meeting next week preclude that presentation from occurring?  Or will there be willingness to alter the language significantly enough to appease the Enron concerns next week?

It will decide who uses the system, how it will be used, what schedules will be accepted, etc.  Do we really want it to set the standards by its performance is to be judged by others?  There are two tendencies to guard against.  (1)  Most of these organizations are going to be not-for-profit ISOs in form.  There may be a tendency to use very stringent rules to minimize outage risk and criticism of the RTO's management.  This could require the construction of facilities when they are not completly necessary.  (2) The opposite possiblity exists, namely, that they will adjust rules to cover their own mistakes.  I think the former problem is the most likely.  

If the RTOs take over the NERC role as suggested, then the reliability rules would have to become part of the FERC tariff.  In order to judge the validity of the ""reliability provisions"" of the tariffs the FERC will be required to develop expertise it does not have.  In practice NERC doesn't have the expertise either.  It really resides in the members of the committees and is thus derived from the industry.  By having a separate Standards Setting Organization, the rules can still be established using the expertise of the industry.  The SSO would propose rules which FERC would accept subject to complaint.  The SSO's governance has to be fair, but I am not personally concerned about it being indepenent as long as FERC has oversight. It is the service provider (the RTO) that needs to be independent.  The standards in most industries are set in this way.  The power of the state to enforce the rules come from commissions of various types.  For instance, the National Electric Code is developed by the industry, but its enforcement is accomplished by adopting it into building codes, state liscensing requirements, etc.  In the same way, the SSO can develop the reliability rules which are incorporated in FERC's requirement imposed on the RTO.  The RTO's tariff would incorporate them by reference.  If the RTOs performance violates the rules or if a generator doesn't hold up its requirements, then ADR/FERC action can be taken to enforce.

My reason for this long message is to draw attention to the fact that the major function of the RTO is provision of transmission service.  It should not see itself as a regulator.  The case of the CAISO is instructive, since they think they are above compliance with rules since the believe they are the guardians of the public interest.  When the service provider thinks it regulates to comes to believe it has a right to decide who ""should"" have transmission service rather than get on with providing it.

The following discussion is to bring you up to date on the latest NERC activities on reliability legislation that was a subject on the weekly ENRON-NERC team conference call.

John Shelk explained that NERC has significantly reduced the length of its proposed ""Title on Reliability"" so as to look more like the PJM approach.  Fundamentally, there are still major differences.  NERC continues to push for the embodiment of deference by FERC to the ""SRO"" in the legislation.  

Given the conference call last week with John Q Anderson, Dave Cook and Jeff Skilling, we were concerned how the upcoming meeting on Aug 9 by NERC stakeholders to ""finalize"" the NERC version would impact Jeff's request to speak with the Independent Board members before accepting any form of deference to NERC to become the SRO (or the term we prefer Standards Setting Organization - SSO).

The meeting on the 9th should not interfere with Jeff's ability to present issues to the Board.  We don't think Jeff needs to contact John Q Anderson or any NERC members about the Aug 9 meeting.  However, for the discussions with NERC, John Shelk plans to ""stay the line"" on the Enron position of keeping authority to defer to any SSO with FERC and to keep any language that defers to the SSO out of the legislation.  

Jeff should still be able to argue for key Board action items, and if Enron is appeased, deference to NERC could still be given - but not through legislation, rather through FERC ""comfort"" that the SSO is doing a good job.  By knowing that FERC can ""pull the plug"" on the SSO if it is not satisfied, this will provide the correct incentive for the SSO to ensure that no industry segment dominates the standards setting process.

I am completing a draft of issues that we want the Independents to resolve/address for Jeff Skilling to take to the Board.
Additionally, Andy Rodriquez and I will develop a summary of examples of why NERC, in its current form, is not able to develop consensus rules that all its members are willing to comply with.  These examples should be powerful arguments for John Shelk to leverage in arguments for FERC authority in the legislation.  

We also discussed the need to shop our reliability legislation principles with Pat Wood and perhaps DOE.

FERC cannot directly ""amend"" a proposed standard (I was told this is because the Canadians would object to FERC telling them what to do directly); however, FERC can remand a proposed standard to the ERO for a modification by a date certain.  The proposed standard is not implemented until the modification is made.  (In some cases, a proposed standard takes effect automatically if FERC fails to act on the proposed standard within a specified period of time.)

At the GISB - EPSA meeting last Thurs, the GISB people clearly stated that GISB has NO authority over its members, it is 100% voluntary.  All the muscle lies in FERC and any governmental agency that is willing to adopt the GISB standard.  Agencies in Mexico for example have adopted certain GISB standards.  In fact, ANSI acreditaion requires that the standards setting organization NOT to have authority.  So it makes sense for FERC to not amend a proposed standard since other agencies will have to be able to adopt it.(e.g.- Canada)  I don't see a problem with this - but this makes the consensus building process even more important since the final product must be amenable to any and all relevant governement authorities.  

This is a good reason why the legislation cannot give deference to the ERO, especially one which proposes to have compliance and enforcement authority as NERC's proposal.  If NERC is going to set standards AND have compliance authority over its members - then the ANSI acreditation they claim to be getting will not be the same as that of GISB.  ANSI does not allow this combination.  If the deference language is in the legislation - that means the GISB/EISB proposal is excluded from FERC's choice.  FERC needs to be aware of this.  So why does the voluntary GISB process with FERC oversight model work? 

It is the very nature of knowing FERC has final authority that makes the consensus building process work - not the threat of the ERO's compliance authority over its members as NERC approaches this.  In GISB, the  members know that if they do not produce a standard that all its members and FERC can live with - FERC will not adopt it, nor can FERC amend it - and since no enforcement mechanism will be behind the mis-guided standard (remember it is 100% voluntary), it becomes a worthless exercise.  This is a powerful incentive.   

On the other hand, NERC's approach of a standards organization with enforcement power sets the stage for power struggles between sectors and knocks down the consensus building attitude the GISB process encourages.   Compliance and penalites are not assigned or targeted to every member/sector.  Certain parties are impacted by certain standards - and in different ways. For example - a congestion management standard will affect a control area very differently than it would a power marketer.  The penalites may not apply at all to the marketers who want to protect themselves by making the congestion management penalites as harsh as possible and vice versa for the control areas.  If the ERO doles out compliance without FERC approval - then the standards will become a battleground over compliance and penalties. The point is the enforcement and penalty debate will drive sector arguments and will cloud the real task of developing an equitable congestion management standard."

At a EPSA sponsored meeting on Aug 9, the GISB Chair and Rae McQuade sat down and we went through what it takes to get EISB rolling and how they would tackle the tough issues at NERC.

I beleive the EPSA folks in the room, Mirant, Dynegy, Ontario Power Gen, Enron, Exelon, Calpine  and ELCON all felt that there shouls be one organization setting standards because of the inherent risks of assuming reliability and commercial issues can be sleanly separated.  We came away from the meeting with a comfort level that the GISB process will provide the right mechanism to resolve this age old debate - I don't care what kind of standard you call it - if you write it - it must be put through the GISB/EISB wringer.  GISB recommended that perhaps what we know as NERC today could be given a segment in the energy quadrant.
 
Also to respond to Sarah's note about support for an SRO - no entity in the room supported that FERC give deference to ANY standards organization - not NERC, NAERO, GISB or RTOs.  So I think we need to hold tight to this issue and we will be able to rally support for it.

I will speak at the GISB conference next Wed, Aug 15 at DOE.  I am working with Mark Bennett and other EPSA folks on key principles of what EPSA wants from the EISB Strawman.

I have attached notes I put together that will evolve into the statements I will make on behalf of EPSA.

Please proviede me your thoughts.

Also - I agree with Dick, today, NERC is 12.5 million dollars annually, and mostly utility dollars.  If we are going to push for a EISB, we have to provide some carrot for these utilities to agree to let EISB do this.  NERC (and their supporters) will fall on their sword on funding and the reult will be we have 2 organizations setting standards if NERC cannot agree to become a part of the EISB process.  

And one more thing, I don't know how much commitment Jeff Skilling feels he has to the Independent Baord members, many of which he helped get seated.  But pushing for EISB and perhaps wrapping NERC into it as the reliability piece (GISB's suggestion) - may render the Independents obsolete.  I don't know if are wedded to them."

RE: Reliability Legislation

We are providing you with this memo to provide some information and perspective on the important issues relating to federal legislation in advance of our August 20th joint Regulatory Affairs and Legislative Affairs meeting on reliability legislation.

Reliability Legislation

S. 2071

S. 2071, sponsored by Sen. Slade Gorton (R-WA), was approved by the Senate in the last Congress.  The House of Representatives did not act on the bill.  S. 2071 represents the only consensus bill to be approved by either chamber.  

This legislation would establish a national electric reliability organization (ERO) with the authority to establish and enforce mandatory reliability standards.  

FERC would have primary jurisdiction over:

? the electric reliability organization (ERO);

? all Affiliated Regional Reliability Entities (entities to which authority would 
  be delegated to enforce compliance with reliability standards); 

? all system operators; and 

? all users of the bulk-power system. 

The bill prescribes procedural guidelines for FERC approval of applications competing for status as the ERO and ERO standards. It would also require all users of the transmission system to comply with such standards.

What causes us some concern are a number of provisions in the legislation that would delegate authority to different entities.  The bill would:

? Allow the ERO, subject to FERC approval, to delegate authority to a 
  requesting regional entity to implement and enforce compliance with 
  standards.  

? Include a broad savings clause which preserves state authority to ""ensure 
  the safety, adequacy and reliability of electric service within each state."" 

? Not ensure that the boundaries of ARREs and RTOs are the same, 
  although it would instruct ARREs to cooperate with RTOs to ensure 
  enforcement of standards. 

A similar bill - H.R. 2602 - was introduced in the House last session by Rep. Albert Wynn (D-MD). No action was taken on this bill.  The same language is included in the comprehensive energy bill introduced by Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee Chairman Jeff Bingaman (D-NM).  

Other Developments
 
Last year, in response to failed attempts by the Congress to pass comprehensive electricity legislation, a number of groups headed by NERC, sent a letter to House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert (R-IL), calling for the passage of stand alone reliability legislation.  The letter is attached.  A number of groups, including public power groups, the California ISO, Edison Electric Institute, NARUC and the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association all signed the letter.  

EPSA was strongly pressured to sign the letter to add more weight and credibility to the effort.  However, we did not sign the letter.  While we stated that we did not oppose the letter, EPSA's position at the time was the advocacy for comprehensive federal legislation. 

Last month, a number of groups with interests in reliability legislation met in Washington in an attempt to forge an agreement on legislation that can be supported by industry stakeholders.  Efforts were made to shorten the existing legislation similar to the bill introduced by Rep. Albert Wynn without changing the intent of provisions in the language.  In addition to EPSA, other groups in attendance included NARUC, the Pennsylvania PUC, Entergy, PJM , Public Power Groups, Consumer Groups, ELCON, Mirant and Enron.  The meeting produced a realization among the participants on the wide difference of opinions on how best to proceed.  The state PUCs lobbied for a continued state role in reliability language.  Entergy supported the original language contained in the Bingaman bill.  Still, a number of other groups favored the shorter PJM version.  

PJM Proposal

PJM recently circulated condensed reliability language.  The 4-page bill would give enforcement authority to FERC.  If you would like a copy faxed to you, please contact Michael Reddy (mreddy@epsa.org) at EPSA.  Additionally, FERC would establish reliability standards and will maintain primary jurisdiction.  FERC would designate a national reliability entity composed of a number of regional entities for the purpose of developing reliability standards for the transmission system.  

Some concerns over the PJM language include:

? Formation of regional entities that would be a ""bottoms up"" organization. 
  These entities would have no regard to how they conform with RTOs. 

? Reliability standards would be developed as voluntary consensus 
  standards

? The regions and the national entity would be on equal ground.

Revised NERC language

Just last Thursday NERC convened another meeting for the purposes of attempting to shorten the original NERC language.  Working off of the language found in the Wynn bill, the new language was shortened to 16 pages.  The red-lined version is attached.  Among the noteworthy changes:

? p. 6, applications for approval to become the ERO, strikes language to 
  specify funding mechanisms and requirements.  

? p. 13, changes in filings of funding and funding procedures, language 
  deleted on specifics on changes to funding.

? p. 21, additional language added to state that neither the ERO nor FERC 
  will have the authority to order construction of additional generation or 
  transmission if it determines a need.

? p. 22, language on coordination with RTOs deleted.

Status and Prospects of Legislation

The Republican House and the leadership of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, chaired by Rep. W.J. ""Billy"" Tauzin (R-LA) and Subcommittee on Energy and Air Quality Chairman Joe Barton (R-TX) has maintained the position that electricity should be addressed in a comprehensive fashion.  This is a continuation of the position held by Former House Commerce Chairman Tom Bliley (R-VA).   Staff for Chairman Tauzin are in the process of developing electricity provisions during the August recess.  It is likely that one of the titles will be on reliability.   

The Senate, with its recent switch in control, remains uncertain on the overall view of stand alone reliability legislation.  In its present version, Senate Energy Chairman Bingaman's bill contains the same reliability provisions found in the Wynn bill.  Chairman Bingaman also plans to markup legislation in the Fall.  

Regulatory/NERC/GISB Developments

While the timing and details of reliability legislation remain uncertain, NERC has continued its effort to transition to NAERO.  When first envisioned several years ago, the legislative objective was to establish NAERO as a self-regulatory organization with authority to enforce mandatory reliability standards.  Legislative delays, however, led the NERC Board to take unilateral steps to advance the transition, beginning with its governance structure. 

Last February, the 38 member board was replaced by a new board of ten independent board members.  Members of the former board then were reconstituted as the new Stakeholder Committee with an advisory role, in addition to authority to participate in funding, board member changes and a few other general matters.  Also, the board implemented a compliance program based upon contracts to be executed by the Regional Reliability Councils.  Funding for NERC, presently administered by the regions, remains an extremely problematic, open question, as is the continued dominance of transmission providers in the current NERC Standing Committee voting structure.

The GISB proposal to include a wholesale electric quadrant in the new Energy Industry Standards Board (EISB) has provided an alternative that didn't exist at the time the NAERO concept, and related legislative effort, began.  The EISB model, which would combine the development of gas and electric retail and wholesale standards, initially viewed as a remote prospect when it was floated in early 2000, has gained substantial momentum.  

During FERC's June 19th technical conference on Function 8 and interregional coordination, the Commissioners compared the circumstances in the gas industry that led to the formation of GISB with those of the electric industry today.  In separate letters to GISB Executive Director Rae McQuade dated August 13th, Commissioners Massey, Wood and Brownell observed the need to develop uniform rules and standards and expressed enthusiastic support for a new EISB to do it.  Those letters were distributed during an industry conference hosted by the Department of Energy (DOE) on August 14 - 15th, further contributing to the credibility of the EISB proposal.

Meanwhile, the pressure that the EISB proposal is generating clearly appears to have become part of the overall context for NERC's reform effort, as well as the reliability legislation.  A task force set up by the NERC Stakeholder Committee is reviewing how to make the three Standing Committees more ""open and inclusive,"" including possible recommendations to change the voting structure from the current 50/50 (transmission provider/transmission customer) to a sector approach.  The NERC board may receive those recommendations, and other possible NERC reforms, including a new Organization Standards Process, when it meets in October.  

The effort to launch an EISB is expected to come to a head when the GISB board meets on September 19th.  There are indications that the board will approve going forward with the proposal.  Such action would considerably raise the stakes for the NERC board, and present challenging issues regarding how to set up the voting sectors within the wholesale electric quadrant.  

Additionally, the industry will need to consider how to more precisely define the types of standards the new organization would develop.  The emergence of a new EISB, if it occurs, could potentially diverge from legislation that presumes that NERC/NAERO will be the only standard setting organization.  Granting a new NAERO authority over ""reliability"" will beg serious questions regarding its scope of activities, and create the specter of multiple organizations that many hope to avoid."

Marketer - Jose Bestard, Vice President, Government Affairs - Enron

Marketer - Craig Lsser, Senior Vice President, External and Regulatory Affairs - Mirant
		(an unknown in the NERC arena, Mirant of course is the former SoCo unaffiliated marketer, I have seen Miranat 			members participate in EPSA working groups)

As you know, the Stakeholder Committee is an advisory body to the Independent Board of Trusteess.  The scope of its activites include but is not limited to NERC Budget approval - which is growing from a 2001 amount of $12.3 million to a proposed 2002 $13 million.

system: the Potential Adjust List (PAL).

As you may or may not know, there is currently an ""Adjust List"" that is 
issued when TLRs are called. An ""Adjust List"" is a recommendation from the 
IDC that describes what transactions should be cut and by how much to achieve 
needed relief to eliminate a constraint.  This Adjust List sent out to 
Generation and Load Control Areas and Tag Authors for all transactions that 
are being recommended for curtailment.  It is intended to aid in coordination 
Control Area schedules during curtailment, as well as alert the marketplace 
of recommendations for their transactions to be curtailed. Under the current 
process, the Adjust List notice is sent out when the initiating Security 
Coordinator and all impacted Security Coordinators have agreed to recommend 
specific curtailments.  As such, this recommendation can occur very late, 
leaving very little time for the market to react (i.e., resource and/or 
resink their power).  

The Potential Adjust List feature adds a second, earlier Adjust List that is 
sent out when the initiating SC requests relief, but prior to the 
confirmation of all the impacting SCs.  This should allow this recommendation 
to be delivered several minutes sooner than it is today, giving more time for 
the market to begin searching for alternate economic sources and sinks.  When 
all impacted SCs confirm, the standard Adjust List recommendation is sent out 
as it is today.

It should be recognized that both the Potential Adjust List and the standard 
Adjust List do not represent actual curtailments - in both cases, they are 
only recommendations for curtailment.  Control Areas may elect to curtail 
different transactions or amounts than reflected in either Adjust List due to 
local relief procedures or other business practices.  However, both lists 
should aid in mitigating risk associated with physical transactions and 
curtailments.  Further, empirical evidence seems to indicate that in the 
majority of cases, the Potential Adjust List, standard Adjust List, and final 
curtailments will be very close.

This change is based a proposal I wrote with the help and support of Jim 
Eckelkamp (Carolina Power and Light), Mark Scheel (Dynegy), and Patt Terris 
(Exelon Power Team).   If you talk to any of them during the course of daily 
business, please thank them for their support of this effort.  With their 
assistance in developing the concept, ironing out the technical details, and 
cultivating NERC support in the various forums,  we were able to implement 
this change very quickly. 

I expect this change to take place sometime between June 15 and June 28.  
Attached, please find a message from NERC that describes the feature and how 
it works.  If you would like more detail, please let me know.  I currently 
Chair the group that is responsible for improving E-Tag, and as such, am 
intimately familiar with tagging and its functions.

In the next few weeks, I will be working with Don Baughman and Juan Hernandez 
to ensure we utilize this feature (and others) to maximize the value of our 
E-Tagging tools.  As indicated above, please feel free to contact me with any 
questions.

Some of these changes will affect Stack Manager while others affect the Website. A summary of these changes is listed below.

Stack Manager Changes

Top of Stack limit orders - This feature will allow the price submitted via limit orders to be displayed on the website if their bid or offer is better than the trader's stack price. Stack Manger will list the price and the names of counterparties submitting such orders on the  floated stack window.  Orders will be queued by price and time stamp. When a counterparty trades on a "" Top of Stack Entry"" it will create back to back transactions; one between Enron and the counterparty submitting the order, and the other between Enron and the counterparty clicking on the website.

In order to turn on this functionality select the "" Allowed Top of Stack"" option, in the Orders section of the product properties page.  If regular limit order functionality is desired the ""Allowed""  option should be selected.

Please note that this feature will be released in a disabled mode and will be turned on sometime next week after determining which business units want to roll this out.

Restricted Top of Stack limit orders - This feature will allow the price submitted only by internal traders via limit orders to be displayed on the website if their bid or offer is better than the trader's stack price. Stack Manger will list price and the names of counterparties submitting such orders on the  floated stack window.  Orders will be queued by price and time stamp. When a counterparty trades on a "" Top of Stack Entry"" it will create back to back transactions one between Enron and the counterparty submitting the order, and the other between Enron and the counterparty clicking on the website.

In order to turn on this functionality select the "" allowed as Restricted Top of Stack"" option, in the Orders section of the product properties page.  If regular limit order functionality is desired the ""Allowed""  option should be selected. If a product has active orders against it you will not be able to select the ""Restricted Top of Stack"" feature.

Advanced Filtering Ability on All Products Tab -  Drop down filtering capability is now available for each field in the All Products tab in stack manager. In order to filter click on the arrow next to the field title. A drop down box with a list of attributes will appear. Highlight the attribute by which you wish to filter. To turn off the filter click on the arrow and select the "" All"" option from the drop down box.


Website Changes

New Submission Screen for Restricted Top of Stack Limit Orders -  The submission screen for  products that allow  Top of Stack or Restricted Top of Stack limit orders is as follows.
 

The submit button on the left makes a submission for a normal transaction, while the button on the right will submit as a limit order.  In case of the Restricted Top of Stack limit orders only internal traders will see the new submission box. 

Price of Limit Orders 

Modify Limit Orders
 Customers now have the ability to modify the price of any active order. In order to do so highlight the order to be modified and use the plus or minus sign next to the price field on  at the top of the ""Today's Orders"" section. The price will move up or down in the same increments as the tick size for that product. Once the price is at the desired level click the ""Set"" button and the price will be modified. Another way to modify the price on a limit order is to click on the price field on a particular limit order.  You will see a box with plus, minus and set buttons that allow you to modify that order.

Expiration time for Limit Orders
Customers can now place limit orders with expiration times of up to 30 days. Currently they may place orders for only up to 12 hours.

Float the Today's Orders Section
You can now float the "" Limit Order "" section. In order to do so, right click in the ""Today's Orders "" section and select the float window option. In order to make the window "" Stay On Top "" right click on the floated window and select the stay on top option.

Mid Market Client - Mid market originators will now have the ability to transact on behalf of their customers, while including their desired margin on the trade, on EnronOnline products. In order to do so Click on the bid or offer price, a customised submission window will appear.  Select the counterparty for whom you wish to transact from a drop down list , enter the desired customer price and margin and click submit. For example if a customer wants to buy Nymex Sep 01 at 3.36 and you wish to have a 1 cent margin, please enter 3.36 as the desired price and 0.01 as the margin. The system will trade the order when the EnronOnline offer for Nymex Sep 01 is at 3.35, book the trade at 3.36 and record the 0.01 origination amount.

In order to be set up to use this functionality. Please call the EnronOnline Product Control Group.

Changes to Website Passwords - As an added security measure, which has been requested by many customers, some new password rules have been instituted. First, the password cannot be equal to the login ID. Second, each user will be prompted to change his password every 90 days. These rules apply to all website passwords for both internal and external users.


Please note  Stack Manager changes will be available all traders as of Monday August 20, 2001. The changes to the website will be rolled out to a few internal users on Monday with the rest of the internal users being upgraded Monday night, and external users by the end of the week.  Over the next couple of weeks all users will be prompted to change their website passwords.

If you have any questions regarding these changes please contact me at 713-853-1787.

,01/29/2002,,coo.jeff@enron.com,energy.dl-ga-all_ubsw@enron.com,,Management Changes,"With Ken Lay's resignation, you undoubtedly have questions about Enron's management structure and what lies ahead for the company.  The purpose of this communication is to begin to answer those questions and lay out the direction we plan to follow as we regroup and rebuild.

First, the Creditors Committee has proposed that the Board of Directors retain an interim CEO to focus on the restructuring process.  This is a positive sign that the Committee believes Enron will provide greater value as a viable ongoing business.

The Enron Board of Directors has approved Stephen Cooper as interim CEO and chief restructuring officer.  Steve is the managing partner of Zolfo Cooper, a corporate recovery and crisis management firm with more than 30 years experience leading companies through operational and financial reorganizations.

Steve and his firm will work with members of Enron's current management to develop and implement a comprehensive plan to restructure the company and emerge from bankruptcy.  

As you know, Enron has entered into an agreement with UBS Warburg for the sale of NetCo, Enron's wholesale gas and power trading organization.  In preparation for the transition of NetCo to UBS, Greg Whalley has resigned as president and COO of Enron to assume a position with UBS Warburg.  We want to thank Greg and the NetCo employees joining UBS for their contributions to Enron and wish them great success going forward.

In addition to engaging Steve, Enron has formed an Office of the Chief Executive.  I will join Steve in that office as president and chief operating officer, and Ray Bowen will join us as executive vice president and chief financial officer.

We will provide additional information regarding the roles and responsibilities of Enron's entire management team once those become more fully defined.

Thank you for continuing to support Enron by performing your job everyday.  The ongoing uncertainty about our future, coupled with the constant media scrutiny, makes this situation difficult for all of us. While no one can control the media, we can and will define our leadership and devise our strategy for moving ahead.  And in doing so, we will build a more certain future for our company and our employees.

,01/23/2002,,keith.holst@enron.com,"john.lavorato@enron.com, s..shively@enron.com",,Weather desk,"John,

This is my view on what may be possible:

Steve:	Issues:	1. Uncomfortable with UBS's committment to the business
		2. Surprised that no one from UBS has spoken directly with him
		3. Seems like he wants to build/run a team and is motivated by money.
		4. His interperetation of the contract is that even if this deal fails, his would be bound by a none compete until the end.

	Solution:  Money alone is not enough because does not address 1 and 2.  He needs someone (senior) from UBS to spend some time with him to:
		   (a) help him fell more comfortable with UBS's committment; (b) get him excited by the possiblity to lead/shape/direct the weather group
		   (this notion seemed to catch his interest during our discussion with him); (c) and present him with a new deal (no more of this aim for 80%
		   happy bullshit).  This new deal will need considerably less restrictive language--talk with Hunter about specifics.

Adam:	Issue:  1. Has interest in returing to the air force (his window to do so is until July 7th.)

	Solution:  Appears that money is not his first priority.  Any offer of money that precludes him from the July 7th window will be unsuccessful!
		   Our strategy needs to be one that gives him some respectable money that he can keep as long as he stays until June 1st (after he is
		   committed it may be possible to persuade him to stay longer).  He will not accept an offer that takes away his air force option!!!!!!  Also,
		   I think signing him will be alot easier once others have committed.

Jose:	Issue:	1. Recongnizes that senior management (You, Greg, and Louise) have done a good job closing the deal, but have failed to address HR
		    issues.  He thinks that this failure has existed much longer than just during the bankrupcy.  (Quoted, ""Mike had to fight way to hard
		    to get the very basic things for his team since day 1."")

	Solution:  The most difficult of the three to sell.  I think the ONLY hope would be for him to regain trust and respect for senior management. Senior
		   management would need to sitt with him and LISTEN to his issues!!!!

Mike:	Issues:   1. He wants out!!!!!!!!!!"
,01/23/2002,,sladana-anna.kulic@enron.com,john.lavorato@enron.com,,Analyst/Associate Program,"Dear Mr Lavorato,
 
I am writing you to express my dissapointment about how the whole A/A issue with UBS was handled. I have been working for a year as an Analyst in the Gas Risk Management Group. In that period I learned a lot  about risk and  trading, and eventhough sometimes we worked crazy hours, I thought I had this incredible job, and I  worked with the best people in the industry. How few of us get a chance like that?! I was looking forward to my next rotation in the origination group, when the whole Enron scandal started happening. 
 
Even when we filed the bankruptcy, I still knew that the trading group will survive, and I was right. But I never thought that the management will so easily forget about the analysts, and not even try to negotiate analysts salaries with UBS , that all of us knew were the lowest in the market. And I am completely sure, UBS knew that too, but why would they pay us more, when our own management did not stand behind us. I remember the times when I was working till 11:00 p.m  or sometimes even longer, but since I had this incredible group of people to work with, I always thought someone would recognize that. But it looks like that it does not matter anymore how much you work, but who do you know?!
 
Mr. Lavorato, I wanted to share this with you because I know that you can make  a difference and that you always cared about the A/A program. Eventhough it may be late for me, it would be a great loss for the company if all  these smart people start leaving. Many of them are the brightest individuals I ever met, and I think they are the future of UBS Trading Group. I hope that you will at least think about what I said, because I know that you have a lot on your mind. 
 
I wish you a lot of success in this year!
 
Sincerely,
Anna Kulic

,01/29/2002,,robert.johnston@enron.com,john.lavorato@enron.com,,Competitive Analysis,"Hi John- thanks for the generous offer which I have accepted.  A couple of outstanding questions- 

1. Who am I reporting to?  I would welcome the opportunity to report to you or Greg.  I think my job was a lot easier in the past because our group had the backing of the Office of the Chair. This gave us credibility, independence, and the chance to contribute to strategic issues as well as the tactical issues of interest to the traders. However, I am obviously open to any reporting relationship you might suggest and I understand that my day-to-day duties will consist largely of interaction with the Fundy teams.

2. Are there any slots that have opened because of offers that were not accepted?  I would love to be able to take one of the folks from my group with me, particularly Kristin Walsh or my assistant Sharon Purswell.

Thanks again for the great offer and the chance to join UBS.

Anyway, I have agreed to help organize the spring speakers for the Houston chapter of the Kellogg Alums and I am writing to ask if you would be available to make a presentation.  This would likely be a joint session with graduates of some of the other top b-schools.

,01/31/2002,,chris.gaskill@enron.com,s..shively@enron.com,john.lavorato@enron.com,IHS Meeting,"Hunter,

IHS
We met with IHS this morning to discuss the data that we need to complete our supply forecasts.  It is our intent to use the monthly historical production data in combination with well completion data, rig counts, and drilling permits to build a more accurate production forecast.  We need complete well characteristic data (depth, basin, age) in order to be accurate.  

In order to reach the goal above, we need to invest in two data services from IHS:

	US Production data - monthly volumes from all wells in the US updated on a lag of 1-6 months - $159,500/Yr. delivered on CD-ROM monthly
	US Well data - well characteristics updated monthly, data age is only limited by CD-ROM delivery - $154,000/Yr. delivered on CD-ROM monthly

Next year, we will be able to cut the US Well data and add Scout Express, which will cut the cost by $115,500.  Scout Express has only one year of historical well data, so it does not currently meet our needs.  We will be able to do this after we build the historical well information into our supply forecast.

Danielle Marcinkowski is working with IHS on the contract for the data, she is going to try and negotiate the price this afternoon.  She anticipated having the contract today, and sending it to Chicago for approval.

PIRA
Danielle is working to finalize the agreement in the next 3 days.  I gave her a list of the services that we needed, and told her that we would like to distribute the PIRA material on the Commodity Fundamentals website instead of having individual user accounts.  Based on the services that I think we'll need (North Americal Natural Gas, North American Electricity, and the Daily Demand Forecast), our combined cost for Gas and Power in Houston, Portland, Calgary, and Toronto should be around $100,000 for 100 users.  Danielle is going to send an e-mail when she has the final price.

Let me know if you have any questions.

,02/01/2002,,chris.gaskill@enron.com,s..shively@enron.com,john.lavorato@enron.com,David Woodstrom,"Hunter,

As I mentioned this morning, since Zach McCarroll turned down the offer we would like to explore the possibility of keeping David Woodstrom on the IT team to fill the open position.  The Fundamentals IT team has been cut to a minimum support staff, and the addition of David would facilitate more development of fundamentals content.  David has been focusing on the operational capacity reporting (morning ops reports) by creating better ways to access the operational data (real time query tool vs. standard reports).  David also has been responsible for maintenance and development of the commodity fundamentals website since he joined the group in early 2000.  He built and maintains the current message board system used by gas trading and as well as the critical notice alerts for pipelines.  He has also worked closely with the West desk and Portland on various real time load and outage reports.  David Dronet and I both feel that the addition of David Woodstrom will allow the fundamentals team to continue producing innovative products instead of providing only support for current operations.  Let me know if you have any questions.

The Royal Tenenbaums 
Gene Hackman, Gwyneth Paltrow 
Royal Tenenbaum had three children--all geniuses. And when this absentee father returns one winter, with an unexpected revelation, the Tenenbaums find that genius doesn't help any in reuniting a dysfunctional family. From Wes Anderson, the director of Bottle Rocket and Rushmore, The Royal Tenenbaums  is the hilarious story of a family of brilliant eccentrics--and how they got that way. Golden Globe
 nominee Gene Hackman stars, along with Anjelica Huston, Ben Stiller, Gwyneth Paltrow, Luke Wilson, Owen Wilson, and Bill Murray.

During the simulation, you will be able to use your normal, ""live"" Stack Manager User ID and password, which will be emailed to you separately.

The attached word document below provides a basic review on Accessing the Stack Manager.  You should manage the same products as you normally would, even if those products are not expected to be going live on our initial launch day. If you have products that need to be created, please contact Kevin Meredith (3-9555) or Chris Walker (3-7533) with UBSWenergy.com immediately.

Trading Goals - for all traders participating in the simulation.
Log into the stack manager on Wednesday afternoon and ensure that your products are ready to be activated on Thursday morning. We will send you a reminder on Wednesday to advise you of the time when the application will be available.
Start and end with a flat position
Make markets in your respective products
Maintain tight spreads in the products you manage

NON-UBS PERSONNEL WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SEE OR TRANSACT ON PRODUCTS DURING THE SIMULATION.

Internal Originators will be playing the roles of customers and will be hitting your stacks throughout the simulation.  You will also be able to trade book to book via the website with your website User ID and password which will also be emailed separately.

Market ""News"" events may be emailed to you at certain points throughout the simulation (e.g. ""storm in the gulf"").

Immediately after the simulation, the website will be inactivated, so that the operations group can test the mid/back-office systems, while the IT groups clean-up the transaction data from the simulation. 

The system will be made available again for live, internal trading (book to book) between traders on Friday, February 8, 2002. FRIDAY'S TRADES ARE FOR REAL.

If you can't log into any application on the day or are having trouble with your systems, please contact the UBSWenergy.com Help Desk immediately at 713.584.4444

Dear John Lavorato, Hunter Shively, Andy Lewis, and Chris Gaskill:

I regret to inform you that I will be resigning from the new Enron/UBS Warburg venture and will await further direction in the effort to fulfill my current obligations.  It is definitely with a bit of sadness that I have arrived at the conclusion to leave the new Enron/UBS Warburg venture, but I believe that it is in the best interest of my young career.  In addition, after signing a UBS offer letter I have realized over the last two days that given my current assignment it would be very difficult for me to continue to be motivated and to produce in the manner that would please both management and myself. Therefore I believe it is in the best interest of both parties that I leave the new Enron/UBS Warburg venture. Although this decision was not an easy one for me to make, I have decided to pursue other opportunities. 
I am extremely grateful for the opportunities I have been given here in this organization and for the investments that both you as individuals and the organization as a whole have made in my personal career development.  I believe I have worked hard at Enron and I trust that I made significant value adding contributions. It is because of my experience here and the tutelage that all of you have given me that I have my current knowledge and opportunities. I am very grateful for all of my experiences here at Enron/UBS Warburg, and I would like to personally thank all of you guys upon your return from Connecticut.  I will also make a concerted effort to maintain contact with all of you.
UBS Warburg Energy will certainly be a successful organization and I wish you all the best of luck with the exciting challenge of rebuilding this great business.
I await your direction upon receiving my intention to resign, and I offer my services in order to make the process as smooth as possible. 

Sincerely,
Denver Plachy"

,01/24/2002,,chairman.enron@enron.com,dl-ga-all_enron_worldwide1@enron.com,,Message from Ken Lay,"Earlier today, I stepped down as Enron's Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer.  This decision was reached in cooperation with Enron's Board and the Creditor Committee and is effective immediately.

To emerge from bankruptcy, Enron needs a CEO who can focus 100 percent of his or her efforts on rebuilding the company.  Unfortunately, with multiple inquiries and investigations that require my immediate attention, at this time I am unable to fully concentrate on what is most important to Enron's stakeholders - preserving value for our creditors and our dedicated employees.

The Creditor Committee has begun a search for a restructuring specialist to serve as interim CEO to help the company emerge from bankruptcy.  This individual will join Enron's remaining management team to direct the company's ongoing operations.

I truly believe Enron can and will survive.  I will remain a Director of the Board to help see that it does.

During my time at Enron, I have witnessed tremendous change and opportunity.  I have seen people rigorously grow and maintain one of the world's most efficient and safest gas pipeline networks; I have seen people dedicate themselves to a cause that became a passion - the opening of energy markets; I have observed smart people come together as a team to build creative solutions like EnronOnline; and I have watched people tirelessly give of themselves to help their fellow employees and those in the community.  Regardless of what has happened, I am proud of so much of what we were able to accomplish here.

Thank you for your contributions to the company and for the inspiration you have been to me over the years.

She stated that they are currently not expediting passports however she would send in a note requesting that it be sent to you ASAP.  She said that it is currently 20 business days to complete and send.  I did explain that this is urgent for your green card application (remember I also sent a letter with your application).  She said that she could not help.  I asked to speak with a Manager and that is when she sent a message expressing the urgency.

She did confirm that they have your passport information in their office.  I also sent to the necessary materials for them to overnight it back to you.

On Friday, January 11, trading of Enron stock was suspended on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).  All Savings and ESOP Plan transactions, including 401(k) payroll contributions,  involving this fund were placed in a pending status until trading resumed.

As announced by Enron's Office of the Chair on Wednesday, January 16, Enron stock would now be traded Over The Counter (OTC).  Upon receiving this information, work began immediately to develop a process that allows for OTC trades in the plans.

On Thursday, January 17, Enron initiated a process to facilitate OTC trades of Enron stock inside the 401(k) and ESOP and all pending transactions were processed using Thursday's closing price.  

Now that trading has resumed, we urge you to review your investment elections to ensure that they are consistent with your investment goals.

overcome, if you want to make it to the top. Veteran journalist Sam Donaldson 
offers this career advice: to succeed, you'll have to work at it one day at a 
time.

,12/12/2000,,darlene.forsyth@enron.com,darlene.forsyth@enron.com,,Could it be we're not paying attention?,"The man whispered, ""God speak to me"" and a meadowlark sang. But the man
did not hear. 

So the man yelled ""God speak to me"" And the thunder rolled across the sky.
But the man did not listen. 

The man looked around and said, ""God let me see you."" And a star shined
brightly, but the man did not notice. 

And the man shouted, ""God show me a miracle"" And a life was born.  But
the man did not know. 

So the man cried out in despair, ""Touch me God, and let me know you are
here"" Whereupon, God reached down and touched the man. But the man brushed
the butterfly away and walked on. 

Don't miss out on a blessing because it isn't packaged the way that you
expect.  So many times we see miracles and do not recognize them for what
they are. 

My instructions were to send this to four or more people that I wanted God
to bless and I picked you. Please pass this to people you want to be
blessed."

		Aerobic Exercising  
		
		While weightlifting builds muscles, aerobic exercises target your heart 
muscle. Great forms of aerobic exercise are bike riding, running, rowing, or 
brisk walking. Try performing aerobic exercises for at least 20 minutes a day 
a few days a week and you will quickly see how much better you feel! Be sure 
to talk to your doctor before you start any exercise regimen.

There was this Christian lady that had to do a lot of traveling for her
business, so she did a lot of flying. Flying made her nervous, so she
always took her Bible along with her to read and it helped relax her.

One time, she was sitting next to a man. When he saw her pull out her
Bible, he gave a little chuckle and went back to what he was doing. After
awhile, he turned to her and asked, ""You don't really believe all that stuff
in there do you?""

The lady replied, ""Of course I do. It is the Bible.""
He said, ""Well, what about that guy that was swallowed by that whale?""
She replied, ""Oh, Jonah. Yes, I believe that, it is in the Bible.""
He asked, ""Well, how do you suppose he survived all that time inside the
whale?""

The lady said, ""Well, I don't really know. I guess when I get to heaven, I
will ask him.""
""What if he isn't in heaven?"" the man asked sarcastically.
""Then you can ask him."" replied the lady.

		Internet Tip of the Day
		Monday December 11, 2000
		
		Northern Light Search  
		
		Northern Light differs from other search engines by grouping your results 
into folders that let you eliminate whole categories of false hits. You make 
your searches broad enough to be inclusive and then narrow it down by 
eliminating the sites and categories that you don't need. Researchers studied 
search engines to see how much of the Internet they cover. Northern Light hit 
some 16% of all Web pages. That sounds terrible until you realize that its 
nearest competitor hit less than half that many. Some of the most popular 
search engines on the Net only cover between one and four percent of all Web 
sites, a total that shrinks as more sites go online every day.

		Strains  
		
		A strain is an injury to a muscle or tendon (the fibrous band that connects a 
muscle to a bone). This can occur from improper movements or overuse. As with 
sprains, the pain and swelling that occurs with a strain may be relieved with 
rest, elevation, and cold compresses. Of course, see your physician before 
initiating any treatment.

	Once you've visited PatSajak.com, you can say you've seen everything. That's 
right - the riveting Wheel of Fortune host finally has his own site. We've 
all been waiting, sweating, biting our collective lip for this day to come 
and now it has arrived. So, you ask, what is the first thing I'm greeted with 
when I arrive? A Flash animation of Pat's smilin' mug. Click it once and 
you're in the middle of the challenging PatPuzzle, wherein you can rearrange 
the man's face (in the nice way). Then read Pat's newsletter which is 
chock-full of late-breaking headline news, a section dedicated to Pat's talk 
show (which is suspect, considering it lasted roughly 4 minutes on the air), 
find out how to make your big break by becoming a Wheel contestant, and learn 
about Pat's many many side projects. The web at its most compelling.

  Some people are only alive because
  it is illegal to shoot them

  I used to have a handle on life, but it broke.

  WANTED: Meaningful overnight relationship.

  You're just jealous because the voices
  only talk to ME.

  BEER: It's not just for breakfast anymore.

  So you're a feminist...Isn't that cute.

  I need someone real bad...
  Are you real bad?

  BEAUTY is in the eye of the beer holder.

  All men are idiots...
  and I married their king.

  The more you complain,
  the longer God makes you live.

  I(nternal) R(evenue) S(ervice):
  We've got what it takes
  to take what you've got.

  Hard work has a future payoff.
  Laziness pays off now.

  Reality is a crutch for people
  who can't handle drugs.

  Out of my mind...Back in five minutes.

  As long as there are tests,
  there will be prayer in public schools.

  Hang up and drive.

  I said ""NO"" to drugs,
  but they didn't listen.

  Your kid may be an Honor Student,
  but YOU'RE still an idiot.

  Smile, it's the second best thing you can do with your lips.

  I took an IQ test and the results were negative.

  Where there's a will...I want to be in it.

  It's lonely at the top, but you eat better.

  Don't drink and drive...
  You might hit a bump and spill your drink.

  Consciousness: That annoying time between naps.

  Ever stop to think, and forget to start again?

  Always remember you're unique...
  Just like everyone else.

  HONK
  If You Want To See My Finger

  Who lit the fuse on your tampon?

  I don't have a license to kill.
  I have a learner's permit.

  I wasn't born a bitch.
  Men like you made me this way.

  Keep honking while I reload.

  Taxation WITH representation isn't so hot, either!

  Who were the testers for
  Preparations A through G?

  Madness takes its toll.
  Please have exact change.

  5 days a week my body is a temple.
    The other two, it's an amusement park.

  EARTH FIRST!
  We'll stripmine the other planets later.

  If you drink, don't park.
  Accidents cause people.

  If you can read this
  I can hit my brakes and sue you.

  Save the whales!
  Trade them for valuable prizes.

  Whitewater is over
  when the First Lady sings.

  Jack Kevorkian for White House physician.

  My wife keeps complaining I never listen to her
  ...or something like that.

  Sure you can trust the government!
  Just ask an Indian!

  Alcohol and calculus don't mix.
  Never drink and derive.

  If we are what we eat,
  I'm cheap, fast, and easy.

  Stop repeat offenders.

	""Proof of Life"" opens around the country Friday and it had better be good 
because if it's not, it will only live in infamy as ""That Movie Where, During 
Filming, Meg Ryan Cheated On Dennis Quaid With Russell Crowe"" - and nobody 
wants that. The film's official Web site is cool stuff, highlighting all the 
things about kidnapping and ransom you never thought you'd need to know. It's 
actually a little harrowing, with statistics in red typeface flying across 
the screen like CNN coverage during wartime. Click on individual countries to 
learn about their ""K&R"" history, and then swing over to the typical goodies 
like trailer, soundtrack info, cast & crew, etc. Good-looking site for a 
movie starring a good-looking couple - just don't think about that part, 
though. www.proofoflife.com

		Ministrokes  
		
		A transient ischemic attack (TIA - also referred to as a ministroke) can 
cause the same symptoms as a stroke, but is usually short-lived and resolves 
on its own. However, a TIA is often a warning sign that a more serious 
medical event is pending. Therefore, you should call 911 immediately, even if 
symptoms resolve.

		Internet Tip of the Day
		Thursday December 7, 2000
		
		Safe Cable and DSL  
		
		One of the biggest problems with cable modems and DSL (and other '""always-on"" 
Internet options) is a static IP address (your computer's Internet address). 
With a dial-up service, your IP address changes each time you log on. With 
""always-on"" service, your IP address doesn't change, which can make it an 
inviting target for viruses and cybervandals. Lots of cable and DSL services 
have pretty good firewalls, software that prevents unauthorized access to 
your PC or network. If your ISP doesn't, you can add one yourself, but how do 
you know if you're protected? Steve Gibson has the answer. Gibson Research 
Corp (www.grc.com) specializes in computer security products and services. 
One great feature of his Web site is his ShieldsUP! Page, which probes your 
computer (harmlessly) and then tells you how vulnerable it is to attack and 
what you need to do to secure it. I was pleased to find that my PC is pretty 
secure from cyberattack, despite my cable modem.! If you need a firewall, 
Steve has all the info you need. Be smart -- check your system's 
vulnerability today.

Weather Group

Let,s give a big round of applause to the Weather Team!  Environmental 
Finance Magazine ranked the weather group #1 in Online Services and #1 Dealer 
in the United States and Europe.  Gary Taylor, manager in weather trading, 
comments, ""The ""Best Dealer"" award reflects our counterparties' appreciation 
for the significant effort we have made to drive the growth of our market by 
making two-sided markets where other companies are only willing to quote 
either a bid or an offer.  This award also reflects the innovative nature of 
everyone on our desk, and their ability to price non-standard structures for 
our customers.  It is truly a team award.  The ""Best Online Dealer"" award is 
simply another testament to the unparalleled success of EnronOnline.  By 
providing tight, two-way markets online, we have provided two critical 
elements to generate growth in our market: 1) an element of price discovery, 
and 2) a quick and easy way to transact.""

The Weather Risk Management group launched a new product this week:  Power 
Demand swaps.  These contracts use power demand as an index and allow power 
market participants (generators, btu distributors, marketers, etc...) to 
mitigate volumetric exposures.  The first contract the desk offered is for 
the PJM power pool.  On EnronOnline, weekly swaps are available and the desk 
has placed option contracts on this index in the broker market.  Inquiries 
regarding this product should be directed to Claudio Ribeiro (product 
manager) x37313, Gary Taylor x31511, or Valter Stoiani x36906.

Competitive Analysis and Business Controls
eSource, Enron's premier corporate-wide research group, launched their new 
intranet product, eSearch, on December 1, 2000.  eSource's team of 
specialized researchers have created a web site to bring information and 
research to every employee's desktop.  The eSearch web site offers many links 
to information resources, access to research databases, specialized searches, 
sites to purchase books, articles, and reports, and training.  Employees can 
use the web site to conduct their own research or as a vehicle to submit 
research requests.  eSource's researchers and industry specialists are 
available to all Enron business units to provide timely and cost efficient 
research, to work with individuals or groups to fulfill one time research 
requests, or to design ongoing, customized monitoring projects or news 
updates.

Enron Global Markets Fundamentals
EGM Fundamentals is quickly building a team of expert analysts and associates 
to work directly with traders and marketers.  The team is already busy 
analyzing various commodities and market situations.  For example, an 
initiative is underway to analyze current negative fractionation spreads in 
the market resulting from rising natural gas prices.  Web sites to host this 
analytical information are currently in development for all EGM commodities.  
These sites will provide research and analysis, weather, publications, and 
any other information that will assist in decision-making or identification 
of potential commercial opportunities.  For questions or requests regarding 
fundamental research, contact Jennifer Fraser at x34759.  For questions or 
suggestions regarding the web sites, contact Heather Purcell at x54057.

Austin Energy
Austin Energy and Enron Sandhill, L.L.C, a subsidiary of Enron North America 
broke ground November 29, 2000 for the construction of the Sand Hill Energy 
Center, a 180-megawatt peaking electrical generation facility.  Located in 
eastern Travis County, the Sand Hill Energy Center will be a natural gas 
fired facility that will operate primarily during peak demand periods.  The 
$93.7 million project will feature four 45-megawatt General Electric gas 
turbines and will be operational May 1, 2001.


NEWS FROM THE GLOBALFLASH

Coal
The London dry cargo seafreight team traded 1 million metric tonne of 
Capesize vessel swaps via EOL in one day, (Wednesday 28th November). The deal 
was created by combining OTC options and a physically related cash market 
deal.  This helps to bring our YTD EOL to just under 2.5 mln tonne.

Off-shore wind energy deal
Enron Wind has signed a power purchase agreement with Swedish energy company 
Graninge.  According to the agreement, Graninge will deliver electricity to 
consumers using Enron's wind power plants in southern Sweden.  Enron Wind's 
Utgrunden off-shore wind park, completed this year, will generate in the 
region of 38,000 megawatt hours of electricity, or enough for around 6,000 
average homes between the mainland and the island of Oland on the southeast 
tip of Sweden.  In an announcement this week, Graninge stated that it plans 
to market the power to consumers as 'green' energy.

Happy 1st Birthday EnronOnline!
This week saw EnronOnline celebrate its first birthday.  During the course of 
its first year, EnronOnline has passed a number of milestones including the 
addition of a range of new functionalities for customers on the site.  
EnronOnline has now come of age, having surpassed the $274 billion mark in 
notional value in November.  This represents a total of 478,695 transactions 
since the site was launched on 29 November 1999.

The first anniversary was marked by giving the media guest access to 
EnronOnline in Europe.  A team from Reuters was invited into Enron House to 
receive a full demonstration of EnronOnline and as of today will be able to 
quote in reports live prices from EnronOnline.  Other media outlets are being 
invited to obtain guest access during the coming weeks as the word of 
EnronOnline's success continues to spread...

Australia
Enron Australia continues to assist in the region in a supportive role.  
Elliott Katz worked on the GEM migration in Singapore last week with an IT 
team from London, Oslo and Singapore.  Approximately 40 users, including 
Traders, were migrated to Windows 2000 and the CORP domain.  This is an 
important step for the Asia Pacific region, as it brings the three biggest 
offices (Singapore, Sydney and Tokyo) into line with corporate standards for 
desktop computing.

Japan
E-Power, a JV between Enron and Japanese finance company Orix, has announced 
proposals for a 2000MW gas-fired power plant at Mutsu-Ogawara, an industrial 
area  in northern Japan.   A feasibility study will be undertaken to define 
how the project will go forward and this may include the development of an 
LNG terminal in the vicinity.  The nature of the permitting process is such 
that the plant would not begin operations for six to seven years.  This 
project is just one of several options that E-Power are working on in Japan.

,12/06/2000,,darlene.forsyth@enron.com,darlene.forsyth@enron.com,,Update from Stacey's Mother,"Hi!  I just thought I would give an update on Stacey.  She is doing 
great!!!!!!!!  She finally got to eat solids today!  Yes, she still has her 
trachea in, but when she is capped, she can eat and talk.  And believe me, 
she is making up for lost time with both of those.  She was so happy to eat 
today.  She had some finely chopped chicken, mashed potatoes and gravy, and 
macaroni and cheese.  She was elated!  It was really fun to watch her.  She 
is feeding herself but only with her left hand.  Her right arm is still 
messed up.  The bone has come loose from the socket at the shoulder and the 
muscles have stretched.   They are working on trying to get it back in 
shape.  She can move it sometimes, but is in pain almost all the time.  She 
is cussing and discussing many things.  She has decided that it is time to go 
home and gets pretty upset when she is told no (so what else is new?).  She 
will be going to the opthomologist next week - to his office.  I am so 
excited that she will actually get to go somewhere.  We will go in the 
hospital van so they can help with her wheelchair.  She is still seeing 
double in her left eye at times.  She said she was seeing two mommies today.  
I asked her if one of them was skinny.  She said ""No"".  I said ""then both are 
fat?"".  She said, ""They aren't fat, they're just overweight"".  She teases a 
lot and remembers most of what we ask.  Her short term memory isn't very 
good.  She has trouble remembering the nurses names but reads their name tag 
instead.  Yes, she can read some things but not everything.  Some names and 
words throw her off.  She doesn't remember the accident.  The doctor said she 
wouldn't remember the accident and probably wouldn't remember one to two 
months prior to the accident.  She is still having trouble remembering what 
month it is but can remember that it is the year 2000.  I bought her a cheap 
watch today and she is able to tell the time most of the time.  Her progress 
is wonderful and I am so excited watching her.  We don't think we'll be home 
for Christmas, but think it will be some time in January.  We are planning to 
have Christmas at the hospital.  I told her it doesn't matter where, just 
that we are together; she seem okay with that.
Well, I need to go to bed.  A chance to sleep on my own bed is a luxury.  I 
miss John beside me.  He is going to Corpus on Mon. and Wed. night when I am 
coming home.  We pass on the freeway and call each other on the phone.  One 
time we stopped at the same Exxon to get gas and necked at the gas pumps.  
I'm sure people were wondering about us.  I get to see him on the weekends, 
but I miss spending time with him and David.  Sharon is coming home on her 
days off and spending as much time with Stacey as she can.  She will be here 
over the Christmas and New Year holidays.  She is thinking about moving back 
home to be closer to Stacey but isn't sure about it yet.  
Please,  send me your phone number and address.  We can't find our address 
book and I stupidly erased everything in my mailbox last week.  My brain is 
turning into mush.
Hope to hear from you soon.  My love to all.  I miss you and love you much!

		Kid-Safe Browsing  
		
		Parents are right to be worried about their children seeing ""adult"" content 
on the Internet. Pornography is the biggest worry for most, but so are Nazi 
and hate group sites, sites advocating drugs, and online scams and frauds. 
Parents can take control of the Web in the home with the help of security 
software like Net Nanny. There are others, but Net Nanny is one of the most 
popular with parents. Net Nanny's filtering software blocks objectionable 
sites on your home PC. It can be configured a variety of ways. It ""limits 
access to material that parents deem inappropriate, prevents the threat of 
'Cyber Strangers,' and denies the misuse of personal information such as 
credit cards and phone numbers."" You can create customized lists for every 
family member, and you can check to see where users have been. Kids today are 
usually more skilled with computers than their parents. Parents have come to 
rely on Net Nanny and other products and services like it! to help them keep 
their kids away from inappropriate online content. If censorship is the 
answer, it should begin at home.

OFFICE ETIQUETTE FOR THE HOLIDAYS

This is one of those ""gray areas"" that a workplace manual doesn't cover: 
what's proper when it comes to celebrating the holidays at the office? Can 
you wear that sparkly sequins dress to the party? How can you be sure what's 
acceptable, and what's not? These are important questions, so here are some 
important answers: the dos and don'ts of celebrating the holidays at the 
office.

THE SHORT LIST: Top 10 Worst Reasons to Form a Team

1. The Pointy-Haired Boss thinks it would be useful. If it really would be 
useful the PHB wouldn't mention it.
- No really I work better alone

2. It's a one-person job...but we have five people who need something to do.
- K the Lowly Tech

3. To discuss how we can eliminate non-productive activities from our day. 
Let's meet every morning from 9:00 a.m. to noon.
- $1000 Bill Bert

4. Internet Inappropriate Use Committee.
- Yesthankyoudontmindifido-bert

5. So that an important decision can be bogged down for months, thereby 
covering the PHB's rear end when he jumps in to unilaterally make a terrible 
decision without any thought.
- Wait and hurry up.

		Internet Tip of the Day
		Tuesday December 5, 2000
		
		Attaching Files to E-Mail  
		
		Readers wrote in saying they thought attaching WAVs to e-mail was a great 
idea, but how do you do it? It's easy! First you have to save the WAV in a 
folder, which you can name ""My Sounds"" or ""WAV Files"" or ""Funny Noises."" 
Create the appropriate folder, and then save the sound file in it. To do 
that, go to the Web page, click on the file you want to save, and choose 
""Save this file to disk."" Navigate to your sound folder and click ""save."" 
When you're ready to attach it to an e-mail, open a new message and, in 
Outlook, choose Insert-File (or click the paper clip icon). In Netscape the 
attach button and the paper clip icon are on the same button -- other e-mail 
programs, like Eudora, have similar features. Just navigate to the folder 
with all your sounds in it, and click the one you want to add. You can't make 
it play automatically unless the recipient has their e-mail program set to 
open files automatically when they are received -- a bad idea beca! use of 
the virus risk. Remember, never open an attachment from a source you don't 
know and trust, even if it says it's a picture, sound, or text file -- clever 
viruses hide their true file extension. You open a seemingly harmless 
attachment, and you've got the virus. It's too late to be careful once your 
machine is destroyed!

		Mars, the Land o' Lakes
		New images may show sedimentary rocks on Mars that could have been formed by 
lakes in crater basins. Such rocks would be the best place to look for fossil 
evidence of life. The oldest known ancestor of humankind has been discovered 
in Africa. And a temporary imbalance in British cows' milk is leaving the 
country's lattes frothless. Also -- balky space station solar panel --

	When the planets align properly, two hot topics collide together to form a 
parodist's dream. The folks at Brunching have come up with a winner in ""Am I 
President or Not?"" - a play on the latest trend to sweep Webdom, AmIHotOrNot, 
and the endless InjunctionFest that our Presidential Election has turned 
into. Perfect to play with while taking a break from work or to forward to 
your friends to remind them that we still don't know who will be running the 
country next month. www.brunching.com/cgi/amipresidentornot

		All About Arteries  
		
		An artery is a blood vessel that carries blood away from the heart. Most 
arteries carry bright red, oxygen-rich blood to all parts of your body. There 
are two exceptions to this. The first is the pulmonary artery, which carries 
deoxygenated (oxygen-poor) blood from the heart to the lungs where the blood 
is able to pick up oxygen. The second is the umbilical artery, which carries 
deoxygenated blood from the fetus back toward the mother's heart.

		Is Laser Eye Surgery For You?
		If you're thinking about laser eye surgery, be sure you do your homework 
first. In other news: Emotional eaters do gain more weight during the 
holidays, but adding a touch of fat to veggies will make you eat more of 
them--and fewer high fat carbs, and doctors sometimes inadvertently offer 
false hope to the terminally ill.  Click  here to read more!

We are one @Enron

Effective Friday December 22, 2000, you will have a new Security Request 
Database:

In the past, Enron Corporate/North American users have used the Security 
Resource Request System (SRRS) lotus notes database for their security 
request needs including New Hire/Contractor/Temporary access and 
Terminations. In response to the business reorganization, the IT Security and 
Controls group is working to streamline Enron,s Security Request structure 
and create one single request database for all groups to use, eRequest, 
located at http://itcentral.enron.com/

Please click on the following link to retrieve the eRequest training guide:  

http://itcentral.enron.com/data/services/training/documentationurl/

A great deal of effort has been put into this project to eliminate any 
duplicate security requests in Enron's Global Enterprise.  When you attempt 
to access the SRRS through Lotus Notes on Dec. 22, you will find a link to 
the new eRequest system.  

If you have additional questions regarding your new security request or if 
you have any problems with the eRequest system, please contact Information 
Risk Management at 713.853-5536. 


Thank you

	Remember the Magic 8 Ball from your youth? Well, in keeping with the 
tradition of the rest of our lives being digitized in Web-chunks, you can now 
have a Magic 8 Ball shaken just for you on the Web. That's right - ask it a 
question and the 8 Ball shakes itself up and reflects an answer to you via a 
Webcam. The use of the Webcam and a bunch of other techno-babble is explained 
in excrutiating detail at the site but will make your head explode if you try 
and read it. Trust me - just stick to the questions. 8ball.federated.com

	At The Coma
	The woman's husband had been slipping in and out of a coma for several 
months, yet she had stayed by his bedside every single day. One day, when he 
came to, he motioned for her to come nearer. 
	
	As she sat by him, he whispered, eyes full of tears, ""You know what? You have 
been with me all through the bad times. When I got fired, you were there to 
support me. When my business failed, you were there. When I got shot, you 
were by my side. When we lost the house, you stayed right here. When my 
health started failing, you were still by my side. You know what?"" 
	
	""What dear?"" She gently asked, smiling as her heart began to fill with 
warmth. 
	
	""I think you're bad luck.""

,12/04/2000,,enron.announcements@enron.com,the.mailout@enron.com,,Pulse Survey Memo from the Office of the Chairman,"In October of this year, we asked you to participate in the &Pulse8 survey.  
Over 70% of you were willing to take the time to respond.  Thank you!  This 
is our highest response to an all Enron employee survey - ever.  

In exchange for your candid feedback, we want to provide you with an overview 
of the results for our company.

We realize that you and your management have been working hard to build on 
our strengths and improve in areas of concern for us.  The results reflect 
your substantial efforts.

As you can see from the chart below, thanks to the increased focus on these 
issues provided by the Vision & Values Task Force and your efforts to improve 
communications, we have made significant progress.  

Question	1999 % Positive	2000 % Positive
Employees are encouraged to challenge the status quo	42%	47%
Decisions are communicated well	41%	50%
Employees feel free to voice opinions openly	46%	55%
Enron does a good job of acting on suggestions of employees	45%	52%
Communication across departmental lines is good	30%	34%

Congratulations on your fine efforts.  Improvements in communications across 
the company should enable better performance from all of us.  However, as you 
know, our goal is to have 60% positive in most of these areas by 2001.  So 
our work is not over and these will continue to be areas of attention. 
(Complete survey results are attached for your review.)
 
We are also pleased to report that employees across Enron expressed 
satisfaction in the following areas:
 
Employee benefits ) 82% 
Supervisors/managers deal fairly with people ) 76%
Supervisors/managers encourage teamwork ) 73%
People are treated with respect and dignity ) 73%
Information from top management is credible ) 74%
People would recommend Enron as a good place to work ) 72%
The workload is reasonable ) 67%
People are committed to Enron as more than just a place to work ) 65%

All of these areas improved between one and five percentage points since the 
previous survey.  In fact, we improved in almost every area measured by the 
core survey questions.

the flow of legal technology across the business units, and (iii) achieve

 To this end, a legal policy group will be formed for EWS Legal, which will 
include Lance Schuler, Enron Americas; Mark Evans, Enron Europe; Mark Taylor, 
Enron Net Works; Alan Aronowitz, Enron Global Markets; Julia Murray, Enron

		Health & Fitness Tip of the Day
		Monday December 4, 2000
		
		Sprains  
		
		When a joint is stretched too far beyond the normal range of motion, but is 
not fractured or dislocated, a sprain of the ligament that connects the bones 
can occur. If this happens to you, see your doctor to make sure that the 
sprain is not serious. He or she will probably advise you to treat the 
injured area with rest, elevation, and cold compresses.

	Hollywood Hauntings is a creepy little venture dealing with celebrity 
hauntings, Hollywood ghosts and the like. Although the site is in its 
infancy, there's still plenty of juicy stuff here. Check out the great 
Hauntings section for some helpful cross- referencing - you can browse by 
celebrity involvement, haunted hotels, haunted houses, movie studios and 
curses. Confused by some of the terminology? Then click Glossary for a quick 
primer on terms like 'crisis apparition.' A great links section provides 
added entertainment and a horror movie review section is slowly getting off 
the ground, too. A strange topic, to be sure, but stories on James Dean's 
Porsche and Marilyn Monroe's stay at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel will make 
you want to sleep with the lights on. http://gothic.vei.net/hollywood

	One day inside the Cathedral of Pisa, Galileo Galilei watched a monk draw a 
large chandelier toward himself, light the candles and release it. In the 
chandelier's constant swinging motion Galileo saw the potential for keeping 
time. Although the first proper pendulum clock, created by Christian Huygens, 
was not constructed until after Galileo's death, it was his early theory that 
sparked the invention. For more, click here.

	Many believe the potato chip was born in 1853 in a restaurant in Saratoga 
Springs, N.Y. when a picky customer complained about the thickness of his 
fried potatoes. When the potatoes were returned to wise guy cook, George Crum 
he sliced some potatoes as thinly as possible, fried them and sent them back 
to the customer. To his surprise the man loved them. For more, click here.

	The Long Hack Veil
	Jennifer visited a psychic of some local repute. 
	
	In a dark and hazy room, peering into a crystal ball, the mystic delivered 
grave news: 
	
	""There's no easy way to say this, so I'll just be blunt - prepare yourself to 
be a widow. Your husband will die a violent and horrible death this year."" 
	
	Visibly shaken, Jennifer stared at the woman's lined face, then at the single 
flickering candle, then down at her hands. She took a few deep breaths to 
compose herself. 
	
	She simply had to know. She met the fortune teller's gaze, steadied her 
voice, and asked: 
	
	""Will I be acquitted?""

		Internet Tip of the Day
		Friday December 1, 2000
		
		The Internet's Integrated Future  
		
		We noted the growth of wireless Internet services and the rush for 
telecommunications, network, and entertainment companies to team up to offer 
wireless connections. It's just the tip of the integrated iceberg, however. 
Wireless Internet services delivered to your cell phone or other portable 
devices are just the beginning of digital integration. It's highly likely 
that eventually your telephone, cable TV, and Internet services will all come 
over the same wire (or even through the air). Federal rules freeing up 
competition in the telecommunications industry have fostered all kinds of new 
alliances. The technology is becoming more integrated, too -- Net phones, 
Internet telephony, and interactive digital cable TV are just three examples 
of where convergence is occurring. All this means new devices that are more 
compatible and capable than current technologies, deeper penetration of the 
Web in everyday life, and a further blurring of the lines betw! een work and 
play. The future is here, and it's pretty cool!

		Butterfly Ballots Are Flawed
		Florida voters claimed the controversial ""butterfly ballots"" used in the 
presidential election were confusing. A new Canadian study backs them up. A 
Japanese invention tests how tired people feel. New evidence suggests that 
life made the transition to land from the oceans a billion years earlier than 
thought. The Mississippi oil spill is the nation's worst since the Exxon 
Valdez. Also -- new respect for black Arctic explorer Matthew Henson -- Japan 
bans human cloning -- ""Most Distant Object"" closer than thought -- and 
""fat-proof"" mice could yield anti-obesity drug. Click  here to read more!

,11/30/2000,,darlene.forsyth@enron.com,darlene.forsyth@enron.com,,Thanksgiving thoughts forwarded from a friend,"I must admit, yesterday I was basically told, but not in these exact words, 
how ungrateful I  was.

You see, I am one of those very fortunate people who, until a few years ago, 
had perfect 20/20 vision.
As we who are over 40 very well know, you start to lose your ""good eyes"" and 
must resort to eye glasses or contacts.  Well, after several years of 
fighting with the glasses, losing them, sitting on them, etc., etc., I opted 
last year for a contact lense (i.e. one -- Mono Vision).  It has been trying 
as you have to get used to focusing with one eye for reading and the other 
for distance.  

I had a conversation with my eye doctor yesterday, wanting a miracle cure, 
you know, 20/20 vision in the form of, I don't know!!, a simple pair of 
contacts?  Or, Was I a candidate for surgery?  He said that we (former 
20/20's) were the worst when it came to contacts as we had the most difficult 
time accepting our perfect vision loss.  

Immediately, I was humbled....  ""Okay, okay, I hear you, I understand.""  
At least I CAN see with corrective lenses, so what if it is not perfect.  

As you read below, I really am much more blessed than the many, many, many 
people of the world...

I will never complain again (well... not for a few days anyway).  

Bless and be Blessed!!!"

		MP3s  
		
		Most everyone has heard of MP3s by now. The digital music files have thrown a 
virtual monkey wrench into the global music/recording/distribution network by 
letting users swap tunes through file-trading sites like the notorious 
Napster. Artists and record labels say that trading in copyrighted tunes is 
piracy, and they're right. Users say MP3 trading boosts bands' exposure and 
that most users only download tunes for personal use, and they're right, too. 
An equitable solution that allows online digital music distribution while 
protecting copyright will be reached -- there's too much money and too big a 
market not to reach an agreement. One UK market study found that most music 
buyers expect the MP3 to replace the CD in about five years. The genie is out 
of the bottle. Online music is the next big thing, and it'll be good for 
musicians, listeners and record companies, once a solution is found.

		Insoluble Fiber  
		
		Insoluble fiber is a type of carbohydrate that is found exclusively in plant 
products. It's the part of the plant that is not fully digested, thus adding 
bulk to feces. This promotes the movement of fecal material through the 
intestines, which promotes bowel regularity. Insoluble fiber can be found in 
fruits, vegetables, brown rice, wheat bran, popcorn, nuts, whole wheat, and 
many other plant-derived foods.

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

EGM Coal & Emissions
The November and December NYMEX market remains very tight.  Offers in the OTC 
market have climbed to the low $40s.  The highest reported trade for December 
was reported at $38.50.   The tightness should continue through the first 
half of the year  with the Martin County mine still shut down.  The rest of 
the year remains strong piggy backing off of the current spot market. 

Finally--Life beyond the 150 to 155 range--vintage year 2000 SO2 allowances 
broke out of this trading range this week.  The low trade was around $119.50 
and the last trade was around $120.50.  The sharp drop in prices was caused 
in large part by the news of Dominion Virginia Power settling the New Source 
Review lawsuit brought against it by the state of NY and the EPA Continuing 
rumors of further NSR related settlements will likely create continued 
volatility.  It is as yet unclear what the new price floor will be.

NOx has settled down a bit with last trade 2001 vintage of $675.

Principal Investments
Solo Energy Corporation, an Alameda, California based developer of Wireless 
Energy microturbine products to supply superior on-site energy service to

NEWS FROM THE GLOBALFLASH

EnronCredit.com
On Halloween, Enron Credit.com hit the City of London last Tuesday. As an 
original PR stunt, the EnronCredit.com team organized a Grim Reaper with two 
female vampires to distribute candy carrying the message, ""Corporate 
bankruptcies are on the increase and could be your worst nightmare. You can 
protect your company and sleep well at night"". Locations for the distribution 
of 5,000 packs of candy were Bank, Broadgate and Canary Wharf. The general 
feedback and reaction of people was positive. Photos of the event will be 
available on the EnronCredit.com site.

Enron Japan Corp.
Enron is powering ahead in Japan following the official launch of Enron Japan 
Corp. in Tokyo last week.  In keeping with Japanese tradition, Ken Lay, Joe 
Hirl, Ken Rice and Mike McConnell donned ""happi coats"" - a sort of short 
kimono - and used ceremonial hammers to break the lid of a wooden cask of 
sake in front of an audience of 350 drawn from major companies and 
government.  Enron has made an immediate impact already by offering eligible 
consumers 3-5 year contracts with immediate savings of up to 10 percent in 
the first year.   View the Japan website at www.enron.co.jp  [No worries, 
it's in Japanese and English ...Ed]

There are 35 Enron employees in the Tokyo office including an Enron Metals 
team.  EBS will be staffing up there over the coming months.  


Nordic energy agreement with UPM-Kymmene
Enron Nordic Energy and UPM-Kymmene Corp. have signed a two-year portfolio 
management agreement covering UPM Kymmene's Nordic power portfolio. The 
Mid-Market desk in the Oslo office will assist UPM in optimising its 
portfolio of approximately 14 TWh. energydesk.com will provide UPM with the 
risk management system used in the process. In addition, the agreement opens 
the door for Enron Energy Services to explore a variety of opportunities 
within the company. The Nordic agreement is the first step towards a broader 
scope of co-operation with UPM on a European and Global basis. The total 
contract value is estimated to be $375 million.

UPM-Kymmene's nominal electricity resources total about 3000 MW, of which 
2500 MW in Finland and about 500 MW in other countries. The group's power 
procurement totals approximately 18 TWh per year, of which about 14 TWh in 
Finland. Around 15 TWh/a is consumed by the group's own mills and the rest is 
sold to the market.

this transaction into place........Thor Lien.

Australia
Despite heavy flooding in NSW, the weather is looking up for Enron 
Australia.  Last week, the Sydney Office launched online Hong Kong weather 
derivatives  and the Sydney weather node traded on EnronOnline in the US time 
zone.  With this precedent, we hope to support the takeoff of global weather 
on EnronOnline.  

The Coal Group in Sydney has suddenly become very popular. There is no doubt 
that a recent sale to AES for the plant at Barbers Point, Hawaii is the real 
reason.  Coal purchases during year 2000 have been concluded with most major 
producers in Indonesia and Australia.  We will soon be loading our first 
shipment from China. Deliveries to Nippon Steel in Japan are underway. Also, 
a shipment to a large power utility in Japan will take place in early 2001.

Off-shore wind plans
Enron has entered into agreement to purchase the development assets of a 30 
MW offshore wind project in the UK.  The Harwich project, situated in 
Gunfleet Sands approximately eight kilometres offshore in the North Thames 
Estuary is believed to represent one of the first serious investments in the 
development of offshore wind energy in the UK.

shortly.

Hello all.  My husband and I just returned from a trip to the Alsace region
of France over the Thanksgiving holiday and I thought I would pass on a
little something that applies to the Christmas season I learned.

Alsace lies at the It seems the tradition of decorating a tree for Christmas
began in this area (if there were no borders it would be part of the Black
Forest region of Germany).  The Alsacians are a generous, hardworking,
loving people as a whole.  Many wonderful people have come from this region.
One of the greatest is Dr. Albert Schweitzer.  Dr. Schweitzer began as a
master organist, built them actually and wrote books about them.  Then, he
felt called to the ministry and was a pastor with a compassionate heart.  He
was in Paris at a missions conference and was moved to hear of the tribes in
Africa, lost, without hope, practically no medical care and felt the Holy
Spirit move in his life once again.  He studied medicine and he, his wife
and a team of compassionate men and women moved to Gabon on the West Coast
of Africa and opened a hospital.  There, they cared for the sick in body and
spirit.

The tradition of the Christmas tree began in the early 1500's.  There was a
pastor who was coming home in the early winter evening having visited a
parishioner.  It was nearing the time of celebrating the Birth of Jesus.  As
he made his way through the dark woods, he came upon a fir tree bathed in
light.  It seemed a star sat upon the top of the tree.  The sight held such
wonder that he wanted to share it with his family.  Then, he began to see
the true story and felt that maybe it was not just coincidence that he
happened up that sight.  He cut the tree and began to dress it up in red
with white candles for his church and here is what he told the people (in my
words of course):

The tree is to remind us why Jesus came.  He came to die upon the tree for
our freedom.  The evergreen represents life even when death is all around
(all the other trees loose their leaves and ""die"") but only the evergreen
goes against the flow.  Its life flows from deep within.  The life of the
Christian flows from deep within.  So, the tree represents life.

The red ribbons and bow represent His Blood shed for us.  The scarlet ribbon
that covers the tree as His Blood that covers our sins.

The white candles represent (1) purity - we are cleansed and made pure
through the shed blood upon the tree, and (2) Light - that Jesus is the
Light of the World and the light on the tree is the Light on our lives.  He
said WE are the light of the world when we allow Him to live in us.

As time passed, all kinds of things have been added and the REAL purpose of
the tree has been forgotten.  One more VERY important thing that is added to
a European tree is the manger.  It is set up under the tree in the center
with a place of prominence.  Usually, the Christ Child is not added until
Christmas morning.  The tree in Europe is left in place until January when
the Three Wise Men came from the east to worship the King and this is when
gifts are usually exchanged.

While I love the giving (and the getting!) and the gathering and the eating
all the fun things that go with Christmas as much as the next person and
maybe more than some, I would like to encourage us all as we enter the
season.  If you have an artificial or real tree, a ""color theme"" or mix and
match, as you set the tree, remember Who died on a tree for you and your
home.  Let it represent in your home His sacrifice on the bare tree.  Let's
pray for the opportunity to witness in a different way to our unsaved
friends and family.  If you have a tree in your home this year, and you have
unsaved family, as you decorate it, each time you admire it, pray

""Father, let this tree represent You in this home.  Let Your Light shine
through me.  Let me share Your gifts You have given me with those You place
in my path.  As I wrap each present, I pray Your anointing goes with that
gift.  Let the sweater, the scarf, the article of clothes represent Your
covering over that loved one.  Let that toy bring joy to that child and open
a way for me to minister in a fresh way to that young heart.  Each time the
keyboard on that computer is touched, as I touch it, Lord, I know Your
Spirit linger there as it did for Elijah on that bed and the child was
raised.  I want Your resurrection power to flow through me to each person
You have given me to care for.  As I hang ornaments on the tree, let each
one represent a habit, a fear, a concern, a pain, a past unforgiven, a
sickness, a financial burden, a child, a husband, a wife, a future unknown
and uncertain, and the act of hanging be an act of faith of hanging it on
the cross.  An act of placing that care in Your capable Hands.  As the
lights are strung on the tree and home, let Your light shine through me.
Let my home be a beacon of Your Love in a dark, hurting, crying, sighing,
dying world.  As I meet with friends and family and reach out to hug, let my
arms be Your Arms reaching out in love.  Use me, mold me, make me what I
ought to be so I can be more like You.  In Jesus' Name...Amen!""

Just a thought I wanted to share.  We have a chance to make a real
difference in our homes as we allow Jesus to make a difference in our
hearts.

I love you all....Carol Word"

		Internet Tip of the Day
		Wednesday November 29, 2000
		
		The Wireless Future  
		
		The wireless Internet is the big buzz these days. It's here, but it's not 
ready for prime time. Most wireless Internet services deliver an abbreviated 
Web experience -- all text, for instance, or special low-graphics Web pages. 
It's expensive, too. Most wireless Internet devices are Net-capaable cell 
phones and PDAs, though more and more laptops and palmtops are offering 
wireless modems. Wireless is still for road warriors and others who need it 
at this point, but not for long. Telephone carriers, cell companies, and ISPs 
are teaming up to make wireless Internet service cheaper and more common. 
Some even foresee an entirely wireless future. You'll be able to surf the Net 
wherever you are, and make phone calls, too. As bandwidth grows, you'll even 
get television and other multimedia entertainment over wireless devices. 
Displays will get larger and brighter, batteries more efficient, and wireless 
pipes fatter (can you still call it a ""pipe"" when it comes through the air?). 
It's all going to happen, and sooner than you think.

		Are You Listening?
		Science confirms what most women already know -- men only use half their 
brain when listening, while women use both halves. A 200-year record of daily 
solar observations inndicates the Sun may have more to do with global warming 
than thought. Catalytic converters create one kind of pollutant even as they 
reduce another. Also -- Scientists find brain's ""funny bone"" -- Ensuring the 
safety of aging nukes -- Artificial photsynthesis -- And why the food that's

		Internet Tip of the Day
		Tuesday November 28, 2000
		
		Don't Forget to WAV!  
		
		One of the coolest things about e-mail is the way you can attach stuff. I'm 
talking pictures, Web addresses, and sound files that help you make your 
point -- typically humorous. Sounds can be sent as MP3s, MIDIs and other 
files, but most are sent as WAVs (""waves""), the .wav file eextension. They're 
bigger and bulkier than MP3s, but they're fine for most brief sound clips, 
and they're the Windows default sound file so you know your recipient will 
hear it -- assuming they have sound on their PC. Most folks do these days, so 
sending a digital raspberry or hallo or belch or whatever can really perk up 
your communiqu,. I'm a big Simpsons fan, and there has never been a source of 
brief, pithy and hilarious clips like Homer. This site has all the ""Do'hs!,"" 
""Woo-hoos!"" and ""Mmmmmmmm ... s"" you could desire, along with other Homerisms 
and quotes and clips from other Simpsons characters. The site has other sound 
clips, too -- just check out the navigation bar to the left!

,11/27/2000,,darlene.forsyth@enron.com,darlene.forsyth@enron.com,,Stacey Update,"Happy belated Thanksgiving, everyone.
 
I am sorry to have taken so long to send you this Stacey report. I was down 
in Corpus this past Tuesday and Wednesday and then up to Huntsville for 
Thanksgiving with my folks, and just returned home this afternoon (Saturday).
 
Stacey is OUT of the comma!!!!!!! She emerged from it last Sunday. Needless 
to say, Carolyn and John are just beside themselves. While I was with them on 
Wed. morning, I was able to watch Stacey in her rehab and got to see her 
write her name with her left hand. She also, just before I arrived, said 
""Momma"".  Guess What? I have really seem firsthand the miracle that we have 
all been praying for. 
 
I must admit that I was somewhat teary-eyed watching this precious little 
girl do things that no one was sure that she would ever do again.  But, there 
is still a long way to go.
 
Stacey's right arm is just kind of hanging from muscle atrophy. And, it is 
giving her a lot of pain. (The good thing is that now she can tell the 
doctors where the pain is located!) Also, it is going to take several more 
months of rehab before she can go home. So, keep the prayers going.
 
As I entered the room, there was a man there who was leaving. Last December, 
he was in an accident that left him in the same shape as Stacey. But now, he 
is fully recovered. He came to the hospital because he had seen an article in 
the Corpus Christi newspaper about Stacey. He said that he felt that he just 
needed to let the family know that there really is hope and that you really 
can fully recover. WOW! Does God have a sense of timing or what?
 
Carolyn wants everyone to know how much she loves you all and appreciates 
your concern and your prayers. The hospital let them use a large room for 
Thanksgiving Day dinner. They were even going to let Stacey have some of the 
food with them. Talk about a Thanksgiving?
 
Folks, I must tell you that this has been exciting for me to see this miracle 
unfold. I have enjoyed hearing from Carolyn and being able to report these 
things to all of you. I wish that all of you could get to go and see these 
people that we have all prayed for these past few months. It has been quite 
an emotional deal for me to have seen a child that no one was sure would even 
live and now see her awake and recognizing people around her and laughing and 
crying and writing her name. Thanks for what you have done for her through 
your prayers. And thanks for allowing me to send you these updates and to be 
your eyes and ears. But, as I said earlier, we don't stop here. It's not over 
until Stacey is 100%, and she will be! I will stay in touch with Carolyn and 
keep you updated.
 
We do have much to be thankful for this year.  So, let's thank Him who is the 
giver of all the good and perfect gifts, even life itself!
 
Be Blessed!
Kent"

		Internet Tip of the Day
		Monday November 27, 2000
		
		For More Information ...   
		
		For years now, public TV and other education-oriented broadcasters, like the 
History Channel and Discovery Channel, have given their viewers Web addresses 
where they can go to get more information on the program's topic. This is a 
great idea, and not just because it'll help you get your homework done. If 
you're inclined to watch ""educational"" TV in the first place, you probably 
need no coaching to pursue topics you find interesting. These sites are great 
places to start. They often list links and other resources. They're also 
great for the morning after, when you're discussing what you watched last 
night with your friends and co-workers. If you can't remember a certain 
thing, or if anything is in dispute, a quick click or two will take care of 
things. After all, the Internet is the ultimate argument-solver.

		E.T. May Be Here
		Scientists thought we'd have to go to Mars or further to find 
extraterrestrial life, but the answer may be in our own backyard, 
cosmologically speaking -- microbes found in the upper atmosphere may be from 
outer space. If so, it could bolster the ""panspermia"" idea that life camme to 
Earth from space, possibly via comet. In other news, seeds buried by a 
botanist 121 years ago have sprouted. The climate treaty talks appear doomed.

		Health & Fitness Tip of the Day
		Monday November 27, 2000
		
		Stroke  
		
		A stroke occurs when a part of your brain loses blood flow. This can occur 
from a blockage of a blood vessel or a bleeding vessel in the brain. Symptoms 
are varied and usually start abruptly. They can include, but are not limited 
to, sudden numbness or weakness, difficulty speaking, a decrease or loss in 
vision, headache, difficulty walking, or dizziness. Often the symptoms affect 
only one side of the body. Prompt treatment may be able to prevent permanent 
damage. It is therefore extremely important to call 911 immediately, even if 
the symptoms have resolved.

	Did you ever wonder why one's retirement savings plan is called a 401(k)? 
With the creation of the Tax Reform Act of 1978, section 401, paragraph (k) 
of the Internal Revenue Code was developed. Under this section, Congress 
authorized the creation of a tax-deferred savings plan for employees. For

little about the holiday you're celebrating today at Plimoth.org. If the

		Internet Tip of the Day
		Friday November 24, 2000
		
		Renaming Favorites and Bookmarks  
		
		It's a good idea to save your favorite sites in your Favorites (Internet 
Explorer) or Bookmarks (Netscape) files. Sometimes the name of the 
favorite/bookmark isn't what you want, however -- it might be blank, or in a 
foreign language (like Japanese), or maybe it just says ""index"" or something; 
or ""welcome to BlaahBlah.net, the blah-blahest site on the Net."" It's easy to 
give it an easier-to-handle handle. In Favorites, just open Organize 
Favorites. Your rename button is there with other useful buttons for 
organizing your bookmarks. In Netscape Bookmarks, just open Edit Bookmarks. 
Highlight the bookmark you want to rename. Right-click to bring up the pop-up 
menu, and select Properties. Just type the new name in the Name box, and then 
click OK.

	Some of the best Websites are created by The People Who Have Too Much Free 
Time - and if someone recreating over 180 scenes from the Star Wars Trilogy 
entirely out of Lego blocks isn't a sign of someone who's got too much free 
time, then I don't know what is. That's right, a scary individual who most 
likely lives in a basement somewhere has spent a jaw-dropping 2,600 hours 
recreating Star Wars in Lego format and has put it all on a Web site for the 
geek in all of us to check out. Warped and strange? Probably. Creative and 
interesting? Definitely. http://www5b.biglobe.ne.jp/~mbsf

	Chai is the word for tea in many parts of the world. India's take on chai is 
gaining popularity in the U.S. and has found a home on the menu at Starbucks 
and other coffee houses. It is a spiced milk tea containing rich black tea, 
heavy milk, a combination of various spices and a sweetener. The spices used 
can vary but are usually cardamom, cinnamon, ginger, cloves and pepper. For

	Phone Phun
	There was this phone company that was going hire one of two teams of 
telephone pole installers and it was up to the boss to choose. 
	
	So the boss said to both teams, ""Here's what we'll do. Each team will be 
installing poles out on the new road. The team that installs the most poles 
gets the job."" Both teams headed right out. At end of shift, one team came 
back and the boss asked them how many they had installed and they said  
they'd put 12 in. Forty-five minutes later, the other team came back in and 
they were dragging. The boss said, ""Well, how many poles did you guys 
install?"" The team leader wiped his brow and sighed, ""We got three in."" 
	
	The boss gasped, ""Three? Those other guys put 12 in!"" 
	
	""Yeah,"" said the leader, ""But you should see how much they left sticking 
out!""

and organizations devoted to certain software. This is especially true of 
large, complex programs used by professionals, like Photoshop, CAD modeling 
software, and financial or business tools. Experienced users have lots of 
tricks and shortcuts to share, and you can get quick answers to your 
questions. Some users maintain Web sites for their advice and tutorials. 
Developers sometimes post utilities, plug-ins and other extras that can make 
your life easier. If you're trying to come to grips with some powerful but 
complex software, open your favorite search engine and do a quick check. 
You'll be on your way to becoming the expert yourself.

Weather Group
On Wednesday, December 6th, The Weather Channel aired an episode of their 
show ""Atmospheres,"" which included a fifteen minute segment focusing on 
Enron's Weather Risk Management business.  Mark Tawney, Steven Vu, Gary 
Taylor, and Steve Bennett were featured.  The Weather Channel has aired the 
episode periodically since then.  The parts that make it through the Enron 
cutting room floor will be coming soon to an elevator near you!  If you would 
like to view a copy of the episode in its entirety, please contact Yvette 
Simpson at ext. 3-9595.

The Weather Risk Management group completed the first ever Power Demand 
transaction this week.  The transaction was a swap based on the PJM demand 
index.  Power Demand contracts use average peak power demand as an index and 
allow power market participants (generators, btu distributors, marketers, 
etc...) to mitigate volumetric exposures.  Weekly swaps are available on 
EnronOnline and the desk has placed option contracts on this index in the 
broker market.  Inquiries regarding this product should be directed to 
Claudio Ribeiro, product manager ext. 3-7313, Gary Taylor ext. 3-1511, or 
Valter Stoiani ext. 3-6906.

West Power Trading
It,s been a wild and crazy holiday season in the West.  Electricity prices 
have remained extremely bullish throughout the entire WSCC, due in large part 
to below-normal temperatures, &less than stellar8 river flows in the 
Northwest and Northern California, tremendously volatile natural gas prices, 
and a number of generating plants down for both planned and unplanned 
maintenance.  Recently, the Federal Regulatory Energy Commission (FERC) has 
stepped in to implement several orders in an effort to try to correct this 
&extremely flawed market.8  Stay tuned sports fans; some have the feeling 
that the best is yet to come.


HAPPY HOLIDAYS
Seasons Greetings from ENA PR.  The EnTouch newsletter will be on holiday 
break next week.  If you have information for future issues of EnTouch, 
please send it to Michelle Vitrella.  We hope you have a wonderful and safe 
holiday.  See you next year!

		Air Traffic Control System Command Center  
		
		The Internet has been the biggest boon to travelers since the invention of 
the suitcase. Lots of people use it to find the cheapest air fares and room 
rates, or to plan itineraries. Used to be it was hard to find out if a flight 
was delayed. Now it's as easy as a click with the FAA Air Traffic Control 
System Command Center's Real-time Airport Status Page. That's a long name for 
a handy site that gives your real-time delay information for major US 
airports. There's also a handy glossary of air traffic control terms. 
Bookmark it now so you won't have to search for it when you need it.

		Carpal Tunnel Syndrome  
		
		Carpal tunnel syndrome is a term for an overuse injury of the nerve that runs 
through the ""carpal tunnel,"" a sheath in the wrist area. This syndrome 
usually occurs when the wrist is overused, such as with repetitive work and 
while typing. Pain, numbness, tingling, and weakness of the wrist and hand 
can all be symptoms of this condition. If you have any of these symptoms, see 
your physician.

,11/21/2000,,enron.announcements@enron.com,all.downtown@enron.com,,Holiday Safety Reminder,"HOLIDAY SAFETY REMINDER

The holiday season can mean an increased risk of fires and a higher potential 
for criminal activity due to people taking advantage of convenient downtown 
shopping and because of the increased number of special events and office 
parties.  We would like to pass along a few safety and security tips from the 
City of Houston Fire Department and the Houston Police Department.

? Please do not prop open stairwell doors or doors to the freight elevators.  
This defeats security. 

? Use only artificial trees and greenery in decorating your office space. Do 
not place cut trees or greenery within the building. Cut trees become major 
fire hazards when they dry out.

? Office parties or the holiday mood may distract you.  Be alert for thieves 
who try to take advantage of the holiday season. Sometimes just having fewer 
people at work during the holidays creates an opening for thieves. If you see 
someone that does not appear to belong in your work area, immediately call 
the Enron Security Console at 713-853-5360.

? Keep your purse or wallet with you at all times or locked away in a drawer 
or closet.

? If you go shopping, invite a friend to go along. Try not to overload 
yourself with packages.  When you return, lock your gifts away in a safe 
place.

? Always be aware of your surroundings while in a public area. If things don,
t look right, follow your instincts and avoid going into the area.

? When waiting for a ride home after hours, remain inside the building near a 
card-reader door until you see your ride arrive. 

? If office parties are on company premises and involve alcoholic beverages 
or public invitees, call security at 713-853-5360.  Security will advise you 
as to company guidelines."

2000.  Some of the more notable accomplishments include:
a) 100% plus increase in EBIT from 1999 actuals to 2000 forecast;
b) significant rationalization of the balance sheet including the sale of the 
(i) Wind River/Powder River gathering assets, (ii) East Coast Power 
generating assets, (iii) HPL and (iv) five of the six Eastern Peakers;
c) ENA is the leading energy merchant by a factor of two;
d) physical electricity volume grew by 34% YTD 1999 to YTD 2000 forecast;
e) natural gas volumes grew by 82% YTD 1999 to YTD 2000 forecast;
f) 500% growth in daily transactions from November 1999 to November 2000 due 
to the highly successful Enron OnLine distribution channel; and
g) ENA reaching its 25% ROCE target.

These are truly outstanding accomplishments and our expectations for growth 
and opportunity in Enron North America for 2001 are consistent with that 
success.  In order to reach these goals, we felt it necessary to re-align a 
number of our organizations. A number of these changes are completed.  The 
goals of such re-alignment include:
a) increase overall productivity with the goal to ensure that every employee 
is in a position to contribute regardless of skill set;
b) increase overall market coverage, deal flow and information generation 
with the goal to increase bid/offer income, increase the velocity of deal 
flow, improve customer coverage and promote quality information transfer to 
our trading organization;
c) increase deal quality and earnings quality with the goal to (i) allocate 
our resources towards the best transactions and (ii) significantly increase 
our &mid-market8 originated transactions in our portfolio;
d) promote real time decision making and a closer tie between our trading and 
origination (mid-market and structured) organizations in order to better 
align those functions to reduce the amount of un-productive internal focus;
e) increase the overall velocity of the capital being utilized consistent 
with our goal of a 25% plus return on capital employed; and
f) identify and recognize a host of new leaders in the organization that are 
critical to meeting our goals next year.

With these objectives in mind, patterned after the successful business models 
in Calgary and Portland, effective immediately the following changes are 
being implemented:
a) East Power ) a single East Power Team incorporating trading, mid-market 
and origination will be formed under the co-leadership of Kevin Presto and 
Janet Dietrich who will report to the Enron Americas - Office of the Chairman 
(EA OOC).  This team will have one income statement, one book and a joint 
accountability. However, a clear delineation of responsibilities inside these 
teams will continue to exist in which the trading organization will manage 
the risk, income statement and product development aspects of the 
partnership. The originators will have the primary responsibility to generate 
origination income, provide coverage, deal flow, lead strategy formulation, 
provide information and generate strategic positions.  Overall, the team will 
be rewarded based upon increasing the value of the book, meeting 
coverage/deal flow targets and meeting its strategic/growth goals in the 
Eastern power markets. The team will be responsible for covering the IOU,s, 
muni,s/co-ops, industrials and IPP,s and will utilize all ENA,s product 
capabilities including the power commodity, assets and capital. The team will 
further be broken down into several key strategic regions and business units 
including: 
  (i) ERCOT ) managed by Doug Gilbert Smith and Bruce Sukaly;
  (ii) NE ) managed by Dana Davis and Jeff Ader;
  (iii) Midwest ) managed by Fletch Sturm and Ed Baughman;
  (iv) SE ) managed by Rogers Herndon and Ozzie Pagan;
  (v) East Power Development ) managed by Ben Jacoby;
  (vi) East Power Structuring  - managed by Bernie Aucoin; and
  (vii) East Power Fundamentals and the &Genco8 ) managed by Lloyd Will
   
b) West Power ) there will be no changes to the Portland office which is 
managed by Tim Belden and Chris Calger .  Both Tim and Chris will continue to 
report to the EA OOC.
c) Canada and Mexico ) there will be no changes to the Canadian or Mexican 
offices which are managed by Rob Milnthorp and Max Yzaguirre respectively.  
Both Rob and Max will continue to report to the EA OOC.
d) U.S. Natural Gas ) there are several changes anticipated in this business 
consistent with the goals and objectives described above. The changes 
primarily affect the East, Central, West and Texas gas regions. Each region 
will consist of a single gas team incorporating trading, mid-market and 
origination. Each team will have one income statement, one book and a joint 
accountability. However, a clear delineation of responsibilities inside these 
teams will continue to exist in which the trading organization will manage 
the risk, income statement and product development aspects of the 
partnership. The originators will have the primary responsibility to generate 
origination income, provide coverage, deal flow, lead strategy formulation, 
provide information and generate strategic positions. Overall, the team will 
be rewarded based upon increasing the value of the book, meeting 
coverage/deal flow targets and meeting its strategic/growth goals in the 
Eastern, Western, Central and Texas gas markets.  The team will be 
responsible for covering the LDC,s, muni,s/co-ops, industrials, IOU,s, IPP,s 
and the producers.  There will be an increasing focus on the upstream side of 
the business including the producers, transporters and storage providers in 
addition to market area opportunities. The team will utilize all of ENA,s 
product capabilities including the gas commodity, assets and capital. Each of 
these groups will report directly to the EA OOC;
East Gas ) a single East Gas Team incorporating trading, mid-market and 
origination will be formed under the co-leadership of Scott Neal and Frank 
Vickers who will be returning from Portland to join this team.  
West Gas  ) in a similar manner, a West Gas Team will be formed co-managed by 
Phillip Allen and Barry Tycholiz, who will be joining us in Houston from the 
Canadian team. The Denver office under Mark Whitt will be integrated under 
this team.
Central Gas )  in a similar manner, a Central Gas Team will be formed 
co-managed by Hunter Shively and Laura Luce. The Chicago office will be 
integrated into this team.
Texas Gas ) the Texas Gas Team will be managed by Tom Martin. This team will 
continue to manage the gas trading business around HPL until the pending sale 
is concluded in Q2 2001.  After the sale of HPL, this team will build a Texas 
gas business without ownership of the HPL assets.  
Financial ) this group will continue to be managed by John Arnold with no 
significant changes.
Derivatives ) this group, lead by Fred Lagrasta, will offer derivative and 
financial mid-market products and services to the natural gas market 
specifically targeting CFO,s and treasury departments.  Fred will continue to 
maintain certain existing mid-market accounts with a number of producer and 
industrial accounts where relationships are well formed. Otherwise, 
mid-market coverage will gravitate to the regions. The New York office gas 
marketing efforts will continue to be managed by Fred.
Upstream Products ) this group, lead by Jean Mrha, will develop several 
distinct product offerings for the upstream segment of the gas market.  This 
group will develop and market the product in conjunction with the regions. 
This is consistent with our desire to have a broader product offering and 
greater market penetration in the upstream segment.  These products include 
producer outsourcing, similar to our successful Petro-Canada and Suncor 
relationships in Canada, physical storage re-engineering, compressor 
services, wellhead liquidity products and offshore asset and capital 
products.  In addition, Jean will manage our Bridgeline joint venture with 
Texaco.  
Gas Structuring ) this group will be lead by Ed McMichael, reporting to Frank 
Vickers, will provide structuring and deal support to all the gas teams.
Gas Fundamentals ) this group will be lead by Chris Gaskill, reporting to 
Hunter Shively, will provide fundamentals to all the gas teams.    

Julie Gomez will continue to support the gas floor through several identified 
projects including long-term supply/demand analysis and, natural gas 
transportation capacity trading opportunities.
 
There is an expectation of some customer overlap between the gas and power 
groups; for example, the combination utilities and the IPP,s.  The teams will 
coordinate with regard to the combination utilities like Con. Edison or 
PG&E.  With regard to the IPP,s, to the extent that the product offering 
involves an underlying power position, the power teams will manage. We have 
asked Janet Dietrich to coordinate such overlaps between the two 
organizations in Houston. 

e) Technical/Restructuring - In the effort to consolidate and centralize our 
technical resources (engineering, development, operations, pipeline) to 
ensure that this skill base is available to all ENA groups and utilized 
productively across the organization, Brian Redmond will form and manage the 
Technical Services Group.  This group will manage ENA,s technical risks and 
will provide, on a cost basis, technical services for the entire ENA 
organization. This group will manage the interface with EE&CC and OEC.  In 
addition, the Restructuring Group, currently managed by Dick Lydecker, will 
report to Brian Redmond.  This group is currently monetizing a large portion 
of the merchant investment portfolio given our current strategies.  This 
group will have continuing responsibility to manage troubled commodity and 
capital transactions that need considerable time and attention to manage risk 
and monetize. 

In addition to these responsibilities, Brian will manage the pending sale and 
transition of the HPL asset over the next couple quarters as regulatory and 
securities approvals are obtained in order to complete the sale.  Brian will 
report to the EA OOC.

f) Principal Investing  )  with the departure of Jeff Donahue to new 
opportunities in EBS, ENA,s venture capital function will be managed by 
Michael L. Miller.  This group makes small investments in distributed 
generation, power quality and technology companies that can benefit from 
Enron,s distribution channels and expertise.  Michael will report to the EA 
OOC.

g) Corporate Development ) Tim Detmering will assume the corporate 
development responsibilities for ENA as Jeff transitions to his new role and 
will report to the EA OOC.

h) Generation Investments ) there will be no changes to this group managed by 
Dave Duran. Dave will continue to report to the EA OOC.

i) Energy Capital Resources ) there will be no changes to this group 
currently lead by C. John Thompson and Scott Josey.  John and Scott will 
continue to report to the EA OOC.

As a final note in the interest of keeping things simple, Enron Americas will 
have two operating divisions  - Enron North America and Enron South America.  
As a result, we will continue to conduct business under these two operating 
companies; therefore, eliminating the need to change legal entities et al.  
If you are currently a commercial employee of ENA or ESA you will continue to 
conduct business in that company. 

We look forward to another exciting year in the North American energy 
market.  This is certainly a company unrivaled in the marketplace with the 
most talented employees.  The opportunities are endless.  We wish you and 
your family a very happy and safe holiday season."

		The Onion  
		
		Quick! What's the funniest site on the Web? If you said The Onion, ""America's 
Finest News Source,"" consider your sense of humor validated. This online 
newspaper is the best social satire going -- no small feat in this 
postmodern, post-satire age. Ostensibly another news site, The Onion offers a 
twisted view of current events and the typical fodder of local newspapers. 
The current issue has election news -- ""Vote, Voter Wasted"" -- and human 
interest -- ""Neighborhood Children Gear Up for Hotly Anticipated 'Opening of 
the Gerbil's Tomb.'"" The site uses friends and relations of the editors for 
pictures. Good sports because usually they're posing as the incredible dweebs 
and losers populating the typical Onion news story. Be warned -- The Onion is 
too funny to resist. You'll be mailing stories to friends and wasting the 
boss's time if you're not careful. By the way, the Onion bills itself as ""not 
intended for readers under 18 years of age."" I might ! recommend that the 
easily offended or politically rigid avoid it, for the sake of cardiovascular 
health.

		When You're Sidelined By Sickness  
		
		If you're pretty committed to your exercise routine, having a cold or the flu 
makes you feel twice as bad because you suffer the added stress of missing 
your workouts. Many athletes think that they should limit their food intake 
during an ""off"" period, but depriving a recovering body from nutrition can 
make healing take even longer. Sleep is another great healer, so be sure to 
get at least eight hours a night when you're under the weather. Also, in a 
desire to get healthier and drop excess weight, many people become 
overzealous and lose weight too fast, often ending up sick, so play it smart 
when trimming down.

		Arctic Trucks   
		
		I was watching a cable TV show about these guys from Iceland who drove 
modified Toyota Land Cruisers across Antarctica -- more plush than a dogsled, 
you may be sure. It looked like quite an adventure. The neat thing was their 
Web address on the  side of the vehicles -- www.arctictrucks.is. I reached 
over, typed in the URL, and soon had their site up. I even sent an e-mail, 
and I got a quick response. Kinda neat the way the Web makes the world 
smaller. Here I was, watching TV in America about Icelanders at the South 
Pole, and communicating directly with them (in Iceland) at the same time. If 
I'd been in the market for a SUV modified for arctic conditions, they'd have 
probably made a sale. They take Toyota Land Cruisers (or other SUVs) and 
modify them to cruise comfortably over ice and snow in the coldest weather 
you can imagine. Rescue vehicles are a specialty. If you need one, here's the 
source!

		Alaskan Wilderness Waits on Florida Vote
		The fate of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge may rest on whoever wins the 
still-undecided presidential vote in Florida. Thousands of demonstrators 
flocked to the Hague to warn of global warming's threat to low-lying nations. 
A congressional group urges more spending on space surveillance. French 
scientists have developed useful fibers made of carbon nanotubes, which have 
amazing properties. It's more difficult to predict when women are most 
fertile than many suspected. A newly discovered dinosaur species, Bienosaurus 
crichtonii, honors ""Jurassic Park"" author Michael Crichton. ICANN has 
approved new Internet domain names, including .biz and .info. And DNA studies 
show that right whales living in the North Pacific are a unique species.

		Stretching Out Upper-Back Stress  
		
		If your shoulders and upper back are tight after a day at the computer, try 
this stretch to work out the kinks. Pick a corner and stand facing it, with 
your feet about the same width apart as your shoulders. Place your hands on 
the walls at the same height as your shoulders. Now, lean forward, feeling 
your shoulder blades pinch together and your chest stretching open. You can 
change your hand positions slightly to work different muscle groups as you 
repeat the exercise three times.

		HoaxKill  
		
		There are several good Net-hoax sites. HoaxKill is one of them. HoaxKill was 
created ""to help you identify hoaxes and to actively combat them."" It debunks 
Net myths and legends, virus hoaxes, chain letters, e-mail fundraising hoaxes 
and scams, and the like. It also lists common jokes and related Net culture. 
It offers links to related sites.
		
		This is a handy site to bookmark. The next time you receive an e-mail chain 
letter, a suspicious virus warning, an inspiring story of unusual courage, or 
a heads-up about an outrage, check with HoaxKill first. There's a good chance 
it's bogus. Several online friends-o-mine are somewhat susceptible to such 
communiqu,s, particularly those prompting political outrage. HoaxKill can nip 
'em in the bud.

		140-ton Junkpile to Hit Earth!
		Russia plans to ditch the claptrap Mir space station in the Pacific after a 
""controlled descent"" from orbit. A team based at Woods Hole will study the 
Atlantis Massif, a 12,000-ft underwater mountain much taller than its 
neighbors. Amtrak has high hopes for its 150-mph Acela Express train. 
Researchers say the ability of monkeys to control robot arms wired to their 
brains could mean hope for paralysis victims. Inuit in the Canadian Arctic 
say they're sure the world is getting warmer. They're not alone -- Pacific 
marine species are essentially saying the same thing. A study comparing human 
and mouse genes sheds light on ""impriinting."" And stargazers will have no 
opposition to the rare spectacle of Saturn and Jupiter in close ""opposition"" 
to the Earth -- their closest approach to our planet. Click  here to read

		Push-Ups By Design  
		
		Doing push-ups immediately gives us visions of military punishment. But yours 
don't have to be torture, because there are many ways to tailor this exercise 
to your fitness level. Keep in mind that what makes push-ups difficult or 
easy is the amount of pressure on your arms. Once you're in the traditional 
push-up stance, you can lessen the pressure by allowing your knees to rest on 
the floor (modified push-up stance). You can increase the pressure by putting 
your feet up on a weight bench or chair, causing you to lean more on your 
arms. Also, moving your hands farther apart or closer together works 
different muscles.

Hope you all llike this one.  It's sweet.

Love ya'll

Coco

Sally was only eight years old when she heard Mommy and Daddy talking about
her little brother, Georgi. He was very sick and they had done everything
they could afford to save his life. Only a very expensive surgery could help
him now and that was out of the financial question. She heard Daddy say it
with a whispered desperation, ""Only a miracle can save him now.""

Sally went to her bedroom and pulled her piggy bank from its hiding
place in the closet. She shook all the change out on the floor and
counted it carefully. Three times. The total had to be exactly
perfect. No chance here for mistakes. Tying the coins up in a kerchief, she
slipped out of the apartment and made her way to the corner drug store.

She waited patiently for the pharmacist to give her attention but he was too
busy talking to another man to be bothered by an eight year old.Sally
twisted her feet to make a scuffing noise. She cleared her throat. No
good.Finally she took a quarter from its hiding place and banged it on the
glass counter. That did it!

""And what do you want?"" the pharmacist asked in an annoyed tone of voice.
""I'm talking to my brother.""

""Well, I want to talk to you about my brother,"" Sally answered back in the
same annoyed tone. ""He's sick ... and I want to buy a miracle."" ""I beg your
pardon,"" said the pharmacist. ""My Daddy says only a miracle  can save him
now. So how much does a miracle cost?""

""We don't sell miracles here, little girl. I can't help you.""

""Listen, I have the money to pay for it. Just tell me how much it
costs.""

The well dressed man stooped down and asked, ""What kind of a miracle does
your brother need?"" ""I don't know,"" Sally answered. A tear  started down her
cheek. ""I just know he's really sick and Mommy says he needs an operation.
But my folks can't pay for it, so I have my money.

""How much do you have?"" asked the well dressed man. ""A dollar and eleven
cents,"" Sally answered proudly. ""And it's all the money I have in the
world.""

""Well, what a coincidence,"" smiled the man. ""A dollar and eleven cents--the
exact price of a miracle to save a little brother. ""He took her money in one
hand and with the other hand he grasped her mitten and said ""Take me to
where you live. I want to see your brother and meet your parents.""

That well dressed man was Dr. Carlton Armstrong, renowned surgeon,
specializing in solving Georgi's malady. The operation was completed without
charge and it wasn't long until Georgi was home again and doing well. Mommy
and Daddy were happily talking about the chain of events that had led them
to this place. ""That surgery,"" Mommy whispered. ""It's like a miracle. I
wonder how much it would have cost?""

Sally smiled to herself. She knew exactly how much a miracle
cost...one dollar and eleven cents ... plus the faith of a little child.

Also,
following is a follow-up to a question about The Lord's Prayer and what
Jesus meant when He said ""Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from
evil"".  Mary Rios, thank you for asking.  It has been a rewarding study as I
have searched the Word, Strong's and other resources and it is beautiful.
First, here is an insert from what Eloise, our dear sister that comes to the
Bible Study on Wednesday's with Pat McFarland has to offer.  I asked her to
write it down for us as a remind:

Carol,

Thank you so much for your prayers.  I did get your message and here is
the verse of the Lord's Prayer, we tallked about  in class.  The
Spanish  version is ""No, los dejes caer ententacion"", interpreted as
""No, Let us not fall into temptation.""  Or it can be ""No, lead us not
into temptation.""  Either one is asking in prayer for our Lord Savior to
help in the choices we are faced with daily and many times there are
temptations.

Carol, the word Lead, I believe is problably what has confused the
lady in class and maybe the word Let might also, but we need to look at
the total verse.  I honestly believe the articulation in much of the
material we process sometimes needs to be looked at closely for precise
meaning.  I believe that in praying and asking for our Lord Jesus to
discern what is really meant, this is my answer."

Fact of the Day

 


American poet and novelist Sylvia Plath published her first poem at age eight 
and while still in high school she sold her first poem to Seventeen magazine. 
Plath is best known for her semi-autobiographical novel titled ""The Bell Jar"" 
which was first published in 1963 under the pseudonym ""Victoria Lucas."" 
Constantly haunted by anxiety and doubt, Plath took her own life later that 
year. With the re-release of ""The Bell Jar"" under her own name in 1966, Plath 
was able to posthumously secure a spot on the bookshelves of main stream 
America. For more, click here.

Joke of the Day

 Steve's a Jerk


Once upon a time there was a woman married to an annoying man named Steve. He 
would complain about everything. That day he went to their creek with his 
mule. He complained so much that the mule got annoyed and kicked him to 
death.  

At the funeral, when all the men walked by the wife she shook her head yes 
and every time the women walked by she shook her head no.  

The minister asked ""Why are you shaking your head 'yes' for men and 'no' for 
women?""  

Her response was, ""The men would say how sorry they felt for me and I was 
saying, 'Yes, I'll be alright.' When the women walked by, they were asking if 
the mule is for sale....""

		The Cartoon Bank   
		
		No one should doubt that, since the 1920s, ""The New Yorker"" has published the 
funniest and wittiest cartoons in the business. The magazine's archives 
contain tens of thousands of great cartoons by the likes of Charles Addams, 
Peter Arno, Saul Steinberg, William Steig, James Thurber, Gahan Wilson, Roz 
Chast, Jack Ziegler and others. They're all being made available online at 
The Cartoon Bank, ""the largest searchable cartoon database on the web."" You 
can search its vast archives for your favorite cartoonist, or send e-cards, 
or buy prints, t-shirts, and even original cartoon artwork. Its Cartoon 
Channel pop-up offers an ever-changing parade of cartoons on your desktop. 
Recent cartoons and cartoonists are more heavily represented than some of the 
""classics,"" in part because it takes time to scan them into the database. The 
goal is to have them all available and searchable online. The search engines 
works great, by the way. I found a favorite Charl! es Addams cartoon in one 
try!

		Lunging Across The Floor  
		
		To tone and strengthen hamstrings and gluteus muscles, try performing lunges 
across the floor. Start by standing with your feet together, then take a 
giant step forward with your right leg. Let your right knee bend to a 
90-degree angle, so that your hips are on the same level as your right knee. 
Slowly stand and bring your left leg forward to meet your right leg, so that 
you've taken a big step forward. Perform 10 steps on the right leg, then 10 
on the left leg. Increase by working up to three sets of 10, and make it even 
harder by holding 10-pound weights in your hands.

Cool Site of the Day

 


The New York Review of Books may be a bit too pretentious for some, but it's 
more than worth plodding through for its literary value. The magazine's got a 
long list of contributors who've all made a huge mark on the world of letters 
- Norman Mailer, Saul Bellow and Truman Capote, to name a few. Another 
highlight is the caricatures gallery by the journal's artist, David Levine. 
And finally, for those looking to avoid online booksellers' ""book 
suggestions"" that are just thinly-veiled advertisements, you'll find a 
plethora of genuine recommendations here. Read on. www.nybooks.com

Poppycock comes from the Dutch pappekak, and it describes something that is 
nonsense or whose value is equivalent to its original meaning: soft dung. For

Joke of the Day

 Out of the Mouths of Babes


A first grade teacher collected well known proverbs. She gave each
child in her class the first half of a proverb and asked them to come 
up with the remainder of the proverb. Their insight may surprise you.

Better to be safe than....................Punch a 5th grader

It's always darkest before............... Daylight Savings

You can lead a horse to water but.........how?

Don't bite the hand that................. looks dirty

If you lie down with dogs, you'll.........stink in the morning

Happy the bride who.......................gets all the presents

Don't put off till tomorrow what..........you put on to go to bed

Children should be seen and not...........spanked or grounded

You get out of something what you.........see pictured on the box

And the favorite...

Better late than..........................pregnant

Cool Site of the Day

 


The ancient Chinese art of origami (which literally means ""to fold paper"") is 
remarkably documented at Joseph Wu's Origami Page. And whether you're a 
seasoned pro or have never heard the term until now, you've got to check this 
site out. For the uninitiated, there are many galleries to roam around that 
contain some of the wildest paperfolding you will surely ever see - check out 
Wu's own paper microscope for proof. You will also find the history of the 
art, links to origami sites across the entire Web, instructions on how to 
learn the art, supply information, and plenty of diagrams on how to perfect 
some of the more popular folds. Old pros will find a community thriving here 
that will support even the most wild paper-folders out there. Get to it!

		Book Search Engines    
		
		If you're a book collector, or a bargain hunter, or if you need an 
out-of-print title, then try some of the used book search engines on the Web. 
These link together hundreds of small (and not-so-small) bookstores coast to 
coast and in other countries, letting you search hundreds of inventories for 
the right book. You can search title, author, publisher, and other 
attributes, like hardbound or paperback, dust jacket, first edition, etc. 
Condition is listed, too. You often get multiple hits for titles, giving you 
a choice of prices. Collectors can find what they need to round out their 
favorite authors. Bargain hunters can find used copies of out-of-print books. 
You can purchase the books online, too. Two of the best are ABE and Alibris. 
Both give you lots of search options.
		
		Visit ABE.
		
		Try Alibris.

		Steppin' Into Shape  
		
		If there's one piece of equipment in the gym that everyone's lining up to 
use, it's the stair-stepper. Get the most out of your stepping by keeping 
these guidelines in mind:
		
		- Good form is key. Keep your back straight and pump your arms naturally, 
like you're running (don't lean on the machine).
		- Keep your heels in contact with the steps. You'll get a better workout on 
your glutes, not just your calfs.
		- Use a short range of motion on the pedals by keeping them from coming all 
the way up or down.
		- Throw in periods of fast stepping to keep thing interesting while 
increasing your intensity.

,11/14/2000,,enron.announcements@enron.com,all.houston@enron.com,,Reorganization of Houston and Omaha Facilities Management --  --  Responsibilities,"Responsibility  for daily operations of building support services in the 
Enron Building, Houston leased offices, and Two Pacific Place (Omaha) will be 
transitioning from Corporate to Enron Energy Services (EES) by year-end.  The 
areas affected include facility operations and maintenance of mechanical, 
electrical, and air-conditioning systems; mail delivery;  housekeeping;  
food, copier, and records services.

This transition of services, as presently managed by Enron Property and 
Services Corp. (EPSC), is designed to optimize value to Enron,s Business 
Units by leveraging facility management businesses now offered by EES to 
their commercial customers.  EPSC staff having administrative responsibility 
for these services will report to Enron Facility Services, a subsidiary of 
EES,s Global Energy Services group led by Daniel Leff, President and CEO.

EPSC is responsible for Enron,s internal real estate and office development 
needs, including leasing, space allocations and facility planning, project 
and construction management, furniture systems, and office relocation.  EPSC, 
in its development role, remains a part of Enron Corporate Administration 
Services (ECAS) along with Corporate Security and the Aviation Department, 
reporting to Bill Donovan, Vice President, Corporate Administrative Services.

This alignment of responsibilities offers the opportunity for EPSC to focus 
resources on effective utilization of our existing office space assets and 
managing the development of Houston,s new Enron Center Campus project."

		Internet Tip of the Day
		Tuesday November 14, 2000
		
		Web Activism   
		
		A while back we mentioned the problem of Web porn. Several readers wrote to 
ask how to get involved. Even with a World Wide Web of resources, however, 
the best place to start is locally. The Web can help! You can search for 
local groups, like churches, clubs, advocacy agencies, and local government 
offices. Many sites will have links to other local and regional groups with 
similar views and goals. There are lots of national and international groups, 
too, but sometimes they aren't what their high-minded names suggest, so be 
sure to check them out before you give them any of your time or money! That's 
another reason to act locally -- it's easier to find out where others stand, 
and your efforts may be more appreciated at the local level than the national 
llevel. You can build a network of contacts over time, too -- the Web makes 
it easy to stay in touch and involved.

		Simple Squats, Big Results  
		
		Most of us think of squats as a knee-wrenching, heavy weight exercise. But 
they don't have to be killers to be effective. Instead of hefting a weighted 
bar onto your neck, hold 10-pound dumbbells in each hand and rest them at the 
top of your legs, just below your hips. Stand with your legs apart and your 
feet pointed out. Now squat until your legs are bent at 90-degree angles but 
your knees aren't out over your toes, then stand up again. Do as many reps as 
you can handle comfortably.

,11/13/2000,,office.chairman@enron.com,all.worldwide@enron.com,,Chairman's Award Nominations,"The 2000 Chairman's Award nomination process was a tremendous success!  From 
around the world, over 425 nominations were received representing a broad 
cross-section of our overall organization and resulting in a 73% increase in 
nomination participation from last year.  This 100% employee-driven program 
is so successful because you take time to nominate and recognize those 
individuals that are special in your work life.  Every single candidate is to 
be congratulated!  

This year, the original concept was brought to fruition when the members of 
the 1999 Chairman's Roundtable took over the selection process and carried 
the torch from past to present.  This Selection Committee reviewed all 
candidates on the basis of their ability to consistently bring our values to 
life and sought out those select few that are Enron's ""everyday heroes"".  

It is with great pleasure that we announce the 2000 Chairman's Roundtable 
whose daily pursuit of excellence, commitment to communication, genuine 
integrity and respect for others are what make Enron the incredible company 
that it is today - innovative, successful and undoubtedly one of the best 
places to work.  The eleven individuals named below are flying to San Antonio 
this from around the world to be honored at our annual Management 
Conference.  One of these finalist will receive the distinguished recognition 
as the actual Chairman's Award winner:

THE 2000 CHAIRMAN'S ROUNDTABLE

Amelia Alder, Enron Operations Services (ETS) - Houston, Texas
Dan Boyle, Enron Global Finance - Houston, Texas
Craig Buehler, Northern Natural Gas (ETS) - Houston, TX
Fernando Delpino, Industrias Ventane (ESA) - Caracas, Venezuala
Barbara Gray, ENA - Houston, Texas
Scott Guptill, PGE - Portland, OR
Mark Harada, EES - Hinsdale, IL

Xafira Mendonsa, Dahbol Power Company - Mumbia, India
Yaser Tobeh, Operational Energy Corp. (EES) - Gaza, Palestine
Kevin Westwood, Enron Teeside Operations Ltd. - Cleveland, England


Attached is a list of every employee who was nominated for the Chairman's 
Award this year:



Please take a moment to recognize this honor bestowed upon your fellow 
employees.  We sincerely thank them for their contributions to Enron and 
their leadership that helps make this organization the world,s leading energy

Some of Enron Confirmation Letters are able to fit on one page, example: Duke 
Energy Marketing and Trading LLC are often able to fit on one page (not all 
the time).  In the past Duke one page Confirmation Letters we coming over 
with a number 1 on the bottom, but both signatures (Enron and Counterparty) 
were included.  We have taken the page number out of the template and 
hopefully all is corrected.  If you see an Enron Confirmation Letter with 
both signatures included although it might have a Page 1 on the bottom, and 
no other changes, it is okay to Execute the Confirmation Letter.  If you have 
any questions, please let me know!

Fact of the Day

 


Archie Comics fans will be happy to know that a ""real-life"" film version of 
""Josie and the Pussycats"" is in the works and is scheduled to hit theaters in 
2001. Aging Gen X'ers may remember the 1970s Hanna-Barbera ""Pussycat"" series, 
on which Cheryl Ladd of ""Charlie's Angels"" fame provided the singing voice 
for ditsy drummer Melody Valentine. For more, click here.

Joke of the Day

 


*** Accouting for Taste 

The accountant for the law firm of Dewey, Cheatham & Howe was retiring after 
working for the firm for seventeen years. Cheatham was interviewing 
applicants, and was disappointed, as only three had even bothered to send in 
a resume.  

After looking over the application of the first, an accountant with six years 
experience at Goldman Sachs, he called the first applicant in, and asked the 
woman what 2 plus 2 was.  

She answered, ""Four.""  

Cheatham said he would call her if she was selected.  

The second candidate was a CPA from Harvard, and at the end of the interview 
he was asked the same question, ""What is two and two?""  

The CPA replied, ""Four."" Cheatham told him that he would call the young man 
if he was selected.  

The third applicant was a recently-graduated philosophy. Cheatham figured 
that this wasn't going to go anywhere, but thought, ""What the hey? I've got 
nothing to lose.""  

He interviewed the young man quickly and asked, ""I know you don't have an 
accountancy background, but can you tell me what two plus two is?""  

To which the philosophy major replied, ""Can you tell me what would you want 
it to be?""  

And was hired on the spot.

		Pickover.com  
		
		One of the coolest personal sites on the Web belongs to the noted physicist 
Clifford Pickover. He's an interesting and intelligent guy, to say the least, 
and he has an opinion on just about everything under the sun. What's more, he 
wants to hear your views, too. His site lets you contribute your own ideas 
and opinions about his thought-provoking excursions into science, ethics, 
philosophy, behavior, and ( well, as I said, just about everything under the 
Sun! Dr. Pickover has written numerous mind-expanding books (which you can 
buy from his site), and he continues some of the provocative and engrossing 
lines of thought on his Website -- art, science, God, consciousness, the 
universe, extraterrestrial life, quantum physics, mathematics, puzzles, -- 
something  for everyone. Cliff Pickover has one of the better minds among our 
six billion relatives. I for one am glad he's chosen to share it with the Web 
world.

		A new species of dinosaur discovered in Italy is one of the earliest known 
carnivorous reptiles. Four out of five European men share a common genetic 
ancestor who lived 40,000 years ago. Ancient Bolivian practices hold lessons 
for modern ecologists. State-funded studies pushed back the date of China's 
civilization some 1,200 years -- enough to equal other ancient civilizations. 
A UK company is weaving wires into cloth, which means washable and wearable 
ellectronics. This year's Leonid meteor shower will peak late Friday night

		The Sun Never Sets On Hydration  
		
		It's easy to overlook your hydration needs once summer's heat stops 
antagonizing your workout. But don't be fooled into believing that you need 
much less water in cooler temperatures. Everyone's need for water varies, 
depending upon what you eat and how much you sweat, but a general rule is to 
drink a quart of water for every hour of exercise you do. And of course, 
that's in addition to the eight glasses you're already drinking daily.

Dear Sir or Madam :

 Enron Corp. (&Enron8) believes in conducting its business affairs in 
accordance with the highest ethical standards.  Accordingly, employees of 
Enron and its subsidiaries are required to comply with Enron's Business 
Ethics Policy which requires an employee to conduct himself/herself in a 
manner which is not detrimental to the best interests of Enron and which does 
not bring to the employee financial gain separately derived as a direct 
consequence of his/her employment with Enron.  Further, Enron's Business 
Ethics Policy states that no lavish entertainment or gifts are to be given or 
received by Enron employees for special position, price, or privilege.

 Not only is it incumbent upon our employees to follow this policy, but your 
cooperation in respecting these standards is also critical.  Enron expects 
each of its vendors and contractors to maintain adequate records that 
document its work relationship with Enron.  Enron's auditing department will 
routinely conduct business ethics compliance audits of certain vendors and 
contractors with whom Enron does business.  Your recognition of our ethical 
standards allows Enron employees to work with you via arm's length 
transactions and avoids potentially embarrassing and unethical situations.  
If you ever become aware of variances from our policy, please advise:

James V. Derrick, Jr.
Executive Vice President
and General   Counsel

Long before one's box of Cap'n Crunch or Rice Krispies came with a plastic 
tchotchke, Kellogg's Corn Flakes ran the first breakfast cereal premium 
offer. In 1909, the Funny Jungleland Moving Pictures Booklet was available 
with the purchase of two packages of Kellogg's Corn Flakes. The offer ran for

with CORESTAFF's Managed Services Group to manage and administer its
temporary staffing program. This new arrangement is designed to improve
service and quality as well as increase efficiency in meeting Enron's
temporary employment needs. There are many benefits, including a web-based
application which will provide Enron's temporary staffing users with online
ordering, approval and reporting. More details on this system will be coming
soon.

In order to help the Managed Services Group serve you better in the days
ahead, please take a moment now to fill out the profile questions below and
forward your reply to Joseph Marsh at Joseph Marsh/NA/Enron. This
information will not be used for solicitation, but rather to facilitate a

note that we anticipate no changes for temporary employees currently on
assignment at Enron as we make this transition.  Again, more details on the
Managed Services program and processes will be distributed in the coming
weeks.

As of January 2, the Managed Services account team will be on-site to answer
any questions and handle your temporary employee needs.  They will be
available via e-mail or by calling 713-345-6899.  Please note that the
current process for requesting temporary employees will remain in effect
through the end of the year.

Cool Site of the Day

 


Adam Sandler's new movie, ""Little Nicky,"" hits theaters this weekend and it 
turns out it's a 19th Century British period piece. Just kidding. To get the 
skinny on the flick, head over to its devil-themed Web site. Download screen 
savers and desktop wallpaper, watch the trailer, play Devil's Hangman and 
read up on the cast, crew and storyline. Nice looking and lots of fun, this 
site would make Little Nicky very proud. www.littlenicky.com

Fact of the Day

 


In 1921, an unknown World War I American soldier was buried in Arlington 
National Cemetery while similar ceremonies were also held in England and 
France. These memorial services all took place on Nov. 11 to commemorate the 
anniversary of the end of World War I (Nov. 11, 1918). This day of 
remembrance became known as Armistice Day and on June 1, 1954, the name was 
changed to Veterans Day to honor all U.S. veterans. For more, click here.

Joke of the Day

 


*** Starbuckaroo  

The gal was in a coffee shop, surveying the establishment's menu. After 15 
minutes, the counter guy got impatient.  

""How about this?"" he asked, jabbing his finger at the menu item, ""latte.""  

""Nooo,"" said the blond slowly, ""I need to have it early.""

should be, because sooner or later, if you are posing, you will forget the 
pose, and then where are you?"" - Fanny Brice, actress and singer (1891-1951).

Cool Site of the Day

 


Mr. Winkle is a real dog who lives in Los Angeles. And like everybody else in 
that city, he's really cute but something's a little off. Check Winkle out 
for yourself at his Web site and see if you agree. The exact breed of this 
phenomenal dog is unknown and the owner is obviously enjoying making money 
off of the fact - calendars, posters and ""short films"" have been created 
around him and are for sale at the site (naturally). Hear Mr. Winkle pant and 
bark as you roam around, and make sure to get a good, long look - you're not 
likely to see another dog like this ever again. www.mrwinkle.com

		Hikers' Hints  
		
		Fall is a great time to hit the trail and take advantage of great scenery and 
still-comfortable temperatures. Make sure you have supportive hiking boots, 
though, so that your feet don't give out before you're ready to call it a 
day. Leather is generally the preferred boot material since it breathes and 
softens, unlike some synthetics. Make sure your toes don't hit the boots' end 
(especially down hills), but also that your feet don't slide around much. 
Take another step against blisters by wearing thin liner socks inside of your 
hiking socks.

TRANSACTION DEVELOPMENT
Transaction Development, headed by Rodney Malcolm, works with Pulp & Paper, 
Lumber and Steel to structure and execute some of the more complex deals.  
Members of the Transaction Development team have a strong track record of 
closing structured transactions involving both capital and commodity risks.  
Sample deals would include working on the acquisition of Garden State Paper 
earlier this year, and structuring and pitching the first all requirements, 
index based, physical steel supply contract to one of the largest players in 
the steel servicing segment of the steel industry.

The ability to buy and sell physical product will be critical to creating a 
commodity product in these businesses.  Getting access to the physical 
product will require creating compelling financing structures, as well as 
potentially buying assets to get control of their production capability.  In 
all these situations, the Transaction Development team will be a key player 
in driving these opportunities to closure.

The king had a beautiful daughter, 
the princess. 

But there was a problem. 
Everything the princess touched would melt. 
No matter what; 
metal, 
wood, 
plastic 
anything she touched would melt. 

Because of this, men were afraid of her. 
Nobody would dare marry her. 

The king despaired. 
What could he do to help his daughter? 

He consulted his wizards and magicians. 
One wizard told the king, 

""If your daughter touches one thing 
that does not melt in her hands, 
she will be cured."" 

The king was overjoyed. 

The next day, 
he held a competition. 
Any man that could bring his daughter an 
object that would not melt would marry her 
and inherit the king's wealth. 

Three young princes took up the challenge. 

The first prince brought a very hard alloy of titanium. 
But alas, 
once the princess touched it, 
it melted. 
The prince went away sadly. 

The second prince brought a huge diamond, 
thinking that diamond is the hardest substance 
in the world and would not melt. 
But alas, 
once the princess touched it, 
it melted. 
He too was sent away disappointed. 

The third prince approached. 
He told the princess, 
""Put your hand in my pocket and feel what 
is in there."" 
The princess did as she was told, 
though she turned red. 
She felt something hard. 
She held it in her hand. 
And it did not melt!!! 

The king was overjoyed. 
Everybody in the kingdom was overjoyed. 
And the third prince married the princess 
and they both lived happily ever after. 


Question: 

What was the object in the prince's pants?

They were M&M's of course. 
They melt in your mouth, not in your hand.

What were you thinking?

		Health & Fitness Tip of the Day
		Monday October 30, 2000
		
		Food's Safety Zone  
		
		When it comes to keeping foods cold or hot enough to discourage bacteria's 
growth, you're operating within a 100-degree zone. Don't let food sit outside 
the oven or refrigerator where it can cool or warm to anywhere from 40 to 140 
degrees. As soon as you've finished, put leftovers in the refrigerator - or 
even into the freezer for a short time - to cool them more quickly. And don't 
worry - your fridge is designed to handle the temporary heat from warm food.

Due to unavoidable construction delays, the Body Shop reopening is now

Facilities Staff and Body Shop Staff are diligently working to complete the 
renovation efforts, but there are still many things to do to get the 
equipment safely in place and in good working condition before our members 
can utilize the onsite facility. 

Below we have listed some of the new amenities our newly renovated workout

The Spring/Summer 1999 Hard Copy Enron Phone Books - may be the last paper 
phone book we'll ever have for Enron.     So, if some of the common numbers 
or unchanged information is helpful to you, please keep your book.

Per Facilities, there is a task force to see if the On-line book can be 
redesigned to better incorporate the international offices, as well as stay 
up with all the Enron changes.

FYI - Enron is currently having approximately 500 employee changes - per week.
Per Facilities, it is due to both the growth and the moves.

Thank you for bringing this to our attention.  In researching these documents 
we have identified several issues that have now been and will continue to be 
addressed.  I apologize for the inconvenience that this has caused and we 
will be revising procedures to ensure that this does not happen in the 
future.  Below describes the situation leading to each document not being 
executed as it should have been:

479893.01, 469240.01, 475138.01, 475515.01: 
These documents were identified as needing review by power.  When a document 
is identified as needing review, it is placed in a designated spot.  These 
documents are to be reviewed weekly by us to determine if we are to file or 
execute the document.  These documents were not reviewed in a timely manner, 
resulting in never being tracked.  

443765.01 
This deal number was incorrectly tracked on 10/30 (wrong deal # typed into 
Tagg).  This error was discovered on 11/06 and the status was    changed back 
to sent to counterparty after the real 443765.01 had come through, which 
changed a correct status of executed for the document to an incorrect status 
of sent to counterparty.

442125.01 
This deal number was incorrectly tracked on 10/27 (wrong deal # typed into 
Tagg).  This error was discovered on 11/2 and the status was changed back to 
sent to counterparty after the real 442125.01 had come through, which changed 
a correct status of executed for the document to an incorrect status of sent 
to counterparty.

444725.01,444890.01 
Deal numbers typed into Tagg, but when highlighting all documents to change 
status to Executed, these deals were not highlighted to update status.  
Therefore these documents were not updated.  

461051.01
This document is still being researched.

In an effort to correct these issues we will be modifying our current 
procedure of reviewing the power revised documents weekly as well as 
addressing the importance of focusing directly on the task at hand.  Those of 
us working directly with confirmations will be meeting tomorrow to discuss 
these issues and the several procedural changes that will be taking place.  
Again, I am sorry for the inconvenience and we will be working to ensure that 
this does not happen in the future.  

If you have questions regarding these explanations, please feel free to call 
me and I will explain further.

Thank you,
Brenna

 ?A man's daughter  had asked the local minister to come and pray 
  with her father.  When the minister arrived, he found the man lying 
  in bed with his head propped up on two pillows.  An empty chair 
  sat beside his bed.  The minister assumed that the old fellow had 
  been informed of his visit. ""I ?guess you were expecting me,""  he said. 
 ? 
 ?""No, who are you?""  said the father. 
 ? 
 ?The minister told him his name and then remarked, ""I see the empty 
  chair; I figured you knew I was going to show up."" 
 ? 
 ?""Oh yeah, the chair,""  said the bedridden man. ""Would you mind closing 
  the door?""  Puzzled, the minister ?shut the door. ""I have never told anyone 
  this, not even my daughter,"" said the man. ""But all of  my life I have 
 ?never ?known how to pray.   At church I used  to hear the pastor 
 ?talk about prayer, but it went right over my  head.  I abandoned 
 ?any attempt at prayer,"" the old man continued, ""until one day about 
 ?four years ago my best friend said to me, 'Johnny, prayer is just 
 ?a simple matter of having a  conversation with Jesus.  Here is what 
 ?I suggest.  ""Sit down in a chair; place an empty chair in front of 
 ?you, and in faith see Jesus on the chair.   It's not spooky because he 
 ?promised, ""I'll  be with you always."" Then just speak to him in the 
 ?same way  you're doing with me right now.' ""So, I tried it and I've liked it
 ?so much that I do it a couple of hours every day.  I'm careful though. 
 ?If my daughter saw me talking to an empty chair, she'd either 
 ?have a nervous breakdown or send me off to the funny farm."" 
 ? 
 ?The minister was deeply moved by the story and encouraged the 
  old man to continue on the  journey.  ?Then he prayed with him, 
  anointed him with oil, and  returned to the church. Two nights later 
  the daughter called to  tell the minister  that her daddy had died 
  that afternoon. 

  ""Did  he die in peace?"" he asked. 
 
 ?""Yes, when I  left the house about two o' clock, he called me over to 
  his  bedside, told me he loved me and kissed me on the cheek.   
  When I  got back from the store an hour later, I found him dead. 
  ""But there was something strange about his death. Apparently, 
  just  before Daddy died, he leaned over and rested his head on 
  the chair beside the bed. What do you make of ?that?"" 
  ? 
 ?The minister wiped a tear from his eye and said,  ""I wish we could all go 
like that."" 
 ? 
 ?Just ?send this to  four people and do not break this, please. Prayer is 
  one of the  best free gifts we receive. There is no cost but a lot of  
rewards. 
 ? 
 ?""I never said it would be easy,  I only said it would be worth it"""

What's going on strangers??  Haven't heard from you guys in a while,  I guess 
we are all busy in our own little world.  Just wanted to say hello and see 
how yall were doing.  I also have some SPECIAL NEWS I wanted to share with 
you guys.  Here it goes..........



My first and BIGGEST news is that Anthony and I are expecting, yes a BABY!  
I'm 3 1/2 months and due July.  So is everyone SHOCKED!  Sorry for delay in 
telling you guys but I had a little accident so I wanted to make sure 
everything was okay!  Everything is fine!  My second news is that we are also 
in the process of buying a house so hopefully that will turn out okay.  Now 
I'm realizing how much of a headache it is to do all this paper work and all 
the closing costs that add up.  If you homeowners have any tips for me pass 
them on I need all the help I can get.        I'll stop here cause I'm sure 
you guys don't have time to do all this reading.  Just wanted to share some 
of my good news with all of you. 

Love, 
Melissa"

I will be coordinating with IT to ensure our migration to Outlook 2000 (GEM 
Project) happens smoothly and successfully.  I will inform you of information 
needed or timelines as I am made aware of them.  I'm in the process of 
providing them the initial information for our group.  After they receive it 
they will send me more details of how the process will take place and how 
long it will take to complete.  Please hold your questions until you receive 
that email.  If you have something you would like to address after you 
receive that e mail we will proceed as needed.

The first step for you, is to go through your lotus notes and start wiping 
out personal e mails and data that can be converted to a spreadsheet or word 
document.  We will have access to our lotus notes for a period of time (will 
have to get specifics from IT) but will not be sending or receiving e mails 
through the Lotus Notes Database once we have migrated over. 

Again, I will keep you posted as I receive information.  Thank you for your 
patience and cooperation in advance.

There was plenty of generation online for Sat. and Sun.  FE offered out 150 
mw's at $38 for a 16-hr. schedule for Monday.  No one had any interest at 
this price level.  There were no decent bids for saturday or sunday.   On 
saturday we moved  Ecar power down to Florida most of the day until TLR's 
were called.  On sunday during the evening peak Soco was on the bid($25), 
unfortunately TLR's prevented any energy from moving into Serc.  Most 
utilities will be sellers in the morning.

   SAT 16 hour average:  BID  $ 10.5   OFFER $ 26.9
   SUN 16 hour average:  BID  $  9.9  OFFER $ 17.2 


MAIN

 TLR's were abundant over the weekend.  CE, Ameren and other Main members 
were not able to send power into Serc or Frcc.  No legitimate bids while 
sellers had plenty of power.  Ameren was an island due to TLR's.  CE will be 
selling hourly all day Monday.  CE quoted an offer of $36 for a 16-hr 
schedule, for he 7 they quoted $12, with no bids to move it to.   Ameren will 
also be selling hourly if TLR's do not kick in.  No one had any interest in 
picking up a preschedule. 


 MAIN  FRI 16 hour average:  BID  $ 19.7   OFFER $ 30.4

Prices for the evening peak were offered out in the high teens to low 
twenties.  Bids were in the low teens.  TLR's were called thus preventing 
power from moving down to the south.  Off-peak prices were just as ugly with 
offers in the mid teens and no one showing a bid.  PJM called for min. gen. 
for a couple of hours.  After he 23 LGEE began sending 365 mw's to TVA.  This 
was the only movement of power in Ecar per Oasis.  For Tuesday everyone will 
have hourly power to sell.  FE will have 200-300 mw's to move each hour.  No 
one had much interest in picking up a pre-schedule for Tuesday. 



MAIN

Prices in Main were a little lower than in Ecar.  Bids for the evening peak 
were in the low teens and for off peak bids were in the single digit's.  CE, 
Ameren, IP and Wepco will have hourly power to sell.  ALT bought 150 mw's on 
a preschedule for Tuesday.  They bought this preschedule from their neighbors 
in the low 20's.  They will be looking to pick up another 50 mw's beginning 
he 9.  They will be looking to pay in the low 20's again.  This was the only 
bid for a preschedule in Main."

 For the evening peak prices remained strong.  TLR's prevented any movement 
of power into Florida during the evening peak.  TVA was the culprit in 
calling for TLR's.  TLR's were not called off until He  22.  For He 23 and He 
24 we sold 100mw's  to FPL at $41 and $36.  For HE 1 they bought directly 
from their neighbors at $18.  FPC, JEA and TECO were flat for these hours.  
For hours 2-6 FPL was a  $15 bid.  Due to limited hourly trans. available and 
the likelihood of TLR's a short schedule sale to Florida was not possible.    
 


SERC

TLR's were still in place for the evening peak thus limiting the import of 
power into SERC from the North.  The eveving peak saw all of SOCO interfaces 
showing -0-.  Starting HE 23  the EES side of SOCO opened up with 150 mw's.  
We were able to move Cajn power into Florida staring HE 23.  We offered SOCO 
$45 for this hour and they passed on it.  Off-peak offers were in the low 
20's.  SOCO was a $16 bid.  No one would show a decent  bid for a 16-hr 
preschedule.  The guys on shift would not show a bid or offer for a 16-hr 
preschedule.  They will wait until the afternoon to start buying.  Most of 
the night guys in SERC believe that TLR's will once again be called by TVA 
starting in the afternoon."

Evening peak prices remained strong until he 22.  OPC was a low 40's bid 
untill he 22.  We prescheduled 100 mw's to SOCO for $95 from he 20-22.  SCEG, 
DUKE  and SC were low 40's bids for the evening peak.  CPL was the only 
reasonable offer at $60.   TLR's prevented any new schedules from being 
started until he 23.    Off- peak bids were in the low to mid teen's.  SOCO 
was buying $15 from their neighbor's.  Vepco offered out $14.00 into TVA or 
into EES for off-peak.  This power ended up being sold to EES.  EES would not 
show us a bid for off-peak.   For Wednesday SOCO and SCEG will be buying 
hourly after the morning peak.  Duke and Vepco will be buying for economics.  
SOCO did not want to pre-schedule anything for Wednesday.

Bids were not very strong in Florida for the evening peak.   Rain helped the 
Florida utilities cover their loads.  For he 21-22 TAL, FPL and FPC were mid 
40's to mid 50's bids for the evening peak.  The only offer for the evening 
peak was a $100 offer from FPL.   For off-peak, bids were in the mid teens, 
there was no real interest in buying off-peak.   FPC and FP&L  will wait 
until mid morning to look for preschedules.

,07/20/2000,,juan.hernandez@enron.com,wayne.herndon@enron.com,,,"TLR's were again the story in SERC.  TLR's were not lifted until 1:00 a.m.  
We could not move anything from ECAR into SERC.  This was not the case for 
the AEP marketers, TVA trans. made a mistake by allowing a new schedule to be 
started with an AEP to SOCO sink.  TVA admitted this mistake to us.   OPC and 
SOCO were the strongest bid across the evening peak.  OPC was an $80 bid for 
he 20.  SOCO was a $60 bid across the evening peak.  SCEG was the only other 
bid during the evenng peak and he was trying to buy under his gas units.  
VEPCO was a $50 offer, unfortunately, VEPCO was a bad source for SOCO and 
OPC.  For off-peak OPC was the strongest bid for he23 and 24.  We sold them 
$24 for he 24.  We also sold $15.50's to SOCO  for he 2-6.   CPL was the only 
 offer at $19.50.  SOCO had no offer for off-peak, they had to much 
maintenance to offer anything out.  For Thursday  SOCO, OPC and SCEG will 
again be buying hourly after the morning peak.  DUKE, CPL and VEPCO will have 
hourly to sell tomorrow.

A very quiet night in SERC.  Evening peak prices fell off hard due to rain 
covering  SOCO's control area.  OPC was the best bid for the evening peak he 
21-22($60-$70).  SOCO would not show a bid for the evening peak.  For he 
21-23 SOCO began to sell about 400mw's to SCEG, SC and GTC.  The TLR called 
by TVA on the Bowen-Sequoyah has not been re-called as of 3:00 a.m.  TVA has 
not been able to bring in power from the north.   TVA must be doing well 
generation wise since they did not import power from its neighbors.  For

for the evening peak and the off-peak.   With TLR's expected again for

north.  They had bought power from San Antonio and Reliant which ended up 
being cut.  We ended up buying from CSW(wtu-$48) thinking this was north 
enough.  The ISO killed the deal.  They told us that as of Friday WTU will

,03/15/2001,,enron.announcements@enron.com,all.states@enron.com,,A new way to pay!,"Rick Causey recently announced a new online purchase and payment tool called 
iBuyit.  One of the special iBuyit components is an automated accounts 
payable feature that will improve the way you code and approve invoices. 

As of May 1, you will be able to access iBuyit Payables and
? choose budget codes from simple drop down menus
? receive e-mail when you have an invoice that needs to be coded and/or 
approved; and
? view an electronic image of the actual invoice

These improvements will help you assign codes more accurately and will reduce 
the time you spend processing invoices for payment.  The AP tool will also 
begin to eliminate the need for coding sheets or other paper information 
currently in use.  

This tool will provide us the opportunity to transition our Houston-based AP 
processing functions to a third party, SourceNet Solutions.  This transition 
is expected to be completed by August 2001.

You will hear more about the iBuyit initiative, features of the AP tool and 
training opportunities in the coming weeks.  Please contact your AP 
representative if you have any questions."

PJM is implementing a pilot program effective 0900 Thursday, December 28, 
2000. 

PJM is reducing the time required to request a change to an existing 
interchange transaction and purchase hourly transmission from 30 to 20 
minutes. 
Changes to interchange transactions will continue to be guaranteed with 30 
minutes notice. 
Changes will be accommodated with 20 minutes notice on a best effort basis. 
To accommodate the reduced notification time for interchange transactions, 
transactions without a linked NERC Tag will not be approved until a Tag is 
linked. Transactions that remain untagged 20 minutes prior to the transaction 
start time will be rejected. As always, transactions without a NERC Tag will 
hold ramp."

reliability during an outage with any one upstream provider. Unfortunately 
during this upgrade some of you were unable to

want to re-confirm that we try to never perform
any upgrades or maintenance during business hours.  FriedWire is also very 
pleased to announce that our entire system will
be upgraded in the next 30-days.  We have entered into a contract with Verado 
(formerly Firstworld) to migrate all of our
systems to their facility in Denver, Colorado.  With this migration we should 
see increased performance and reliability in
all of our systems.

,03/15/2001,,bill@friedwire.com,juan.hernandez@enron.com,,New Traffic Report version is released!!,"Dear juan,

FriedWire Inc has just released a new version of our Traffic Report.  Below 
is a snapshot of the new content:


NEW EMERGENCY MAPS-
We have added more than a hundred transmission elements (e.g. flowgates, 
transformers, power plants now totaling over 500!)
to our geographic representation of TLR's and other market-moving 
announcements.  To handle the increased resolution, we
have developed two new maps that replace the Emergency Constraints map, 
providing even more information for users to easily
digest in a color-coded, geographic snapshot.

Now, the Emergency (TLR) map shows the entire U.S. with small white dots in 
the background that represent all the flowgates
that are experiencing satisfactory conditions.  Overlaid are larger 
color-coded dots signaling the flowgates that have some
TLR level associated with them.  The new TLR map will have greater 
differentiation than the old one, with TLR levels from 1
to 6 represented.  When you click on one of the colored dots, you will see 
the name of the element and the TLR level in a
pop-up box.  The Market Notices map still has the regions colored when there 
is a market notice associated with them.  You
can click on a region and get a pop-up text box with the full text of the 
regional notice.


CALIFORNIA ISO-
We have added the ability to look at the system frequency for a day or an 
hour in the Frequency Monitoring in WSCC
(deviation from 60Hz) area of the System Summary page.

We have also added Generator Outages in California.  This lists all generator 
outages, including unplanned and planned, with
additional data fields detailing the name, owner, and zone of curtailed units 
plus the amount of capacity affected.


POWER FLOWS-
We now have more information displayed on the time series flow graph for each 
intertie on the Intertie Profile screen under
the Power Flows tab.

When a transmission line or intertie is affected by a TLR request, the black 
line on the time series graph (which represents
flow under normal conditions) is overlaid with a bold color corresponding to 
what TLR the line is experiencing.  Thus, the
historical context provided by the graph for intertie flow over the past day, 
week, month, or year, is even more intuitive
and informational with the help of easy-to-read color coding, reflecting TLR 
history as far back as a year.  If you want
more information about the intertie's past TLR's, simply scroll down to the 
history of market notices associated with that
physical transmission element.

We have also revisited the ways in which flow direction can be interpreted.  
We now provide a clear picture of the magnitude
AND direction of power.

1.)  In the power flow time series graph, the limit of the intertie and the 
flow on the intertie will now always show
consistent signs.

2.)  In the Power Flow Data table above the graph, the Flow MW will always 
appear positive.  This flow magnitude is in fact,
the absolute value of the flow.  The Flow Direction, the left-most data field 
on this row, is dynamic.  If the flow changes
directions, the text within that field will be modified accordingly.

3.)  The third place to get an immediate and intuitive sense of direction of 
power flow is in the map to the left of the
graph on the Intertie Profile.  The arrow will always correspond to real-time 
direction of power flow.

Look forward to a major new release soon.  We'll soon be rolling out links to 
all OASIS nodes in our ATC tab, our new
flowgate impact calculator and more.

Take Care,

Take 60 seconds & give this a shot! Let's just see if Satan stops this one.

All you do is -

1) Simply say a small prayer for the person who sent you this, (Father God, 
bless this person in whatever it is that You know he or she may be needing 
this day!)

2)Then send it on to five other people.

Within hours five people have prayed for you, and you caused a multitude of 
people to pray to God for other people. Then sit back and watch the power of 
God work in your life for doing the thing that you know He loves.

Please send it back to me, so that I can also pray for you!!!"

I've updated the transmission rates table for May - here is the location:

M:\Electric\East Volume Mgmt\Transmission\Transmission Rates

If there is a better spot for this to make it more accessible just let me 
know and I can put a copy of it whereever.

Couple of other trends I've noticed that hopefully can be corrected...

First Energy transmission is now and has been for a while under the 
counterparty American Transmission Systems, Inc. (ATSI)
Duke transmission should be under the Duke counterparty Duke Electric 
Transmission (DUKEELETRA)
Georgia's ancillary service charges have changed although their website has 
not be updated - price changed from $2.57 to $2.49

Please pass this along to the rest of the group, if any of you have any 
questions or suggestions - don't hesitate to call.

Your Date of Migration is: May 24th

YOU WILL BE UNABLE TO SEND E-MAIL unless you take the following action:
Please go through your Notes email and clean out as many old/un-needed email 
items as possible BEFORE your date of migration.? After you are migrated to 
Outlook you will only be allocated 100MB of total Mailbox space.?? If more 
than this amount of data is migrated to Outlook YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SEND 
E-MAIL until it is below the 100MB limit.? Cleaning up your Notes email now 
will prevent this from happening to YOU.

Enron,s messaging platform is migrating from Lotus Notes to Microsoft Outlook 
2000 worldwide.  You will be accessing Outlook for all of your email 
functions. 

WHY IS ENRON MIGRATING TO OUTLOOK 2000?

Many factors contributed to the decision to migrate from Lotus Notes to 
Microsoft Exchange/Outlook.  The most prominent factors were:

? Significant advantages to moving to a product that is more integrated with 
current Enron apps (Windows 2000, Office and Internet Explorer)
? More efficient Shared PC and Roaming User features
? Improved support and integration for Palm/CE devices
? Instant Messaging capabilities

WHAT IS BEING MIGRATED TO OUTLOOK 2000?

? Email Messages.  From the date of your scheduled migration, the last (30) 
thirty days of your Email will be converted for use in Outlook.
? All your folders in Notes you use to store email messages in.
? To Do Items
? Journal Items
? Calendar Entries dating from (1) one year in the past to (10) ten years in 
the future will be converted.
? Address Books, but NOT your Distribution Lists that you created.  You will 
need to re-create these in Outlook.

REASONS FOR USING OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

1. Once your mailbox has been migrated from Notes to Outlook, the Outlook 
client will be configured on your computer.
After migration of your mailbox, you will not be able to send or recieve mail 
via Notes, and you will not be able to start using Outlook until it is 
configured by the Outlook Migration team the morning after your mailbox is 
migrated.  During this period, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) via your 
web browser (Internet Explorer 5.0) to read and send mail.

PLEASE NOTE:  Your calendar entries, personal address book, journals, and 
To-Do entries imported from Notes will not be available until the Outlook 
client is configured on your desktop.

2. Remote access to your mailbox.
After your Outlook client is configured, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) 
for remote access to your mailbox.

PLEASE NOTE:  At this time, the OWA client is only accessible while 
connecting to the Enron network (LAN).  There are future plans to make OWA 
available from your home or when traveling abroad.

HOW TO ACCESS OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

Launch Internet Explorer 5.0, and in the address window type:  
http://nahou-msowa01p/exchange/john.doe

Substitute ""john.doe"" with your first and last name, then click ENTER.  You 
will be prompted with a sign in box as shown below.  Type in ""corp/your user 
id"" for the user name and your NT password to logon to OWA and click OK.  You 
will now be able to view your mailbox.

 

PLEASE NOTE:  There are some subtle differences in the functionality between 
the Outlook and OWA clients.  You will not be able to do many of the things 
in OWA that you can do in Outlook.  Below is a brief list of *some* of the 
functions NOT available via OWA:

Features NOT available using OWA:

-  Tasks
-  Journal
-  Spell Checker
-  Offline Use
-  Printing Templates
-  Reminders
-  Timed Delivery
-  Expiration
-  Outlook Rules
-  Voting, Message Flags and Message Recall
-  Sharing Contacts with others
-  Task Delegation
-  Direct Resource Booking
-  Personal Distribution Lists

QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS?

If you have questions or concerns using the OWA client, please contact the 
Outlook 2000 question and answer Mailbox at:

 Outlook.2000@enron.com

Otherwise, you may contact the Resolution Center at:

 713-853-1411

Employee Referral Program.

 This new site will help you to help Enron find the talent it needs. 
Referrals are one of the best sources of talent for Enron in terms of quality 
and fit with Enron's culture. We have found that referrals stay with the 
company longer and adapt faster than those hired through other sources. This 
site will help us run a world-class employee referral program with less work 
and better results. 

 There are also incentives for you. If you refer a candidate who is hired, 
you could be eligible to receive a cash reward of up to $5,000.

 So help someone accelerate their career, make yourself some money, and help 
us realize our mission of being the World's No. 1 Company.

 Check out the site - http://enron.referrals.com/promo.asp - let us know what 
you think -- we want to hear from you. This application should make referring 
easier for you so if you have suggestions that would enhance the program, 
send us an e-mail (Referral.Station@enron.com) or contact the Referral 
Station at (713) 345-3254, option 2.

You know you are at a SERIOUS MEXICAN BIRTHDAY  PARTY IF:
?
1.??? Some of the guests didn't  bring a gift, but brought extra uninvited 
kids.
2.??? When the cake says ""Happy  Birthday Mijo"" instead of the child's real 
name.
3.??? The party is at Chuck E.  Cheese, but they brought their own food, 
cake, and a pinata.
4.??? It's a party, but there are  more grown-ups than children.
5.??? It's ""Mijo's"" 1st Birthday and  the party food is carne asada, arroz 
con frijoles puercos, y 10 cases of  beer.
6.??? For entertainment, instead of  playing pin the tail on the donkey, 
there is usually a televised baseball,  football game, or a live fight.
7.??? They don't sing Happy  Birthday, instead everyone is salsa dancing.
8.??? The party was over at 5:00,  it's 10:00 and the party is just starting.
9.??? You find out from Abuela that  Abuelo is taking viagra.
10.??? The host calls someone who's  on their way and tells them to stop and 
get some tortillas and ice.
11.??? The guests start arriving and  the hostess disappears to get ready.
12.??? You hear someone go up to the  birthday child and say ""Mira, tan cute!""
13.??? Someone else says? ""I'm  going to have to get you something next week 
when I get paid.
14.??? The party is Saturday, and  you get a call from the hostess Friday 
night saying, ""I'm giving Mijo a birthday  party tomorrow at 3:00.""
15.??? Some guests bring gifts that  are still in the store bag unwrapped.
16.??? There always seems to be more  family than friends at the party.
17.??? You have the party over at  your's brother's because he bought a new 
house and he has a pool.
18.??? The cake didn't come from the  store; it came from the mother of the 
comadre of your friend's sister who makes  really good cakes.
19.??? You are told you have to save  your plate and fork you ate your food 
with, so you can eat you  cake.
20.??? Someone calls and says they  can't make it, but asks that you save 
them some cake.
21.??? Guests are wrapping up cake  to take to Madre, Tio, Abuela, Chata y el 
Junior.
22.??? The party music is coming  from a small boom box.
23.??? The birthday child is dressed  from head to toe in Tommy.
24.??? The birthday baby's Daddy  comes to the party and brings the kid he 
had before and after the Birthday  Baby.
25.??? It's ""Mijo's"" party, but  since his cousin Madonna is there and her 
birthday is in a few days, it becomes  Mijo's and Madonna's party.

		Internet Tip of the Day
		Monday October 30, 2000
		
		Telecommuting  
		
		It's Monday, and you probably wish you didn't have to go to work (or school 
-- we all know it's work, too). Well, maybe the Internet can't help you this 
morning, but in the near future you might get a break! One of the greatest 
things about the Net is the way it lets lots of people do their work wherever 
there happens to be a computer terminal -- like at home. As more and more 
jobs become tied to the Web, more and more people are able to cut themselves 
loose from the office. Lots of employers are testing work-at-home programs, 
and many already offer telecommuting options. It's a great deal for parents 
and caregivers. It means you don't have to miss work while you wait for the 
plumber to come sometime between 9 AM and 5 PM (as we all know, if you're not 
there, he comes at 9:01. If you wait all day, he comes at 4:52 PM). It 
reduces absenteeism, too -- no need to take a ""mental health day"" when you're 
feeling too burned out to go in. No need to de! cide if you're ""sick enough"" 
to stay home -- and no need to breed resentment in your co-workers by 
bringing your germs to work. You can work in your pajamas. You have access to 
your own ""facilities."" You don't need to go out for lunch. Is it snowing too 
hard to come to work? Put another log on the fire! Then log on and get to 
work. Life can be good.

,12/13/2000,,enron.announcements@enron.com,all.worldwide@enron.com,,Succession Plan,"It is my great pleasure to announce that the Board has accepted my 
recommendation to appoint Jeff Skilling as chief executive officer, effective 
at the time of their next board meeting on February 12, 2001.  Jeff will also 
retain his duties as president and chief operating officer.  I will continue 
as chairman of the Board and will remain at Enron, working with Jeff on the 
strategic direction of the company and our day-to-day global operations.

Jeff will assume the role at a time when the company is hitting on all 
cylinders and is positioned for phenomenal growth.  He is clearly ready for 
the job, and after 15 years as CEO of this great company, I,m ready for a 
somewhat different role.

Our succession plan has been clear for some time.  This has afforded Jeff and 
me the freedom to combine our strengths toward building a company that 
continues to exceed everyone,s expectations, including our own.  We look 
forward to furthering that relationship as Jeff expands his role.

There are no plans for any other changes in our management team nor broad 
shifts in strategy and direction.

Please join me in congratulating Jeff.  I look forward to a great 2001."

,12/12/2000,,enron.announcements@enron.com,all.states@enron.com,,Improved Process for Engaging Temporary Workers,"As you are aware, Enron utilizes temporary staffing services to satisfy 
staffing requirements throughout the company.  For the past several months, a 
project team, representing Enron,s temporary staffing users, have researched 
and evaluated alternative Managed Services programs to determine which source 
would best meet our current and future needs in terms of quality, performance 
and cost containment objectives.  The Business Unit Implementation Project 
Team members are: 

Laurie Koenig, Operations Management, EES
Carolyn Vigne, Administration, EE&CC
Linda Martin, Accounting & Accounts Payable, Corporate
Beverly Stephens, Administration, ENA
Norma Hasenjager, Human Resources, ET&S
Peggy McCurley, Administration, Networks
Jane Ellen Weaver, Enron Broadband Services
Paulette Obrecht, Legal, Corporate
George Weber, GSS

In addition, Eric Merten (EBS), Kathy Cook (EE&CC), Carolyn Gilley (ENA), 
Larry Dallman (Corp/AP), and Diane Eckels (GSS) were active members of the 
Selection Project Team.

As a result of the team,s efforts, we are pleased to announce the beginning 
of a strategic alliance with CORESTAFF,s Managed Services Group.  This group 
will function as a vendor-neutral management entity overseeing all staffing 
vendors in the program scope. They will also provide a web based online 
technology tool that will enhance the ordering and reporting capabilities.  
The goal of our alliance with CORESTAFF is to make obtaining a temporary 
worker with the right skills and experience easier while protecting the best 
interests of the organization. 

We plan to implement Phase I of this improvement effective January 2, 2001.  
This Phase I of the implementation will encompass administrative/clerical 
temporary workers at the Houston locations only. If you currently have 
administrative/clerical temporary workers in your department, the enhancement 
will not affect their position. In an effort to preserve relationships, all 
current staffing vendors will be invited to participate in this enhanced 
program.  CORESTAFF shares our commitment to minimize any disruptions in 
service during this transition. 
 
We expect to incorporate the administrative/clerical workers in Omaha, 
Seattle and Portland in Phase II, which is scheduled for February, 2001.  The 
scope and timing of any additional phases will be determined after these two 
phases have been completed.

Realizing the impact that the temporary workforce has in business today, we 
selected CORESTAFF,s Managed Services Group based on their exceptional 
management team, commitment to quality service, and creative solutions to our 
staffing needs.  The relationship promises to offer Enron a cost effective 
and simple means for obtaining temporary employees.

In the coming weeks, Enron and CORESTAFF,s Managed Services Group will be 
communicating to Enron,s administrative/clerical temporary staffing vendors 
about the new process.  

There are many benefits to this new Managed Services program, which are 
outlined on the attached page.  More details on how to utilize CORESTAFF,s 
Managed Services program will be announced soon and meetings will be 
scheduled to demonstrate the reporting system and to meet the Managed 
Services team.

What is Managed Services?

CORESTAFF,s Managed Services program includes:

? Vendor-neutral management model
? Equal distribution of staffing orders to all staffing partners
? Web-based application with online ordering, data capture and customized 
reporting
? Benchmarking and performance measurement for continuous improvement
? Methodologies for accurate skill-matching and fulfillment efficiencies 

Key Benefits

? More vendors working on each order from the outset ) faster access to 
available talent pools
? Standardized mark-ups and fees to manage costs more effectively
? Online access to requisition status for users 
? Robust databases offering managers enhanced tracking and reporting of 
temporary usage and expenditures
? Standard and customized reporting capabilities -- online
? Tenured, experienced Managed Services team on-site to assist users in

	[IMAGE] [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  [IMAGE][IMAGE]  [IMAGE][IMAGE] [IMAGE][IMAGE] [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  November 13, 2001  Updates on Enron / Dynegy Merger, SCE Rescue Plan and Muni Vote in San Francisco  By Will McNamara Director, Electric Industry Analysis  [Today's column includes analysis on three separate news items.]   EnronOnline and Dynegydirect to Merge   [News item from Energy Info Source] Online energy trading EnronOnline will merge with smaller rival Dynegydirect after its parent company Enron Corp. agreed to a $9-billion takeover by Dynegy Inc. The integration of the two platforms will take about six to nine months, Dynegy said. In the meantime, the two will continue to operate separately. On both EnronOnline and Dynegydirect, traders can only deal with Enron and Dynegy, respectively.     Analysis: This is the first step in what may ultimately be a challenging integration of the various businesses between Dynegy and Enron. Although the merger makes sense for both companies, especially considering Enron's financial instability and its limited options at this juncture, it must be acknowledged that the two companies have very different corporate cultures, and the process of conjoining those different cultures may be a major task. The companies have developed two distinct approaches to online trading, as illustrated by their independent electronic exchanges. Although it will be interesting to see how the separate exchanges become conjoined and assimilate their two separate customer accounts, one thing that EnronOnline and Dynegydirect  have in common is that they rely on principal-based transactions.   It is important to note that Enron gained the first-strike advantage when it developed EnronOnline, the first electronic-trading exchange, well ahead of its competitors. Dynegy later followed this trend and created Dynegydirect about a year later. The latest available information indicates that EnronOnline has recorded transactions that exceed $590 billion in notional value. Since its inception in November 2000, Dynegydirect has recorded $33 billion in notional transactions. Enron trades various commodities on EnronOnline, led by electricity and natural gas, but also including bandwidth and paper. EnronOnline is a proprietary trading exchange. In other words, in every transaction that takes place on EnronOnline, Enron participates as either a buyer or a seller.   Dynegydirect was launched in October 2000, a year after EnronOnline became operational. Dynegydirect is much smaller than EnronOnline, although it is growing. The exchange recorded nearly $10 billion in transactions in the third quarter. Like EnronOnline, Dynegydirect is also principal-based. In other words, Dynegy is a participant in all of the transactions, either as a buyer or a seller. Unlike EnronOnline, which is completely online, Dynegydirect allows customers to conduct their transactions with Dynegy over the telephone. It is important to note that Dynegy strategically became involved in two different kinds of online trading. The first is the proprietary, one-to-many format on Dynegydirect, in which Dynegy participates in all transactions as either a buyer or a seller. The second venue is an anonymous, many-to-many format in which Dynegy participates along with multiple buyers and sellers. This operation takes place on TradeSpark. Dynegy had previously invested $25 million in eSpeed, the trading systems developer that created the infrastructure on which TradeSpark operates.   As a whole, the online trading market appears to be riding the wave of a major growth spurt. A study conducted by AMR Research showed that 600 energy-trading exchanges existed in April 2000. This number grew to 1,500 by September 2001. A separate report conducted by Forrester Research indicates that online trading in wholesale markets increased 750 percent from 1999 to 2000. The same report projects that online trading volume will continue to grow, leaping from a $400-billion market in 2000 to a $3.6-trillion market in 2005. Without question, the combined force of Enron and Dynegy will gain a market edge in many sectors of the energy industry, including the online trading market.    SCE Allowed to Proceed with Rescue Plan   [News item from Energy Info Source] A federal judge on Nov. 9 refused to delay a settlement between Southern California Edison (SCE) and state regulators designed to allow the utility to recover $3.3 billion of its debts and to keep it from bankruptcy. U.S. District Judge Ronald Lew said delaying the deal, as requested by a consumer group, would risk harming the state's second-largest utility, its creditors and the public. Judge Lew, who approved the settlement on Oct. 5, called the arguments for a stay advanced by consumer group The Utility Reform Network (TURN) ""repetitive"" and ""without merit.""   Analysis: This is a victory for SCE in the painstaking process of establishing a rescue plan for the utility with the state of California. Two weeks ago, a federal appeals court had temporarily blocked a settlement between SCE and state power regulators that would keep electric rates at record highs for the next two years. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals granted TURN two weeks to argue against the settlement. The settlement would help SCE, the state's second-largest utility, pay more than half of its estimated $6-billion debt by continuing to charge Edison customers higher rates imposed last May. The judge's decision now has blocked any additional counter claims by TURN, at least on the current judicial level, and it appears that SCE is free to move forward with its CPUC-endorsed rescue plan.    It is important to note that the original settlement deal between SCE and the state of California emerged out of negotiations that had taken place between SCE and the CPUC in an effort to resolve previous litigation. SCE had sued state regulators at the CPUC after they refused to allow the utility to raise rates and recover billions of dollars it had spent buying power on behalf of customers at soaring prices in the wholesale market. SCE's lawsuit argued that the regulators broke federal law and unconstitutionally took its property by not letting it bill customers for the full cost of their electricity. At the present time, SCE's total debt is marked at about $6.35 billion in power procurement-related liabilities due to state law that prohibited it from recovering the high costs of wholesale electricity through retail electric rates. Under the agreement reached between SCE and the CPUC, SCE would be allowed to pay down about $3 billion of its back debt of $6.35 billion.   In exchange for being protected from bankruptcy proceedings, SCE agreed to a rate freeze and a promise by utility executives to not pay shareholders a dividend until the debt is paid off. SCE's rates were raised by approximately 42 percent in 2001 and will remain frozen through 2003 unless the utility pays off its debts sooner. In exchange, SCE agreed it would use cash on hand and any revenue beyond what it needs to cover operating expenses to pay off its old debts; pay no dividends on its common stock through 2003 or until its back debts are fully paid; and drop a lawsuit against state regulators claiming the CPUC had violated federal law by failing to raise retail rates to reflect the underlying cost of wholesale power. From its perspective, officials at Edison International (the parent company of SCE) expressed confidence that the settlement deal would allow the utility to accumulate enough cash and gain financing by the middle of the first fiscal quarter of 2002 to pay its debt to banks, bondholders and power generators.    Tally of Absentee Ballots Changes San Francisco Municipalization Vote   [News item from Reuters] Two ballot measures aimed at establishing a public power system in San Francisco and unplugging utility Pacific Gas & Electric Co. have gone down in defeat, officials said on Nov. 12.   Analysis: The tally of absentee ballots in the Nov. 6 municipalization vote in San Francisco changed at least part of the outcome in this election. As noted in a previous IssueAlert, Proposition I, which sought to set up a Municipal Utility District in San Francisco and neighboring Brisbane, was defeated. However, originally it was believed that the separate measure known as Proposition F, which would have established a Municipal Water and Power Agency in San Francisco alone, had passed by a slim margin. Upon counting the absentee ballots, the San Francisco Department of Elections announced that this measure was defeated by a scant 533 votes.     Obviously, Pacific Gas & Electric Co. is quite pleased with the revised outcome of this election. In response to the finalized vote, representatives from the utility said, ""This outcome affirms that there is no strong sentiment in favor of the takeover of PG&E's distribution system in San Francisco."" There may be some validity to this statement, considering that one could argue that with the bankruptcy of Pacific Gas & Electric and the recent California energy crisis, conditions could have favored a pro-municipalization vote, and yet the measure still failed. However, let's not forget that it was defeated by only 533 votes, which indicates that the issue regarding the establishment of a public power system in the area is far from over.    The defeat of the municipalization issue in San Francisco can be attributed to several factors. First, it must be acknowledged that PG?Corp., the parent company of bankrupt Pacific Gas & Electric, spent about $1 million on advertising to defeat the measure. However, arguably voters responded to claims by Pacific Gas & Electric Co. that the municipalization plan was unrealistic. The utility claimed that a (MUD) Municipal Utility would be ill-equipped to handle the complex electricity infrastructure that Pacific Gas & Electric has managed for years, and that a city-run bureaucracy would not be able to compete with big league energy players. In addition, the new MUD would have to purchase Pacific Gas & Electric's transmission assets and also buy wholesale power without the benefit of long-term contracts, which represent two hefty investments that would end up costing consumers in the long run.

,11/14/2001,,chairman.ken@enron.com,dl-ga-all_enron_worldwide1@enron.com,,Change of Control Provisions,"As many of you know, I have a provision in my employment contract which provides for a payment of $20 million per year for the remaining term of my contract in the event of a change of control of Enron.  The merger with Dynegy, or a similar transaction with any other company, would trigger this provision on closing.  Assuming the merger with Dynegy is closed within 6-9 months, as we expect, this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $60 million.

Many CEOs have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989.  But given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees, I have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment.  Initially, I thought I would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash.  However, after talking to a number of employees this afternoon, I have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment.  Therefore, at closing, I will receive no payments under this provision.

I know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face.  But please know that I will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of Enron's employees and shareholders.  I am still very proud of what we have built at Enron, and I want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore Enron to its rightful place in the energy industry.

Thank you."

(NYSE: DYN) agreed on Nov. 9 to acquire rival Enron Corp. (NYSE: ENE) for some $9 billion in stock, underlining the dramatic reversal of fortunes for the Houston-based energy trading giant that was valued last year at nearly $80 billion. Enron's stock fell sharply in the past month due to investors' concerns about murky transactions that sparked an investigation by U.S. regulators and damaging downgrades by credit rating agencies. The merged company will retain the Dynegy name. It will have annual revenues of more than $200 billion and assets worth $90 billion, including more than 22,000 megawatts of electricity generating capacity and 25,000 miles of natural-gas pipelines. It will be North America's biggest marketer and trader of natural gas and electricity, positions previously held by Enron.  Analysis: Well, it's now official. The announcement of what presumably will be the final chapter in the Enron saga came with much fanfare at the end of last week. It is indeed a dramatic end. Enron, the maverick and innovative company that has often been credited for literally creating deregulated markets in the energy industry, will no longer exist after what has been a very quick and unbelievable fall from grace over the last several months. Dynegy, the slow and methodical company that took a more traditional approach toward success, is making a stunning acquisition of its formal rival and locking in much of the industry market share of Enron. Can there be any doubt that this is the energy industry's manifestation of the tortoise and the hare parable? Enron has clearly lost the race to Dynegy, but is making a smart choice to be bought, considering its desperate circumstances and the unlikelihood of its regaining financial strength on its own. For Dynegy, this acquisition is a major win, as the combination will create the  biggest and strongest energy merchant in the world.   There are so many interesting dimensions to this mammoth deal. Before addressing some issues related to the approval of the deal, let's establish some of the key points of the merger agreement. There have been some mixed reports, but it is generally believed that Dynegy is buying Enron for about $10 a share, quite a steal considering that just over a year ago Enron was trading at close to $90 a share and had a market value of nearly $70 billion. Under terms of the agreement, Enron shareholders will receive 0.2685 Dynegy shares per share of Enron common stock. Dynegy's current stockholders (including ChevronTexaco Corp., which currently owns 27 percent of Dynegy) will own approximately 64 percent of the combined company, while Enron's stockholders will own approximately 36 percent of the combined company's stock at closing.   In addition, Dynegy will provide an immediate $1.5-billion asset-backed equity infusion into Enron to help the company with its current financial woes, followed by an additional infusion of $2.5 billion into the combined company by ChevronTexaco. Chuck Watson, chairman and CEO of Dynegy, will retain his position at the new company. Steve Bergstrom, president of Dynegy, and Rob Doty, chief financial officer, will retain their positions at the new company. It is not presently known what role, if any, Ken Lay, current CEO of Enron, will hold at the new company.   Of course, this acquisition could not have taken place if Enron had not fallen into a very vulnerable spot this year. Quite literally, Enron was pushed into this deal because it was running out of cash, its stock had tanked and its credit ratings were slashed to near junk levels, all within the last several weeks. Enron's decline over the course of 2001 has been the result of losses in its telecom sector, losses from its involvement in India, the departure of its former CEO Jeffrey Skilling, a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) investigation into some of its business practices, and lack of investor confidence about Enron's honesty in its financial reporting. This last point gained validity last week when Enron announced that it had overstated earnings by 20 percent over the last four years and investors should disregard the company's financial statements from 1997 through the first half of 2001. The restating of its earnings for the last five years sliced $591 million from Enron's reported profits. In addition, Enron revised its debt upward in each year from 1997 to 2000. At the end of 2000, Enron's debt was $10.86 billion, $628 million more than it had previously reported. By not reporting this debt earlier, Enron presumably was able to maintain a stronger credit rating than it would have had the accurate records been disclosed.   The key value for Dynegy in this acquisition is Enron's successful energy trading business. In addition, Dynegy could also find synergies in Enron's retail unit, Enron Energy Services and EnronOnline, the company's electronic trading unit. Dynegy has a similar trading site known as Dynegydirect, which was launched after Enron gained the first-strike advantage in this market space. Details are still emerging, but it would make sense if Dynegy opted to not purchase other units under Enron's business structure, such as the company's water and telecom businesses, which are losing money. Dynegy has its own telecom unit, which has also lost money this year, so it may not want to expand in this slow-growing sector at this time. Vivendi Environnement, a French company that has expanded into various lines of business, has reportedly expressed interest in the remaining subsidiaries of Azurix, Enron's struggling water subsidiary. Note that Enron sold Azurix North America to American Water Works.   The deal is subject to regulatory reviews and shareholder approval from Dynegy and Enron shareholders. Dynegy shareholder approval may be contingent upon any possible downgrades on its long-term debt that Dynegy could encounter with the purchase of Enron. At this juncture, it does not appear that Dynegy will be downgraded, but this is a fast-changing story and conditions could change abruptly. Financing the deal may also be an issue, even with the infusion of capital from ChevronTexaco. Dynegy reportedly has $3 billion worth of debt and has a market capitalization of $11.7 billion. Thus, Enron's own more substantial debt may be too significant for Dynegy to absorb, a concern that may cause Dynegy shareholders to veto the deal. This issue could be helped if Dynegy only elects to purchase some of Enron's assets and if there is some repair work done on Enron's balance sheets.   The issue of regulatory approval could be difficult, as the combination of the two huge companies may cause regulators to be concerned about market power and antitrust issues. The review of this merger will be unprecedented, considering that the wholesale natural-gas and electricity trading market is still fairly young. Certainly, a deal of this magnitude has not previously occurred in the deregulating energy industry. It is not presently clear which regulatory agency will be involved in the review, although the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department could all be involved. FERC would most likely become involved only if the acquisition includes the transfer of a physical asset, such as a pipeline. FERC may not become involved if the deal is structured solely as an exchange of stock. Not involving FERC would be more advantageous for Dynegy and Enron as the timeline for approval would be significantly shorter.   An issue that most likely will be at the top of the list of review items for regulators would be the extent to which the combination of Enron and Dynegy would hold market power in the natural-gas trading space, which could pre-empt market entry by other competitors. The combined company would be considerably larger than its nearest competitors. Scope and scale are considered the top competitive assets in the trading sector, and the combination of Dynegy and Enron will certainly have those assets in abundance. It will fall on regulators to determine if the combined company is so large that it precludes other competitors from emerging into the same space.   To say that this deal is a sweet victory for Chuck Watson is an understatement. The two rival companies followed very different paths to success. Enron, under the leadership of Jeffrey Skilling in particular, espoused an unorthodox belief that the company did not need to own physical assets in order to achieve success in the energy-trading space. Dynegy, on the other hand, approached the market from the opposite perspective, and diligently acquired diverse generation assets across the United States and internationally to support its trading operation. Up until the start of 2001, it appeared that Enron's strategy was the more successful of the two. Enron, with $100 billion in revenues and $1 billion in profits in 2000, ranked fifth on Fortune 500's list of largest U.S. companies. In contrast, Dynegy ranked 54 on the same list and had $29 billion in revenues and $500 million in earnings. However, 2000 turned out to be Dynegy's year and the success continued into 2001, the very year that would bring Enron's downfall. Enron's problems culminated in $638 million in losses in the third quarter, after taking $1.01 billion in charges associated with several of its non-core businesses. Taken with the other factors plaguing the company, Enron became exceptionally vulnerable and prone to a takeover, which has now provided Dynegy with a strong gain.   The purchase of Enron will literally quadruple Dynegy's size and should immediately provide an accretive earnings contribution. Further, Dynegy claims that it expects a 15- to 20-percent annual earnings growth over the next three years following its planned acquisition of Enron. If it gains all of the necessary regulatory approvals, Dynegy will become the undisputed market leader in the energy industry, with annual revenues of $200 billion and $90 billion in assets. The company will have 22,000 MW of generating capacity, which moves its closer to the previously established goal of accumulating 70,000 MW by 2005. In other words, the combined company will dwarf any other competition in the trading sector and be considerably ahead of its nearest competitors such as Mirant or Duke Energy in terms of size, resources and assets.   Word of the acquisition caused Enron's shares to increase some, one of the few upward bumps that the company had experienced in the last few months. Shares of Enron rose 44 cents, or 5.2 percent, to $8.85 in mid-day trade on the New York Stock Exchange on Nov. 9. As of early morning trade on Nov. 12, Enron shares were priced at $9.40. Shares of Dynegy gained $2.24, or 5.8 percent, to $41 in early trade on the New York Stock Exchange.

	Not as many upsets this past weekend in the college and pro games. Among the games that were commonly missed were, in the college games, Auburn/Georgia and Iowa/Northwestern; in the pros, Green Bay/Chicago, Miami/Indianapolis, and Oakland/Seattle. 

	Going into tonight's game, we have 4 people still alive for the money. Larry Campbell, Dave Ryan, Kayne Coulter and Joe Quenet, all who missed 4 games.  Dave, Kayne and Joe picked Baltimore and Larry picked Tennessee. Therefore, if Tennessee wins, then Larry will win outright. If Baltimore wins tonight, then it will come down to total points scored. Dave picked 24 points, Kayne has 29 and Joe had 56. Dave will win with Baltimore and 26 or less points, Kayne will win with Baltimore and between 27 and 42 points, and Joe will win with Baltimore and 43 or more points. 

	We only had 22 entries this weekend, therefore the prize will be $66. This coming week's games will be handed out tomorrow and due Thursday afternoon, since I will be off this Friday. Here are the results from the games with the amount of games each person missed.

Enron now has an integrated, common financial, human resources, procurement, 
and project management system throughout the majority of Enron's businesses.  
By far Enron,s largest SAP implementation, this &go live8 added approximately 
8500 new users ) raising the total user population from Apollo and Beyond 
implementation efforts to over 13,000 Enron employees and contractors.  

A highlight of this implementation was the rollout of eHRonline, an 
intranet-based system that enables individuals to manage their personal 
information and time management activities plus view their pay information 
and benefit elections.  This new system gives the power and capability for 
managing your information to the person who knows the most about it ) YOU!

The Apollo and Beyond solution will yield savings of over $30 million per 
year plus provide increased speed and accuracy of information.  Once 
post-implementation efforts have been successfully completed, the focus will 
turn to system support, enhancements, and additional projects to help 
leverage Enron's SAP system for increased growth and profitability. 

Many thanks to the HR, financial, project and procurement communities for 
their efforts towards the vision of +One Enron,! 

For questions or assistance, please contact Enron,s SAP support organization

loads become operational.  During this interim period, Park 'n Ride services 
provided on an intra-day basis shall be priced incrementally higher than Park

El Paso Merchant Services needs to re-scrub their verbal offer to 
Transwestern of a $15 Million lump sum ""pre-payment"" option of fuel 
monetization for their combined 65,000 MMBtu/d of San Juan to California 
capacity.  El Paso did not take into consideration the different termination 
dates of the two contracts (25,000 MMBtu/d PG&E permanent release contract, 
and 40,000 MMBtu/d Gallup expansion contract) in their analysis.  A revised 
proposed lump sum payment offer is expected mid-next week.

compression to flow this gas into our high pressure line and has agreed to a 
volume commitment of 20,000 MMBtu/d for up to 2 years.  An added advantage is 
most of the volume would come from the constrained Atoka area which would 
allow Agave to increase deliveries to TW.

Caithness Corp.
Caithness has decided to move forward on their 1000 Mw generation project in 
Northwest Arizona.  The 2-phase project would initially consume 80,000 
MMBtu/d of gas.  The proposed location is 40 miles south of TW's line near 
Wickieup, AZ.  We are meeting with Caithness reps next week.  Projected 
in-service date for the plant is early 2002.

Level B cost estimates are being prepared.  Revenue / cost savings 
assumptions predict $500,000 annual revenue to support the expenditure.  Once 
installed, the project would give TW an additional 50,000 MMBtu/d capacity on 
the east end.  Financial evaluations will be done once the cost estimate is 
received."

Direct Energy owns a 27.5% stake in Energy America, whose remaining equity

the Direct Energy

OGE Energy Corp. said its Enogex Inc. subsidiary has closed on the sale of
several assets no longer considered vital to its core business. These assets
include interests in oil and gas-producing properties in Utah and three
natural gas-gathering pipeline systems in Oklahoma. Terms of the
transactions were not disclosed. Proceeds from the asset sales, totaling
about $14 million, will be used to pay down short-term debt associated with
Enogex's 1999 acquisition of Transok LLC.

In Utah, Enogex sold all of its interests in its oil and gas properties,
along with all related rights, equipment, real property, leases and
agreements. In Oklahoma, Enogex sold the Piedmont and El Reno systems in
Canadian County and the Fidelity gathering system in Oklahoma County,
including all gathering lines, compressors and equipment along with related
contracts and rights of way.

The Oklahoma sale was to Seminole Gas Co., a wholly owned subsidiary of

     The FERC Staff has issued a Draft Environmental Impact Statement
determining that construction of Guardian Pipeline would have limited
environmental impact and would be an environmentally acceptable
action, based on its proposed and other mitigation measures. The
Draft covers the environmental aspects of constructing and operating
the 149-mile Guardian Pipeline. FERC will take written public
comments on the Draft until August 28th, and will conduct four public
meetings along Guardian's route starting August 14th. It will
address
the comments before issuing a final Environmental Impact Statement on
the project. A final decision on the Guardian Pipeline expected early
next year. The Guardian Pipeline will transport volumes from
interconnections with Alliance, Northern Border, Midwestern Gas
Transmission, and NGPL at the Chicago hub to northern Illinois and
southern Wisconsin markets. The project will consist of a 25,000
horsepower of compression and 141 miles of 36 inch pipeline extending
from Joliet to the Ixonia, WI, with an additional 8.5 miles of 16
inch pipeline extending from the main Guardian line to near Eagle,

2:00 PM (CST) Jul 12, 2000
 
After submitting proof of market need in the form of newly signed precedent 
agreements 
for firm transportation capacity, the highly contested Independence Pipeline 
and related 
SupplyLink pipeline projects were approved by FERC this morning. The two 
projects 
have been pending at FERC for more than three years.

The FERC decision paves the way for more than 900 MMcf/d of new natural gas 
transportation capacity to be built between Chicago and the Leidy Hub in 
Pennsylvania. 
The ""tentative"" in-service date for the projects is November 2002. Their 
downstream 
partner, MarketLink, which was approved by FERC in April, is expected to be 
operating 
a year earlier, a Williams Cos. spokesman said.  Williams, Coastal, and 
National 
Fuel are sponsoring the three pipeline projects, which together represent an 
investment 
of about $1.5 billion.

The Commission approved the ""greenfield"" Independence project over 
significant 
opposition from landowners in Ohio and Pennsylvania, who recently said they 
were not 
convinced the new precedent agreements provided ""sufficient evidence"" of 
market 
support .  The agreements met FERC's requirement for the projects to have at 
least 35% 
of their total capacity subscribed by non-affiliates by June 26."

marketing/legal/regulatory to determine how we will implement this & define 
the system requirements. Here are some of my questions:

If we recall & the nomination is still in place, then how do we allocate? 
What are the allocation rules?
How do we track the volumes/contracts that have been recalled? Who will 
monitor this process? What type of process is needed to track recalls & 
transporter call volumes?
What is the timing for the recall notice? Can it occur after the gas day has 
started? Will we have partial day recalls?
Will the recall option & transporter put option carry over to the aquiring 
shipper? What system changes are needed for capacity release?
How do we require a shipper to take firm transport capacity? Will this have 
some type of OFO notice similar to EFBH that requires the shipper to nominate?
How will the invoice system be changed to handle the various option fee 
processes? Will we store this information at a contract level in CBS or in 
the rate system at a contract level? Who will load & monitor these fee 
options?
Do we need a new Rate Schedule?

Lindy, can you let me know when you are availble to start meeting on this new 
service so that I can create our system requirements document. I am availble 
July 24th, 25th, & 26th.

Summary:
The recently concluded 12th Session of the Subsidiary Bodies in Bonn, the 
next-to-last negotiating session before the details of the Kyoto Protocol are 
scheduled to be finalized in November, made little progress on key issues. 
But the meetings did serve to highlight divisions within the three 
negotiating blocks and identify the most contentious areas for future 
discussion.

Summary:
The retail energy industry and the Internet are becoming increasingly 
interlinked. The past 12 months have seen the formation of a wave of new 
retail energy businesses seeking ways to utilize the Internet to create a 
""new"" retail energy industry. The difference is that this ""new"" industry will 
invert the energy supply chain and be built from the demand side (customer 
end) back upstream. This fosters a new role for customers and their 
relationship with suppliers, an expansion in the number and types of products 
and services being offered, and a change in the composition of the companies 
involved in this segment. In this Private Report we analyze these new 
entrants, their business models, and the prospects for success in what to 
date has been a difficult marketplace.

Summary:
The opening of Brazil's upstream oil sector has taken another step forward 
this week following the successful ANP auction of 21 blocks. This bidding 
round comes one year after ANP's first round, held in June 1999. The bid was 
well subscribed by 44 companies that were qualified to participate and bid 
for the 10 onshore and 13 offshore blocks throughout nine basins in Brazil. 
Although the ANP collected lower participation fees than in the first round 
(US$9.0 million compared with US$9.8 million in the first round), the second 
round was generally considered a success.

Summary:
Brazil's power demand grew rapidly throughout the first quarter of 2000. 
February demand was 6.8 percent over February 1999 levels, and March demand 
grew a further 7.6 percent above the previous year. The industrial sector 
continued to lead the recovery with year-to-date demand growing 9.8 percent 
over 1999, and commercial sector demand growth remained strong at 7.5 percent 
over a similar period. As demand growth strengthened, hydro power generation 
increased while thermal generation levels declined steadily from a peak in 
January. Hydro stored energy levels had begun to decline in all regions by 
the end of April, signaling the end of the wet season. With rapidly 
increasing demand, particularly in the South and Southeast regions, Brazil 
could experience power shortages during the coming dry season if capacity 
additions that are currently scheduled to come online in the next several 
months are delayed.

Product Line: Latin American Energy
URL:
http://www.cera.com/client/la/alt/063000_16/la_alt_063000_16_ab.html

Summary:
Prices in the Argentine power market were significantly higher in May owing 
to the combination of continued low hydro output, strong demand growth, and 
periodic constraints on natural gas deliveries to power plants in the Buenos 
Aires region. Spot power prices (energy component only) averaged $18.24 per 
megawatt-hour (MWh) in May. Although average power prices declined from last 
year, price volatility increased, with several short-duration episodes of 
prices over $60 per MWh as gas unavailability in the Buenos Aires region 
forced several midcost units offline during peak hours. In June, prices are 
expected to continue strengthening to the $24-$28 per MWh range on average. 
Beyond June, price pressures are expected to remain negative as increasing 
hydro output, new and returning low-cost thermal capacity, and the end of gas 
constraints push average prices back toward $15 per MWh or below by August or 
September.

Summary:
The US gas market enters the month of June with prices at the highest level 
since deregulation. At the Henry Hub prices have surged to as high as $4.50 
per MMBtu--up from less than $3.00 per MMBtu during April. Behind this has 
been a building and serious shortfall of supply, the result of disappointing 
gas production levels and surging gas demand for power generation. The gap 
between these two forces has been met through storage inventories, with 
injections so far this spring running between 1.5 and 2.0 Bcf per day below 
last year's rate. The continued tension between these two forces will keep 
the pressure on prices this summer, and the need to inject gas into storage 
will price out increments of demand.

Summary:
Pressure remains extremely strong in the United States gas market as three 
factors--the increasing power generation demand, lower storage inventories, 
and US wellhead supply still struggling to rebound--call into question the 
ability to build storage to a level adequate for next winter. Prices are 
being supported also by concurrent strength in oil and liquids markets, 
making traditional alternatives to gas much more expensive than in recent 
years. In this environment intense competition between power generation 
demand and storage injections will continue throughout the summer--with 
pressure increasing into July as temperatures rise--with the result that gas 
will continue to price at the high levels necessary to discourage end-use 
demand. CERA expects a July average price of $4.45 per MMBtu.

Product Line: North American Gas

http://www.cera.com/client/nag/db/061500_18/nag_db_061500_18_ab.html

Summary:
As US supply declines and demand grows, current high gas prices are 
reinforced, but western Canadian gas supply growth appears to be faltering 
when it is needed most. Both transitory factors and enduring trends underlie 
the disappointing production growth results. The largely weather-related 
transitory factors have had a near-term impact on drilling and connection 
activity. The underlying trends have been developing slowly over time. More 
shallow gas wells have been drilled in the past three to four years and 
created a shift to higher average basin declines and lower average per well 
production rates. Thus more shallow wells are needed just to replace 
production. With a shift to more exploration and deeper drilling, higher 
supply growth rates are possible, but if that does not occur, other potential 
supply sources may step in. Significant Arctic reserves in the McKenzie Delta 
and the Alaskan North Slope are once again entering the spotlight. Coal bed 
methane has become a str!
ong source of US supply. Although now ignored in Canada, it may become a 
future source of Canadian gas.

Summary:
Fundamentals have taken center stage, as building demand pressure accompanies 
US supply declines. Storage inventories have been significantly reduced, and 
the pressure for storage injections is likely to intensify as we head into 
the summer months. Demand-driven growth continues, as completions of 
gas-fired power generation plants accelerate to a pace above 10,000 megawatts 
per year and economic growth stimulates electricity demand. The result is a 
higher-price playing field for natural gas, with the average Henry Hub price 
likely to reach $3.67 per MMBtu for 2000--its highest level since the 
development of spot markets.

Summary:
The stock market has been delivering an unsettling message to the utility 
industry. Traditionally undervalued in the market, the sector is trading at a 
historically wide 50 percent discount to Standard and Poor's S&P 500. The S&P 
Utility Index over the past 18 months gained only 5 percent, with huge gains 
by some energy companies offset by a 15 percent drop in stock price for 29 
electric utilities. Yet early this year, the SPU outpaced all other industry 
groups. How should constantly evolving utilities in this wide-open sector 
form a strategic plan to maximize shareholder value while achieving success? 
The value of electric utility merger and acquisition deals for 1999--a record 
$50 billion--was double the 1998 value. But are these choices ahead of the 
curve? And when will the market catch up? Three groups of new companies with 
distinctive strategies may provide clues to the new strategic landscape: 
multiservice and technology providers, superregionals, and global power and !
energy companies. Three other strategic choices are considered in evaluating 
responses to these challenges.

Summary:
While several regional power markets are likely to see a repeat of price 
spikes this summer, other markets are likely to see a reversal in price 
volatility as supply-demand balances improve dramatically. One way to 
interpret forward markets is as a consensus of market expectations. 
Therefore, forward prices for on-peak wholesale power reflect the common 
expectation that prices will spike as high as--or even higher than--in 1999. 
A significant disconnect exists between the forward market prices and market 
fundamentals for the upcoming summer in some regional markets.

gasoline-to-crude oil price differentials on both sides of the north Atlantic

this strength in margins is attributable to the convergence of three factors: 
very low inventories, tightening gasoline specifications, and legal 
uncertainty.

Summary:
As higher crude oil prices started to reduce the high product differentials 
to Brent and thus lower refinery margins, refiners attempted to prevent this 
situation from worsening by reducing throughputs. However, very tight markets 
for gasoline and to a lesser extent for automotive diesel helped to limit the 
fall in those products' values. Meanwhile, fuel oil discounts to crude oil 
widened in May, driving down simple/hydroskimming margins.

In recent weeks, the combination of lower primary products inventories and 
reductions in operations at some refineries has helped differentials to 
recover. This has pushed margins to above May's averages, although still 
below April's peaks.

Summary:
Refined products markets continue to display marked regional differences. In 
the Atlantic Basin, low gasoline inventories in both the United States and 
Europe, which resulted from many months of OPEC production restraint, 
continue to dominate the market, and gasoline differentials above crude are 
at their highest level in over ten years. Although signs are emerging of a 
possible correction in the North American market in the coming month, the 
2000 gasoline season will almost certainly be the strongest experienced by 
Atlantic Basin refiners in many years. In contrast, Asia Pacific spot 
refining margins were weak through most of June, until the recent accident at 
KPC's Mina al-Ahmadhi refinery prompted a quick strengthening in prompt 
Singapore margins. However, with ample unused refining capacity available 
east of Suez and the likelihood of a partial restart of the KPC refinery in 
July, CERA's outlook is for that strength to be of short duration.

Summary:
In the West, July typically marks the start of the summer cooling season and 
steadily rising power prices. CERA expect the West to be the only region in 
North America with a year-over-year increase in peak electricity demand. 
Power prices already established new record highs in June, suggesting that as 
demand reaches its peak in the coming months western power markets will 
continue to experience increased volatility compared with last year's levels. 
The convergence of higher gas prices, growing power demand, and reduced 
hydroelectric energy production compared with 1999 levels is pushing up 
western power prices. Greater utilization of gas-fired generators within the 
West has supported western differentials and contributed to high gas prices 
throughout North America. Western gas prices should continue to be strong, 
boosted by continuing increases in regional gas demand for power generation 
and pressure across North America to inject gas into storage in anticipation 
of summer !
power loads.

Summary:
OPEC's agreement to raise its production quota beginning July 1 by 708,000 
barrels per day to 25.4 million barrels per day is consistent with its 
strategy of restraining supply to maintain oil inventories at relatively low 
levels. The gain in supply is a short-term fix meant to alleviate political 
pressure for increased production and to push prices below $30 but keep them 
in a mid- to upper $20s range.

,07/14/2000,,enron.announcements@enron.com,all.employees@enron.com,,New Paycheck Information!,"Introducing your first SAP Paycheck!

This is the first payroll processed in SAP for all employees paid out of 
Corporate Payroll. You may notice some changes in the way information is 
reflected on your pay advice, the most common are itemized below.

What,s Different?
? Your +home, cost center will be displayed at the top of the pay advice. 
This is your department number as designated in the HR and financial modules 
of SAP.

? Any earnings descriptions that start with a +P, represent earning types 
reported in the prior period. For instance, if you reported vacation time for 
the July 1st-15th pay period, it will be reflected on your July 31st pay 
advice as +PVacation,.

? Flex dollars will appear on the earnings section of the pay advice instead 
of as a credit in the deduction section. The various benefit deductions will 
remain itemized in the deduction section.

? If you transfer between Enron companies during the year, your year)to-date 
totals will carry forward to the new company pay advice. Previously, the 
year-to-date totals started over when transferred to another company. This 
change will provide your total Enron earnings and deduction amounts on your 
pay advice throughout the year.  (Note that your W2 at the end of the year 
will reflect your earnings by company).

? For salaried employees, any reported exception time (e.g. vacation, sick 
day, etc.) will be reflected on the earnings section with hours only, the 
related dollar amount will be included in the +Salary, earnings type. 

? For any other information or further explanations regarding your payroll 
contact the Payroll Call Center at 713-345-5555



Payroll FAQ,s

My paycheck has a line called &other deductions8, what does that stand for?
There is a fixed amount of lines to print deductions on the paycheck.  For 
some employees, the number of deductions are more than we have room to 
print.  In this circumstance, the system totals all remaining deductions and 
prints them on one line ) titled &other deductions8.  The detail of all 
deductions can be viewed on the pay advice that is displayed on the intranet 
at eHRonline.enron.com.

What do the earnings or deduction codes on my paycheck mean?
These definitions are listed on the Payroll webpage located at 
hrweb.enron.com, select Enron Payroll  from the side index.

Why is my overtime not reflected on my paycheck?
Overtime is paid one pay period in arrears, therefore it will be reflected in 
the next pay period. For example, if you reported overtime for the 
July 1st )15th pay period, it will be reflected on your July 31st pay advice 
as +POvertime,.

What is the limit for Social Security (FICA)?
For year 2000 the limit is $4,724.40 on a wage base of $76,200. This limit is 
applied to each Enron payroll tax company. Therefore, if you transfer to 
another Enron company these limits will start over, however, the total amount 
withheld across all companies will be reflected on your paystub. Excess FICA 
will be credited to you by the IRS via your tax return.

What federal income tax rate is used for my bonus or when I exercise stock 
options?
There is a standard federal income tax rate of 28% for these earnings. This 
can be higher if the employee has completed a Supplemental Tax form 
requesting a higher rate (this form can be found at hrweb.enron.com , select 
Enron Payroll  from the side index)."

,07/17/2000,,enron.announcements@enron.com,enron.mail@enron.com,,PAC REMINDER,"Last month you received an email about enrolling in the Enron PAC.  The 
response has been positive.  
Thank you to those of you that have already enrolled or made a change to your 
current contribution!  
If you have not had an opportunity to visit the enrollment site, please 
consider taking a moment to do so.  The link to the website is at the end of 
this message.

 Some of you may have experienced problems launching the site or enrolling.  
We apologize for any trouble that you may have had.  The enrollment works 
best in either Internet Explorer or Netscape.  The most frequent problems 
were a result of the Lotus Notes web browser that many employees have 
installed as a default browser.  If this is your case, please copy and paste 
the link at the end of this message into either Internet Explorer or Netscape.

As a reminder - Following is the original message regarding the PAC 
enrollment:

Last year the Enron Political Action Committee (PAC) launched a campaign to 
become a ""million dollar PAC"".  Enron employees, who provide all of the 
funding for the PAC, responded and the Enron PAC reached its objective, 
becoming one of the largest corporate PACs.  This year we face a new 
challenge.  With the sale of EOG, the announced sale of PGE and normal 
employee turnover, we have lost a significant number of consistent 
contributors.  We are seeking your support.  If you are not a member, please 
join.  If you are a member, we hope you will consider increasing your 
contribution.

The Enron PAC is an essential tool in our effort to promote sound public 
policy.  Our PAC funds support local, state and federal candidates, of both 
parties, who support open markets, deregulation and customer choice.  Amounts 
contributed may be used to make political contributions in connection with 
federal and state elections and are subject to the limits of the Federal 
Election Campaign Act.  While our PAC has grown thanks to our employee 
contributions, it still generates just a fraction of the expenditures of 
those who oppose these ideals.

This year, as always, we face challenges and opportunities for every one of 
our businesses, including such issues as taxation and regulation of 
e-commerce, electric industry restructuring, regulation of derivatives, 
international trade and investment legislation, pipeline safety, local and 
state decisions affecting the siting and interconnection of power plants and 
a variety of environmental and tax issues.  Enron has a long and successful 
track record of supporting and advancing good public policy.  That track 
record depends on access to and regular communication with, decision makers.  
The PAC provides that access - - it shows policy makers that real voters care 
about what they are doing.

One of the best things about Enron is that we don,t just take things as they 
are.  We challenge the status quo.  We ask why.  We change things.  The PAC 
helps us do that.  We need you to help the PAC.  Sign up today ) and please 
consider the following contribution guidelines:

Manager    $500/year
Director     $750/year
Sr. Director/General Manager  $1,000/year
Vice President    $2,500/year
Sr. VP/Managing Director  $3,500/year
Executive Committee   $5,000/year

All contributions are voluntary and these guidelines are merely suggestions.  
You are free to contribute more or less than the guidelines suggested and 
Enron will not favor or disadvantage anyone by reason of the amount of their 
contribution or their decision not to contribute.  You may refuse to 
contribute without fear of reprisal.

Only U.S. citizens and resident-aliens living in the U.S. can contribute to 
the Enron PAC.  Amounts contributed may be used to make contributions in 
connection with federal and state elections and are subject to the 
limitations of the Federal Election Campaign Act.  The maximum contribution 
is $5,000 per year per individual.  An individual may not contribute more 
than $25,000 to all federal candidates and committees within a calendar 
year.  The law requires that Enron report name, address, employer and 
occupation for every person who contributes over $200/year.

No portion of any contribution is deductible as a charitable contribution for 
federal income tax purposes.

Thanks for your support!  Sign up now, or revise your current contribution

on Friday 7/21 for auction.  Strong markets out west indicate we should 
expect at or near max rates for the 3-month space and above average bids for 
the 12-month space.  We expect 6-12 bidders to actively participate.  A 
significant amount of time was spent by all team members working with IT 
personnel modifying the existing computer system to enable the auction to 
take place.  Thanks to all who made this come together.

Duke - We sold to Duke a firm transport agreement that will bring 20,000 
MMBtu/d of incremental supply to TW's east end at the Crawford receipt 
point.  The contract is a 2 year FT agreement beginning 8/1/00 for 20,000 
MMBtu/d from Crawford to Oasis (EOT - EOT) at $0.02 for year 1 and $0.0250 
for year two.

NGPL Winkler I/C - This interconnect was activated on Monday and began 
flowing gas its first week of operation.  We received a nomination of 40,000 
MMBtu to supply western gas demand.

Southwest Gas - We received the shipper executed agreement in our office this 
week!

August Gas Sale - 10,000 MMBtu/d was sold for the month of August at 
$4.10/MMBtu.

SoCal - Visited their office to discuss among several things the issue of the 
Needles Window.  SoCal's fluctuation of this set point has hampered TW's 
throughput for several months now.  They agreed to give Transwestern a chance 
to meet the 750,000 MMBtu/day.  The window has been 750,000 MMBtu/day and 
above since our visit and TW,s deliverability has not been a problem.  
Additionally, PG&E has raised their window to 300,000 MMBtu/d.  These two 
events combined allowed TW to deliver near-record throughput to California 
this week.  Thanks to everyone, including all Ops Team Members for helping 
make this happen.

PG&E - Met with Market Center personnel to discuss storage opportunities for 
both TW & PG&E.  They were interested in the idea of using TW,s Park'N Ride 
Service when their storage was allocated (a role reversal from when we 
initiated this program last year).  The Market Center and TW will continue to 
talk daily to pursue any storage opportunities that arise.

El Paso Merchant Services was provided a 10-year proposal for transportation 
in TW's East of Thoreau Area for a potential power plant load off of the 
PG&E-Intrastate line beginning November 2001.  Initial expected load 
requirements of 10-15,000 MMBtu/d may increase to 75,000/d during the term of 
the agreement.  This would be incremental supply into TW's east end.

Unbound Technology - Met with Unbound representatives again this week.  This 
wireless message provider gave us a draft proposal outlining potential 
services TW could use in an effort to be more proactive with customers 
regarding noms, confirmations, cut notices, and auction information.  We will 
review the draft internally and follow up with them next week with additional 
questions.

Cross-Functional Team Meeting - Attended the Operational Team meeting in 
Albuquerque this week.  We gave a short presentation on the status of various 
capital projects, proposed transport services, and overall market conditions 
that are impacting the pipeline.

between the parties.  The purpose of the meeting was to review the status of 
the Caithness Big Sandy Project and to establish the next steps for moving 
the project forward.

Caithness Corporation
Caithness Corp. is a privately held company based in New York with a variety 
of business interests.  The company is essentially a financial vehicle for 
private investors.  Their energy segment currently owns 1,200 MW of 
generation through renewable assets in California (geothermal at Coso, wind 
in Tehachapi and Palm Springs) and a gas fired plant in South Carolina 
jointly-owned by Florida Power & Light.

Big Sandy Project
The Big Sandy Project is a proposed power plant to be located near Wickieup, 
Arizona.  The project would be built in two phases- first phase would be 550 
MW, with a gas load of approx. 80,000 MMBtu/d, and phase 2 would add another 
170 MW for a total of 720 MW with a gas load of 120,000 MMBtu/d.

The proposed location of the plant is approximately 40 miles south of 
Transwestern's pipeline.  The take-off point on Transwestern would be at/near 
valve station #1008, approximately 15 miles downstream of compressor Station 
#1.  The current estimate includes an alignment that follows Arizona state 
highway 93 south to a location 2 miles southeast of Wickieup in the S/W 4 of 
Section 5, T15N, R12W, Mohave County, Arizona.  There is a 500 KV 
transmission line owned by WAPA that crosses the property.  This line is one 
of the principal electric transmission systems in the Southwest and extends 
from the Phoenix area to the Mead substation near Boulder City, NV.  I've 
included a WAPA map below which indicates this line.  Also, on the site is a 
water pipeline owned by the Cyprus Amax Bagdad mine.  Water for the plant 
will come from an encapusulated water table through deep wells.  They have 
currently dug the first two test wells, each capable of 500 cfm.  The power 
plant will require approximately 3,500 cfm of water.  In addition to the 
wells, the plant has several thousand-acre feet of water rights to surface 
water from the Big Sandy River.  The project may also purchase water from the 
Cyprus Bagdad water pipeline.

The chief geological feature of this area is the Big Sandy River and 
associated wash.  The highway 93 roadbed follows along the river.  The area 
includes rolling hills and is principally desert terrain, with some limited 
agricultural and ranching interests.  Wickieup is a very small town with an 
estimated population of 200.

Project Schedule
Gas Turbine(s) ordered Westinghouse-Seimens  May 2000
Submit Environmental Impact Statement (EIS)  August 2000
Arrange financing     December 2000
EIS approval      March 2001
Construction begins     April 2001
Testing begins      July 2002
Commercial Operation     November 2002

There are two lead agencies for purposes of the project's EIS- the Bureau of 
Land Management (BLM Kingman office) and the Western Area Power 
Administration (WAPA).  There is only one endangered/threatened species known 
to be present in the area.

Lateral Pipeline Alignment
The most critical path item is the alignment of the lateral pipeline.  The 
alignment (lateral pipeline route) must be included in the EIS to be filed 
next month.  Caithness has spoken preliminarily with the Arizona Department 
of Transportation (ADOT) and the agency is amenable to granting an easement 
for the pipeline.  The problem appears to be in the limited amount of right 
of way available.  Measured from the shoulder to the fenceline, there is only 
a 70 ft. right of way available for construction.  Typically, pipelines 
require a 100 ft. temporary construction easement and 50 ft. of permanent 
right of way.  Preliminary discussions indicate another problem with this 
alignment may be the roadway's routing within the wash of the riverbed.

If the highway 93 corridor is unsuitable for the pipeline, the second 
alternative appears to be running the pipeline down the adjacent N/S section 
line.  The problem with this approach is that as the line nears the site, the 
routing would have to contend with the river bed and wash areas, possibly 
necessitating deep burial and anchoring.  The other route would involve 
following along the WAPA electric transmission corridor.  The only issue 
there, aside from whether WAPA would permit the pipeline encroachment, is 
whether there are safety and/or corrosion concerns associated with a high 
pressure gas line located under a high voltage transmission system.

Other Preliminary Project Issues
There are other fundamental issues to address.  The original concept was to 
interconnect the proposed Transwestern lateral with El Paso's northern 
mainline and the yet-to-be-constructed Questar Southern Trails Pipeline, both 
of which lay adjacent to Transwestern's mainline.  Transwestern's original 
estimate to construct a 16"" lateral pipeline and meter station ($20.3MM) was 
based on the following specifications:

120 MMcf/d
450 psig delivery pressure,
900 psig inlet pressure

The meeting resulted in a revised set of specifications that now include a 
higher 550 psig minimum delivery pressure (new technology Westinghouse 
turbines).  In addition, our understanding is that EPNG's system operates at 
a pressure 100-150 psig lower than Transwestern's.  In order to accommodate 
EPNG deliveries and to account for the new higher minimum pressure, the 
design will likely change to a 20"" pipeline.

Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America (NGPL) continues to move through the 
recontracting 
process like a hot knife through butter. Since Kinder Morgan took over NGPL 
parent KN Energy 
last year, the interstate pipeline subsidiary has signed multiple agreements 
and contract 
extensions for gas transportation and storage with its major shippers in the 
Midwest, including 
another deal announced yesterday with Northern Indiana Public Service 
(NIPSCO). 

NGPL and NIPSCO signed a contract extending the terms of several firm 
transportation 
agreements totaling 295,100 MMBtu/d of capacity beginning Dec. 1, 2000 and 
Dec. 1, 2001 
and continuing through Nov. 30, 2002. They also extended the terms of two 
storage agreements 
totaling 10.5 Bcf of capacity beginning Dec. 1, 2000 and April 1, 2001 and 
continuing through 
March 31, 2003. NIPSCO, a NiSource subsidiary, is a regulated utility that 
provides natural gas 
o nearly 700,000 customers and electricity to 416,000 customers across the 
northern third of Indiana. 

""Virtually all of our operationally available capacity is sold out now until 
the fourth quarter of this 
year,"" said NGPL President Deborah Mcdonald in an interview. 

""Basically about a third of the transportation contracts and a third of the 
storage contracts are 
up for renewal every year. We've been very successful in our efforts 
resigning our three major 
customers [NiGas, NIPSCO and Peoples]."" Despite increasing competitive 
pressure from 
Northern Border and Alliance Pipeline, the pipeline also has had surprising 
luck signing 
agreements with marketers and power generators. 

""In contrast to the traditional market of long-haul transportation from the 
Midcontinent and 
Louisiana to Chicago, we have been extending our horizons trying to find a 
new market in 
the marketers rather than the core LDCs. Obviously the contract that we 
signed earlier this
year with Aquila Energy for 500,000 MMBtu of transportation capacity has also 
really helped 
us be successful in our recontracting efforts,"" Mcdonald said. 

""We also have developed a number of new rate services for gas-fired power 
generators. 
Growth in NGPL will come from natural gas-fired generation. You probably saw 
our press 
release about the Ameren contracts for [construction of 1,700 MW of 
generation along the
NGPL system]. In the aggregate we think we are on target to connect over 
3,000 MW of 
gas-fired generation this year and over 3,000 MW next year as well [which 
would represent 
up to 900 MMcf/d in gas transportation capacity]. 

""Obviously another challenge is going to be [the 1.325 Bcf/d] Alliance 
Pipeline coming into 
the market this fall. It's anyone's guess whether that will really fill up in 
a short period of time. 
I think a lot of that will be coming into Chicago and moving back out on 
Vector. But we're 
ready at Hub America to kind of serve as a giant header system [with Texas 
Eastern as 
an eastbound partner]."" 

Mcdonald was not prepared, however, to announce the results of a recent open 
season 
for about 100 MMcf/d of capacity that will be available through a new 
interconnection between 
NGPL and Tetco for eastbound transportation."

EBS/Blockbuster movies on-demand announcement this week, as Merrill Lynch put 
it, &confirms the tremendous inroads Enron has made in the telecommunications 
business.8  We expect this deal to be a springboard for enabling EBS to 
accomplish even greater things.

Because we believe that EBS is integral to Enron,s success, it is becoming 
increasingly important for greater interaction among EBS senior management, 
corporate leadership and our Houston-based business units.   In short, we 
determined that it is necessary for the CEO to be based in Houston, although 
the Portland office will remain an integral part of EBS. 

Joe Hirko as CEO and Ken Rice as Chief Commercial Officer have accomplished 
great things, and we believe that both are completely qualified to fill the 
CEO role moving forward.  However, Joe has decided to stay in Portland for 
family reasons, and as a result, Ken will assume the role of CEO for EBS, 
effective immediately.  

Joe, unfortunately, has decided to leave Enron.  We want to recognize Joe for 
his role in making EBS a success.  He started the business, demonstrated its 
value to Enron management, and brought the team together to create the EBS 
vision.

We do believe that EBS will continue to grow and succeed under Ken,s 
leadership.  Throughout his 19-year career with Enron, he has consistently 
been a driving force in building businesses.

Reliant Energy Plans to Form Two Public Companies

Reliant Energy said it plans to file with the Texas Public Utility
Commission a business separation plan under which it would divide into two
publicly traded companies to separate its unregulated businesses from its
regulated businesses.

The company plans an initial public offering of approximately 20% of the
common stock of its unregulated operations late this year or early in 2001,
assuming market conditions remain favorable. The company expects the IPO to
be followed by a distribution to shareholders of the remaining stock of the
unregulated company within 12 months. The remaining businesses, which are
predominately regulated, will be structured as a holding company.

The unregulated company will own Reliant Energy's unregulated power
generation and related energy trading and marketing operations, its
unregulated retail businesses, which currently include energy,
telecommunications and internet services, and the company's European
electric generating and trading/marketing operations. The plan also
contemplates that in 2004 the unregulated company will receive from the
regulated company cash equal to the market value of the regulated company's
interest in its Texas regulated generation operations. In addition, the
unregulated company will have an option to purchase the regulated company's
interest in these operations at a price equal to the market value.

The regulated company will include Reliant Energy's electricity and natural
gas companies, which serve about four million customers in the U.S. and
include Reliant Energy HL&P/Entex, Reliant Energy Arkla, Reliant Energy
Entex and Reliant Energy Minnegasco. Other operations in the entity will
include its U.S. interstate pipelines, its interests in Latin America and,
initially, its Texas regulated generation."

     The FERC has given final approval for a Questar $155 million
pipeline project to transport natural gas to southern California from
the Four Corners area at the borders of New Mexico, Arizona, Utah and
Colorado. The ruling came after the commission was satisfied the
Questar Southern Trails Pipeline project would not harm the
environment. The project will consist of 693 miles of crude oil
pipeline that was bought by Questar in 1998 from Arco. The pipeline
will be converted for natural gas and several new compressors will be
built. The pipeline would be divided into a East Zone and a West
Zone. The East Zone will begin in the San Juan Basin in New Mexico
and end at the California border and carry up to 88 MMcf per day. The
West Zone is within California and has a capacity of 120 MMcf per

,07/27/2000,,kevin.hyatt@enron.com,bullets@enron.com,"linda.wehring@enron.com, sharris1@enron.com",Bullets 7/28,"Caithness - Confidentiality agreements were sent this week to the project 
developers of the 550Mw Big Sandy project in northwest Arizona.  Work 
continues on developing pipe lateral costs and environmental impact 
statements.

KN Energy - Their current transport contract to the West has a ROFR that 
expires 7/31.  The 20,000 MMBtu/d capacity is split evenly between Topock and 
Needles (KN is not currently flowing anything to Topock) at a rate of 
$.13/MMBtu.  Even with the Topock space, the total capacity could be worth 
something in the low to mid $.20's.  KN would also like to keep the ROFR 
language but this could only occur with a max rate deal for a term of one 
year or longer.  We should have any offer from KN by Monday 7/31.

Operations - we temporarily lost a compressor for approximately 1 hour at 
Station 2 on Thursday.  There was minimal throughput impacted.  An unusual 
""knock"" sound has also been coming from one of the units at Station 4.  High 
western flow is taking its toll on equipment.

August Capacity - West demand is expected to be robust for August (higher 
than June) with high temperatures combined with lower hydro-generation 
capacity available from the Northwest (per CERA).

El Paso / Blanco Mis-Measurement - A letter was drafted this week for Stan's 
signature for delivery to El Paso's management.  The letter outlines the 
circumstances and chronology of events leading up to our meeting with El Paso 
in June.  The letter requests a payback of all the gas volume.  Stan has 
opted not attach a copy of the lawsuit filing to the letter. 

Reliant - Extended their Flex Firm (Primary Receipt and Primary Delivery at 
the West Texas Pool) from July to August 2000 for $.03, but increased volumes 
from 10,000 MMBtu/day to 20,000 MMBtu/day. 

ENA / Citizens Utilities - The new Citizens interconnect for the Griffith 
power plant was scheduled to be purged and filled with gas this week.  As 
manager of Citizen's transport agreement, ENA has notified us verbally they 
will request some or all of the 25,000 MMBtu/d of primary delivery capacity 
for that point.  As soon as we receive their request in writing, we will 
discuss strategy with legal and regulatory to evaluate all TW's options.

Duke Atoka-Crawford Proposal - For a $750,000 construction contribution from 
TW, Duke is willing to build out part of their gathering system to unload 
20,000 MMBtu/d off the Atoka lateral and re-deliver gas to TW's Crawford 
lateral.  TW would receive a 5 year FT at a rate of $.05 plus actual fuel.  
Oasis would be the primary delivery point.  This project has the added 
benefit of allowing TW to sell incremental space on the Atoka lateral.  

In addition, Duke is proposing to install additional compression to deliver 
up to 40,000 MMBtu/d of incremental volume to TW off the Zia plant.  In 
exchange, TW would provide a discounted $.035 IT transport rate for a two 
year term.  The Zia gas would flow through a new tap into TW's high pressure 
30"" line.   This project has a fuel saving benefit to TW by eliminating one 
stage of compression from the low pressure system."

,07/31/2000,,office.chairman@enron.com,all.worldwide@enron.com,,Organisational Announcement - Introducing Enron Global Markets,"As evidenced by an exceptionally strong performance in the second quarter, 
Enron,s wholesale energy businesses in North America and Europe continue to 
experience tremendous growth.  The opportunities to continue to grow our 
natural gas and power businesses have never been better and it is critical to 
Enron,s future success that we remain focused on expanding these businesses 
and maintaining the strong momentum we have in these markets.

It is equally important that we continue to develop new businesses outside of 
gas and electricity, which can make significant contributions to our earnings 
growth.  We have made significant progress in developing these businesses in 
North America, Europe, and most recently in our new Net Works business unit.  
Included in these global businesses are our efforts in crude and products, 
coal, emissions, insurance, currency, equity trading, interest rates, credit 
trading, paper and pulp, and metals.

While significant progress has been made in these efforts we need to 
accelerate the growth of these new businesses while continuing to 
aggressively expand our core gas and electricity businesses in North America 
and Europe.  In order to accomplish these two objectives and to capitalize on 
the increasingly global opportunities in these new businesses we are today 
announcing the formation of a new business unit ) Enron Global Markets.  This 
new business unit will focus on markets and commodities which are global in 
scope, but outside our traditional gas and power markets.  This new core 
business unit will operate in parallel with and in close coordination with 
the North American and European businesses.

Enron Global Markets will be headed by Mike McConnell, President and Chief 
Executive Officer, and Jeff Shankman, Chief Operating Officer.  They will 
report to Mark Frevert who will be Chairman of Enron Global Markets.  Mark, 
Mike and Jeff will comprise the Office of the Chairman for Enron Global 
Markets.

Included in this new business unit and reporting to the Office of the 
Chairman will be the following businesses and their leaders:
- Global Crude and Products:     John Nowlan
- Coal:         George McClellan
- Currency, equities, interest rate and agricultural trading:  Gary Hickerson
- Insurance and weather:      Jere Overdyke

Enron,s metals business and Enron Credit.com will remain the responsibility 
of Enron Europe. The Paper and Pulp business will continue to reside in North 
America. 

With the departure of Mike McConnell from Enron Net Works, we are pleased to 
announce the following appointments in that business unit:
- Jeff McMahon: President and Chief Operating Officer
- Louise Kitchen: Chief Commercial Officer
- Philippe Bibi:  Chief Technology Officer

Jeff, Louise and Philippe, along with Greg Whalley,  will comprise the Office 
of the Chairman for Enron Net Works.

With Jeff Shankman,s departure from Enron North America,s natural gas 
operation, all of Jeff,s direct reports will report to John Lavorato.

We are also pleased to announce the following changes to the Enron North 
America Office of the Chairman.  John Lavorato will join the ENA Office of 
the Chairman as Chief Operating Officer.  Dave Delainey will assume the role 
of President and Chief Executive Officer.  Mark Frevert will retain his role 
as Chairman of Enron North America in addition to his role as Chairman of 
both Enron Global Markets and Enron Europe.

Please join us in congratulating everyone in their new assignments and in 
supporting the new Enron Global Markets organisation."

    FPL Group will acquire Entergy for about $6.4 billion in stock in
a deal that will create the largest US power company. The news sent
FPLs shares lower because of disappointment that FPL was not the
takeover target. The combined company will have 6.3 million customers
and 48,000 MW of power generating capacity. FPL supplies electric
service to about 3.8 million customers throughout Florida. Entergy
delivers electricity to about 2.5 million customers in parts of
Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi. The deal, a $27 billion
merger, which included their combined market value of $16.4 billion,
$6.9 billion of Entergy debt and $3.8 billion of FPL debt. FPL
shareholders will own 57% of the new company and Entergys 43%. The
board of directors will be made up of 8 FPL members and 7 Entergy
members. To support the deal, FPL and Entergy plan to buy back a
total of $1 billion in stock, $570 million in FPL stock and $430
million in Entergy stock. FPL shareholders will receive one share in
the new company for each of FPLs 170.5 million diluted shares
outstanding. Entergy shareholders would receive 0.585 share in the
new company for each of their 228.1 million diluted shares
outstanding. Shares of FPL fell more than 8%, to 48-1/4 and Entergy
shares fell more than 10% to 27-1/4 yesterday afternoon. Based on
FPLs price on Monday morning, the deal values Entergy at about $28.33
per share. Many had speculated FPL was to be bought rather than be
involved in a merger. The merger agreement includes a $200 million
break-up fee in case either side terminates the deal. The merger of
FPL and Entergy must be cleared by shareholders as well as federal
regulators and was expected to close next year. The combined company
expects to pay a dividend that is consistent with FPLs current
dividend policy. Based on its current annual dividend of $2.16 per
share, Entergys shareholders would receive $1.26 per share compared
with its current dividend of $1.20 per share. FPLs Broadhead will
become the chairman and Entergy Chief Executive Leonard will become
chief executive of the new company. The expected annual cost savings
and increased revenues for both competitive and regulated businesses
may range from $150 million to $275 million, with about half the cost
savings to come from work force reductions, mainly through attrition,
growth and voluntary retirement."

Kern River is holding an open season through Aug. 18 to determine interest in 
year-round FT to Nevada 
and California and interest in capacity relinquishment by existing firm 
shippers. The pipeline said it can 
offer significantly reduced FT rates based on recent FERC approval of Kern 
River's Extended Term 
Rate Program (ET Program). Under ET Program, customers could receive a rate 
reduction from $0.64/Dth 
to approximately $0.42 under a 15-year contract. Because system expansion can 
be accomplished by the 
addition of compression facilities, it could result in an overall lowering of 
rolled-in rates for all shippers, Kern 
River said. Depending on open season results, the pipeline is proposing a 
mainline expansion of up to 500 
MMcf/d with an in-service target date of May 1, 2002. If goals can be met 
using relinquished capacity and no 
new facilities are required, new service could begin as early as Oct. 1, 
2001. Call Laurie Brown at 
(801) 584-6410 or Greg Snow at -7270 for more information.

      The northern Illinois and southeastern Wisconsin gas transportation 
markets, which long have been dominated by
      ANR Pipeline, moved one step closer to obtaining pipeline-on-pipeline 
competition yesterday when FERC awarded
      the proposed Guardian Pipeline LLC a favorable preliminary 
determination on non-environmental issues. 

      The decision was a major win for the proposed greenfield pipeline 
because not only did it shoot down most of the
      arguments presented by ANR to thwart the project, but it found that 
even though the project would ""adversely
      affect"" landowner interests, Guardian was making ""reasonable efforts"" 
to mitigate the impact on landowners. 

      Moreover, FERC ruled that while the $224 million pipeline would compete 
head-to-head with ANR, it would not
      have a negative affect on the Coastal pipeline and its customers. ""On 
balance, the Commission finds that the
      proposed Guardian pipeline will provide substantial public benefits 
with minimal adverse impacts,"" the order said
      [CP00-36]. 

      The Commission also found that sufficient need was established for the 
36-inch, 140-mile pipeline that would
      transport 750,000 Dth/d of gas from the Chicago Hub to markets in 
northern Illinois and southern Wisconsin,
      providing customers there with an alternative to ANR and access to 
competitive Canadian gas supplies. It would
      terminate near Ixonia, WI, where it would interconnect with Wisconsin 
Gas Co.'s distribution system. At the
      Chicago Hub, the pipeline proposes to interconnect to Alliance 
Pipeline, Northern Border Pipeline, Midwestern Gas
      Pipeline and Natural Gas Pipeline Co. of America. 

      Guardian has executed 10-year precedent agreements with four shippers 
for 702,500 Dth/d, which equals about
      94% of the project's design capacity. The largest shipper by far will 
be Wisconsin Gas, which has committed itself
      to 650,000 Dth/d of the capacity on the proposed line. In fact, the 
Guardian project is an outgrowth of Wisconsin
      Gas's request for proposals (RFP) process in June 1998, which the LDC 
initiated in anticipation of the expiration of
      its firm transportation contract with ANR in October 2003. The other 
shippers on Guardian include Alliant Energy
      (10,000 Dth/d), WPS Energy Services Inc. (2,500 Dth/d) and an unnamed 
shipper (40,000 Dth/d). The project has a
      targeted in-service date of Nov. 1, 2002. 

      In multiple protests filed at the Commission, ANR argued that 
Guardian's application was ""patently deficient""
      because it didn't include the proposed lateral that Wisconsin Gas plans 
to build to interconnect with Guardian.
      Wisconsin Gas currently is seeking the approval of state regulators to 
build the lateral. Furthermore, ANR claimed
      Wisconsin Gas was using its monopoly power as a franchised LDC serving 
southern Wisconsin to subsidize the
      Guardian project. Wisconsin Gas's parent, WICOR Inc., is one of the 
sponsors of Guardian. The other backers are
      CMS Gas Transmission and Storage and Viking Gas Transmission. 

      But FERC rejected both arguments. ""While previous attempts to inject 
competition into ANR's market in this area
      have failed, we believe that this area is ripe for competition, and 
that it is only a matter of time before other
      pipelines submit similar proposals to the Commission. We find that the 
proposed project will provide southeastern
      Wisconsin with access to another source of supply, which will allow 
this market to enjoy the benefits of
      pipeline-to-pipeline competition for the first time,"" the order noted."

With plans to grow its power generation portfolio in the United States, 
InterGen, the power generation 
joint venture of Royal Dutch/Shell Group and Bechtel Enterprise Holdings 
Inc., closed a deal yesterday 
giving the international developer a 30% equity interest in Houston-based 
Coral Energy, one of the 
largest natural gas and power marketers in the country. 

Coral Energy officials had predicted in July that Shell and construction 
giant Bechtel would fold InterGen, 
InterGen North America and certain assets of Coral Energy into one business 
(see Daily GPI, July 10). 
Under the agreement announced yesterday, InterGen will receive the majority 
of the natural gas pipeline, 
storage and power generation assets of Shell's Coral Energy affiliate in the 
United States. It remains a 
joint venture of Shell and Bechtel. 

The move gives Shell a 68% ownership in InterGen, with Bechtel owning the 
remaining 32%. InterGen 
had been formed as a 50/50 joint venture, and Bechtel made an undisclosed 
payment to Shell in the 
deal. About 230 Coral employees, mostly related to the Texas-based assets in 
Houston, will become 
InterGen employees under the agreement. 

InterGen is considered a world leader in power generation development, with 
projects around the world. 
Carlos Riva, InterGen's CEO, said that the transaction ""represents a 
significant boost to our plans in the 
United States. These assets and strengthened alignment with a premier U.S. 
gas and electricity trading 
enterprise will provide InterGen a strong platform for growth in the U.S. 
market."" 

Globally, the alignment is expected to help leverage Shell's strengths in 
both fuel supply and power 
marketing and trading. Bechtel will continue to be InterGen's preferred 
provider for worldwide power 
generation engineering, procurement and construction services. Coral is the 
region's third largest natural 
gas marketer and the twentieth largest power marketer in the country. 

Linda Cook, Shell Gas and Power's CEO, said the ""whole idea"" was to help 
InterGen grow in the United 
States, and that the best way was to add Shell assets to it. ""Success in 
tomorrow's energy markets will 
be earned through globally aligned marketing, trading and asset companies,"" 
said Cook. ""That's 
critically true in the U.S. and will be the case as competitive energy 
markets open worldwide. InterGen 
plans to build a sizable power generation portfolio in the U.S., working 
closely with Coral to pursue 
investment decisions that make the most commercial sense. We expect this 
relationship to make a 
significant contribution to both InterGen's and Coral's long-term success."" 

Shell and Bechtel formed InterGen in March 1999 (see Daily GPI, March 18, 
1999) specifically to pursue 
power generation opportunities in North America. The Boston-based company was 
set up to develop, 

""Shell, Bechtel and InterGen have among them the complete skill set for 
success in the new global energy 
market,"" said Paul Unruh, COO of Bechtel. ""InterGen is a world-class 
developer with a proven track record 
of successfully developing, financing and operating projects around the 
world. Shell is one of the most 
successful marketers and traders of energy in the U.S. and is expanding into 
deregulating natural gas 
and power markets globally; Bechtel is a global leader in the development, 
engineering and construction 
of power facilities. These strengths together create a large power generation 
platform now directly linked 
with global energy marketing and trading."" 

InterGen's portfolio will give Coral Energy access for its trading business, 
and Coral will participate as part 
of Shell's global trading network, with InterGen a business partner in its 
expanding North American asset 
platform. As the exclusive marketer of Shell's gas production, Coral has a 
gas supply of 2.5 Bcf/d, and a 
trading platform dealing in extensive volumes of energy in all key supply 
basins. For Bechtel, the agreement 
will help it lock in construction contracts for its combined cycle gas 
turbine power stations. 

Specifically, the assets to be transferred to InterGen from Coral include the 
following: 

4,000 miles of major intrastate gas pipelines in Texas. The pipeline 
facilities extend from South Texas near the 
Mexican border along the Texas Gulf Coast to the Louisiana boarder, and north 
from near Houston to the East 
Texas producing areas. 
The West Clear Lake Storage facility, one of the largest natural gas storage 
reservoirs in Texas. Located near 
the Houston Ship Channel, it has a leasehold interest in the Stratton Ridge 
storage facility. 
Coral's interest of more than 500 MW in four power plants --- one in 
operation and three under construction. The 
transfer would follow equity and regulatory approvals. 
In total, Coral had 6,100 miles of gas pipeline that ran along the Gulf Coast 
in Texas and Louisiana. It also is 
building a 100-mile long pipeline in northern Mexico with that country's 
national oil company, PEMEX. 

Currently, InterGen is either operating or building 11 power stations with a 
total of 7,985 MW. It also has
7,040 MW in advanced development. Projects are being operated, under 
construction or are in advanced 
development in the United Kingdom, the Philippines, Colombia, Mexico, China, 
Egypt, Brazil, Australia, Turkey 
and the United States."

The board of directors of the New York Mercantile Exchange has amended plans 
to move 
up the start-up time for natural gas futures trading because of the overlap 
with crude oil markets, 
which share an options ring with natural gas. Daily gas futures trading now 
will commence at 
9:30 a.m. rather than 9:45. The board has scheduled expanded energy trading 
hours to begin 
with the Sept. 8 trading session. 

On July 13, the board voted to expand futures trading hours electronically 
for its light sweet crude 
oil, heating oil, gasoline, and natural gas futures and options markets. It 
also voted to have an 
earlier opening for the open outcry session for natural gas futures and 
options.

Beginning at 4 p.m. on Sept. 7 the Nymex Access electronic trading sessions 
for those commodities 
will be extended to run from 4 p.m., Mondays through Thursdays, to 9 a.m. the 
following day. On 
Sundays, the session will begin at 7 p.m. and will run until 9 a.m. on 
Monday. Currently, the sessions 
for light sweet crude oil, heating oil and gasoline begin at the same times 
but close at 8 a.m. Natural 
gas futures and options currently are traded from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. Mondays 
through Thursdays with

El Paso said Thursday, 
and once that is done the test must be performed again. It estimated the 
project will extend through 
Sunday, reducing Bondad Mainline capacity by 180 MMcf/d (normal capacity is 
675 MMcf/d) and 
affecting seven receipt points. With Line 3201 out of service, the 180 MMcf/d 
loss can not be made
 up at points downstream of Bondad Mainline, El Paso said. Thus the same (not 
additional) 
180 MMcf/d reduction must be applied at Gallup (NM) Station. 

PG&E Gas Transmission-Northwest said its Internet-based nomination system 
became operational 
again Thursday morning after a Wednesday evening power failure caused the 
server to crash. 

El Paso will hold meetings Aug. 9 in Houston, Aug. 10 in Los Angeles and Aug. 
11 in Phoenix to present 
details of its Line No. 2000 Project. The project requires FERC approval to 
abandon certain mainline 
compressor facilities and replace them with a 30-inch crude oil pipeline upon 
its conversion to natural 
gas service. El Paso announced early this year (see Daily GPI, Feb. 4) it was 
buying part of the 
All American Pipeline from Plains All American Pipeline L.P. and would invest 
$75 million to convert 
the segment to a natural gas pipeline. The segment being converted extends 
1,088 miles from Emidio, 
CA, to McCamey, TX. Those planning to attend one of next week's meetings 
should call Lisa Holmes at 
(915) 496-2568 or send e-mail to holmesl@epenergy.com."

This brings our fuel hedge thus far to 15,000 MMBtu/d at an average price of 
$3.53 (basis adjusted).  We are evaluating doing another 5000/d and/or 
selling out-of the-money calls and collecting the premiums.

Interactive Open Season - TW has posted an announcement for an Interactive 
Open Season to be held August 10, 2000 for 14,000 MMBtu/d of East of Thoreau 
to PG&E/Topock capacity for the term of April 1, 2001 - October 31, 2001.  
With Topock values currently depressed relative to Needles, we'll attempt to 
add some value to the IOS by giving shippers alternative delivery capability 
at Needles and the new power plant at Citizens/Griffith.

Southwest Gas - has finally begun construction on the new interconnect 
between SWG and TW!!!  Per our Interconnect & Operating Agreement we must pay 
the remaining half of the CIAC, which is estimated to be $442,500, ""...no 
later than 10 days following the date on which SWG notifies TW that the new 
interconnect will be in-service within 3 months.""  SWG has not met this 
criteria yet.

Burlington - Burlington has requested TW respond to an apparent discrepancy 
in the physical volumes we can (or cannot) take from them at the Val Verde 
Plant versus the currently effective operating agreement.  The problem is 
current high temperatures in the San Juan region have limited our take-away 
capabilities and the summer / winter seasonality was not taken into account 
when we drafted the last amendment in January of this year.  We will meet 
with Legal, Facility Planning and Gas Control to craft a response for Richard 
Riehm.

Amoco - We have scheduled a conference call with Legal and Commercial Reps 
from Amoco for next Tuesday afternoon to discuss the Transport Options 
Program.

Red Cedar - Negotiations continue on the FT deal.  Red Cedar has requested an 
option to call on 35,000 MMBtu of capacity in year 2 of the 5 year 
agreement.   Working with Enron Risk Management, we determined the value of 
this option to be approximately $200,000 which may be rolled into the 
contract.

El Paso Field Services - In our efforts to move ahead on the new 
interconnect, we have responded to EPFS that TW would commit $100,000 towards 
the new interconnect as well as require a volume commitment from EPFS of 
20,000 MMBtu/d for up to 2 years.  EPFS is taking TW's offer to management 
for review.

El Paso Natural Gas - The letter to EP for Stan Horton's signature relative 
to our Blanco measurement dispute is going through its final iterations and

,06/15/2000,,enron.announcements@enron.com,enron.mail@enron.com,,PAC ENROLLMENT,"Last year the Enron Political Action Committee (PAC) launched a campaign to 
become a ""million dollar PAC"".  Enron employees, who provide all of the 
funding for the PAC, responded and the Enron PAC reached its objective, 
becoming one of the largest corporate PACs.  This year we face a new 
challenge.  With the sale of EOG, the announced sale of PGE and normal 
employee turnover, we have lost a significant number of consistent 
contributors.  We are seeking your support.  If you are not a member, please 
join.  If you are a member, we hope you will consider increasing your 
contribution.

The Enron PAC is an essential tool in our effort to promote sound public 
policy.  Our PAC funds support local, state and federal candidates, of both 
parties, who support open markets, deregulation and customer choice.  Amounts 
contributed may be used to make political contributions in connection with 
federal and state elections and are subject to the limits of the Federal 
Election Campaign Act.  While our PAC has grown thanks to our employee 
contributions, it still generates just a fraction of the expenditures of 
those who oppose these ideals.

This year, as always, we face challenges and opportunities for every one of 
our businesses, including such issues as taxation and regulation of 
e-commerce, electric industry restructuring, regulation of derivatives, 
international trade and investment legislation, pipeline safety, local and 
state decisions affecting the siting and interconnection of power plants and 
a variety of environmental and tax issues.  Enron has a long and successful 
track record of supporting and advancing good public policy.  That track 
record depends on access to and regular communication with, decision makers.  
The PAC provides that access - - it shows policy makers that real voters care 
about what they are doing.

One of the best things about Enron is that we don,t just take things as they 
are.  We challenge the status quo.  We ask why.  We change things.  The PAC 
helps us do that.  We need you to help the PAC.  Sign up today - and please 
consider the following contribution guidelines:

Manager    $500/year
Director     $750/year
Sr. Director/General Manager  $1,000/year
Vice President    $2,500/year
Sr. VP/Managing Director  $3,500/year
Executive Committee   $5,000/year

All contributions are voluntary and these guidelines are merely suggestions.  
You are free to contribute more or less than the guidelines suggested and 
Enron will not favor or disadvantage anyone by reason of the amount of their 
contribution or their decision not to contribute.  You may refuse to 
contribute without fear of reprisal.

Only U.S. citizens and resident-aliens living in the U.S. can contribute to 
the Enron PAC.  The maximum contribution is $5,000 per year per individual.  
An individual may not contribute more than $25,000 to all federal candidates 
and committees within a calendar year.  The law requires that Enron report 
name, address, employer and occupation for every person who contributes over 
$200/year.

No portion of any contribution is deductible as a charitable contribution for 
federal income tax purposes.

United Way campaign, &Who Wants to Help Millions?8   While we,ve tested your 
physical stamina the last couple of years with our basketball themed 
kick-offs, this year we thought we,d test your intellectual curiosity with 
our own version of ABC,s &Who Wants to be a Millionaire?8
 
We strongly encourage all of you to attend today,s campaign kick-off at the 
Hyatt Regency,s Imperial Ballroom followed by a free Chick Fil A lunch in 
Antioch Park. The kick-off begins promptly at 11:15 a.m. and seating will be 
on a first-come first-serve basis, so be sure to arrive early for a seat in 
your reserved business unit section.  In case of rain, please see rain plan 
below.

You will have a chance to see many of your co-workers take a chance in the 
&hot seat,8 all while raising funds for the United Way of the Texas Gulf 
Coast. Jeff Skilling, Joe Sutton and I, along with United Way,s Jackie 
Martin, and Curt Mooney from DePelchin Children,s Center will even serve as 
lifelines, and Houston,s own Regis ) ABC Channel 13,s Don Nelson, will host 
the event. 

If you are unable to get a seat in the Hyatt studio audiences, we have 
arranged for alternate viewing options:

? Enron Lobby TV
? IP-TV on your desktop, in the Start Menu under Programs

We have added an exciting element to pledging this year, an electronic 
pledging system. Please click on the United Way link 
http://unitedway.enron.com or go directly to Internet Explorer or Netscape 
and type in unitedway.enron.com in the address field.  Either option should 
take you to Enron,s United Way 2000 Campaign site where you should be able to 
make your pledge within minutes.   

We are happy to report that last year, employees generously donated $2.2 
million to the campaign. This year, we hope to reach our employee goal of 
$2.3 million.   

Thank you in advance for your generosity, and we look forward to seeing you 
at 11:15 a.m.

,08/10/2000,,kevin.hyatt@enron.com,market.team@enron.com,,TW Bullets 8/11,"Interactive Open Season - TW held its third IOS of the year this week for 
14,000 MMBtu/d of space from East of Thoreau to PG&E Topock.  Ten parties 
originally registered to bid of which 7 actually participated.  The high bid 
was Reliant at $.138.

Gallup Compressor - A meeting was held with Operations, Regulatory, and 
Facility Planning personnel to review the performance of the new compressor 
station.  Currently, the vibration level has increased.  The unit and lateral 
efficiency are a continuing concern.  Operations plans to pull the unit apart 
in early September for an evaluation.  At this time, the anticipated 30,000 
MMBtu/d of ""additional"" capacity we hoped to have is now not available.  
There is also concern that we may be unable to meet our currently subscribed 
FT obligation.

El Paso All American - We attended the El Paso Pipeline meeting this week as 
they described their FERC filing to begin the conversion of the All American 
Pipeline from oil to gas.  They reiterated several times to attending 
shippers that the project would not offer any incremental space to the main 
line.  El Paso's filing centers around the cost and fuel savings from 
decommissioning very old compressor equipment on their south system and 
replacing the capacity with the All American line.  The cost figures 
(conversion and acquisition) that El Paso filed tracked very closely with 
what Transwestern estimated in its evaluation of the pipe.  The in-service 
date is expected to be July 1, 2001.

Transport Options - TW Commercial reps met with marketing and regulatory 
personnel from Burlington Resources, Conoco, and Texaco this week to review 
the proposed Transport Options Tariff filing.  The meeting was very positive 
and constructive.  Several suggestions were made that led to the realization 
that the best course of action would be to delay the actual tariff filing and 
have a working group meeting in the Houston office.  Everyone agreed that as 
much preliminary work as possible should be done before the filing to make 
the whole process less contentious and to garner more customer support for 
the tariff.  We are trying to schedule the working group session for the 
third week of August.

Crawford Lateral - A line leak on the lateral this week reduced flow from 
50,000 MMBtu/d to zero.  Operations initially estimated 2-3 days of down time 
but actually only required 12 hours.  Approximately 55 feet of line was 
replaced.

El Paso Measurement Letter - Stan Horton forwarded the ""mis-measurement"" 
letter to El Paso management this week.  We will follow up in approximately 
two weeks if they don't respond sooner.

Operator Imbalances - Met with Market Services personnel to review operator 
imbalances across TW's system.  Marketing is supportive of Gas Control's 
efforts to limit the imbalances and begin allocations if operators schedule 
gas and then can't deliver.  With proactive balance management, there is 
opportunity to realize greater Park 'N Ride revenue.

TransColorado Shipper Meeting - Kevin Hyatt will be attending the 
TransColorado shipper meeting this week in Boulder.  Christine Stokes 
attended the Colorado Oil & Gas Association meeting."

There are a couple of important changes from the last draft.

One is that we're no longer stating that the option fee is going to be 
""market-based.""  At FERC, the term ""market-based"" has connotations of having 
to prove to FERC that a non-cost-based rate is appropriate because we lack 
market power.  While we probably do lack market power, the consensus of the 
legal/regulatory team was to try to portray the option fee as a built-in 
feature of the transport rate, which is simply being disaggregated into a 
separate option fee.  If this theory is not clear to you after you read the 
filing letter, let's discuss how it should be improved.

The other significant change (also based on my meeting with legal/regulatory) 
is that I've structured the tariff language and the agreement so that every 
shipper, regardless of whether they currently use transport on TW, will have 
to have a firm transportation agreement when they buy an option.  In other 
words, a shipper that does not currently have a service agreement will simply 
execute an agreement with a MAXDTQ of zero.  This structure has two 
advantages:  1) it's consistent with our option-fee-as-part-of-transport-rate 
theory, and 2) it will help support that theory in our next rate case.

I'd like to meet next week, either Wednesday afternoon or Thursday, to 
discuss the following topics:

1)  Your comments and questions on this draft,
2)  Some examples of options, to make sure the tariff provisions and contract 
work from a logistical standpoint,
3)  The bidding process, and how bids for options will be evaluated, and
4)  Comments received from shippers thus far.

I'll be working on 41 tomorrow; let's talk about what would be a good meeting 
time.
I will be out Mon. and Tues."

Respect, Integrity, Communication and Excellence in everything they do.  Some 
of these heroes make a big splash while others just quietly make a difference 
in the workplace around them.  Either way, these special individuals deserve 
to be recognized with a nomination for the 2000 Chairman's Award.

As there is more than just one employee living the values at Enron, this 
award program will honor 10 employees as members of the Chairman's 
Roundtable.  From that group, the one individual most embodying our values 
will be presented with the Chairman's Award at the Management Conference in 
San Antonio in November.

The beauty of this award program is that it is completely employee-driven 
from beginning to end.  From your nominations, an international employee 
committee will select the Chairman's Roundtable and eventually, the 
Chairman's Award winner.  Your role of nominating our everyday heroes is 
extremely vital to the program's success.  If someone has made a positive 
impression on you, please take the time to complete a nomination form and 
send it to Charla Reese by October 1, 2000.  You may click here for a 
printable form:  http://home.enron.com/announce/chairman_nom/form3.doc

Renowned hurricane soothsayer Dr. William Gray and his team at Colorado State 
University have 
scaled back their forecast for the hurricane season but still expect the 
season to be more active than 
average. Seven rather than eight hurricanes are expected now and only three 
of them are expected 
to be intense rather than the four expected in the group's prior forecast on 
June 7. In round numbers, 
the August forecast is for three named storms, two hurricanes, and one 
intense or major hurricane. 

""Information obtained through July 2000 indicates that the Atlantic hurricane 
season in 2000 is likely 
to be less active than the four recent very busy years of 1995, 1996, 1998 
and 1999. However, total 
activity is expected to exceed the long term average and is anticipated to be 
considerably more 
active than the mean for the recent period of 1970 through 1994. 

""We estimate that the 2000 season will have seven hurricanes (average is 
5.7), 11 named storms 
(average is 9.3), 55 named storm days (average is 47), 30 hurricane days 
(average is 24), three 
intense (category 3-4-5) hurricanes (average is 2.2), six intense hurricane 
days (average is 4.7) and 
a Hurricane Destruction Potential (HDP) of 90 (average is 71). Collectively, 
net tropical cyclone 
activity in year 2000 is expected to be about 130% of the long term average. 

The early August forecast update is in close to Gray's Dec. 8, 1999) and 
April 7 forecasts, but 
somewhat lower than his recent June 7 update. ""The forecast has been lowered 
slightly [because] 
June-July global circulation conditions have not progressed quite as 
favorably for hurricane 
enhancement than as we anticipated in our early June forecast,"" Gray said."

To make certain that we understand what is expected of us, Enron has adopted 
certain policies, approved by the Board of Directors, which are in the Code 
of Ethics July 2000, formerly known as the Enron Conduct of Business 
Affairs.  This year, we,ve made some revisions to our Code of Ethics to 
address recent policies approved by the Board of Directors and adopted by 
Enron.  These changes include:  

  Principles of Human Rights have been added, which describe Enron,s 
responsibility to conduct itself according to basic tenets of human behavior 
that transcend industries, cultures, economics, and local, regional and 
national boundaries (see pg. 4);

the US government under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (see pg. 50); and
  Additional language regarding Enron,s policy on conflicts of interests, 
investments, and outside business interests of employees (see pg. 57).   

The Code of Ethics contains commonsense rules of conduct that most employees 
practice on a day-to-day basis.  However, I ask that you read them carefully 
and completely to make certain that you are complying with these policies.  
It is absolutely essential that you fully comply with these policies in the 
future.  If you have any questions, I encourage you to discuss them with your 
supervisor or Enron legal counsel.

users plus all existing system users.  SAP brings a new dynamic to Enron, 
enhancing the timely flow and sharing of specific project, human resources, 
procurement, and financial information across Business Units and across 
continents.


This final implementation will retire multiple, disparate systems and replace 
them with a common, integrated system encompassing many processes including 
payroll, timekeeping, benefits, project management, and numerous financial 
processes.  

Employees will be empowered to update and/or view their personal information 
via the intranet-based eHRonline -- a single front-end to SAP's Self Service 
functionality and Enron's Global Information System (GIS).  Among other 
things, individuals will be able to update personal information (including 
W-4, addresses and personal banking information), manage their individual 
time using a new time entry tool, view their benefit elections, and view 
their personal payroll information on-line.

Existing SAP users currently supported by the Center of Expertise (COE) ) 
including the London COE.

People will be impacted gradually over the next few weeks:

June 12 - Current SAP users may notice (and may use) new features in some of 
the SAP modules -- this new functionality was developed to meet requirements 
of Business Units implementing SAP as part of this final implementation.
June 22 - Timekeeping functionality will be available for all employees paid 
out of Corporate Payroll in Houston (excluding Azurix employees).
 - New SAP coding must be used on timesheets.
 - System IDs will be available for all new users.
June 30 - DEADLINE!  All time for the period beginning June 16th and ending 
June 30th must be entered into SAP by 3:00 CST.  
 - New SAP coding must be used for all expenses and invoices.
July 5 - All remaining functionality (project management, financials, and 
human resources) are available to new end-users.

Vegas is nice.  It has visibly changed since we were last here.  Lots of new

conference organizers indicated that all speakers presentations would be made 
available at the COGA.org websit after the conference.  However, COGA is 
currently experiencing difficulties in actually getting each speaker to 
provide this information.  I have requested a copy of the Interstate Pipeline 
(CIG/Questar/El Paso/Transcolorado/Western/NWPL) presentations to be mailed 
to me and will circulate them when I receive them.  They provide interesting 
summaries of pipeline expansion programs. 

Main conference themes which seem to be repeated among various speackers 
include the following points:

  -  Annual U.S. domestic requirements are headed towards the 30 TCF point 
sooner than expected.  One attributable reason for the higher than expected 
growth rate was the impact of growing internet & cellular activity of the 
nation.  It was estimated that these combined markets have grown from 
representing 2% of total electrical requirements of the nation to 
approximately an 8-10% range which will be sustainable from this point 
forward.  In addition, overall healthy economic growth of the nation also 
contributes to the increase in domestic gas demand.  
  -   Power River Basin coalbed methane production has the highest potential 
growth opportunity for Rocky production.
 -   Currently the companies most active in Rocky Mountain exploration & 
production are experiencing a shortage of geologists, engineers, and field 
personnel which they fear may impact the desired rate of field  developement 
- Rig counts in the Rockies are on the rise, but additional rig availability 
is also an issue which may impact rate of production.
- The only pipelines which actively promoted access to Waha markets for Rocky 
production were El Paso and Transcolorado.
- El Paso was already encouraging interest in the 1.2 BCF of capacity which 
El Paso Merchant Services currently has on their system which will expire 
October 01. 
- General conference discussion opinion is that the  Alliance in-service 
impact will be fairly neutral to market demand and gas prices for Rocky 
production.  They continue to be optimistic with their growth opportunities 
and price expectations.


Customer Meetings:

Western Gas Resources - met with Bill Koch (project developer), Chris O'Dell 
(Texas gas marketer), Andrew Carter and Andrew Richmond (western region gas 
marketers).  Western is in the process of purchasing some NNG lines which are 
in close proximity to the most southern part of Transwestern's West Texas 
lateral.   Western would eventually like to deliver treated gas into this 
line,  once Traswestern cleans the line and finalizes the Gomez to Puckett 
Tie-Over, in order to access our Waha markets.    Upside potential exists to 
eventually have access to two Western plants  totaling approximately 150 
MMcf/d of supplies through this arrangement.    TW would most likely have to 
enter into some form of transportation agreement with Western in order to 
justify the $2MM price tag for the Gomez to Puckett Tie-Over.

Aquila - Met with Tori Campbell, Goerge Nunnemaker, Mark Magliery and Nick 
Thomas to discuss general TW issues."

located in Colorado Springs, Colorado.  John Rohde purchases gas from 30 
small to medium sized suppliers in the Rocky Mountain area and either acts as 
their agent or moves their purchased gas to markets for NGTS.  Most of this 
gas generally either goes to the Rocky markets or to Northern Natural 
pipeline.  NGTS holds CIG capacity, and I have encouraged John to look at any 
future potential of making deliveries off CIG into TW at Tumbleweed.  John 
also indicated that he thought NGTS does have some equity San Juan gas  which 
currently flows on El Paso to California via capacity release.   I will 
pursue this fact with the proper individual in the Dallas office."

agreement with Burlington, and have determined we may do so only if we take 
the following steps:

1.  Terminate the OBA by giving 30 days notice to Burlington.  Paragraph 13 
of the 6/1/94 OBA with Burlington (as successor in interest to Meridian) 
provides that either party may terminate the OBA ""at the end of the primary 
term, or thereafter by providing thirty (30) days prior written notice"" to 
Burlington.  (The one-month primary term ended June 30, 1994 and has since 
gone month-to-month.)

2.  On the effective termination date of the OBA, terminate the interconnect 
agreement by giving 30 days notice to Burlington.    The 12/31/92 
Interconnect Point Operating Agreement, Paragraph 6, provides that either 
party may terminate on 180 prior notice after expiration of the primary 
term.  This is of limited use to us since the primary term does not expire 
until 12/31/02.  However, the paragraph also provides that the agreement ""may 
be terminated by either party upon thirty (30) days prior written notice in 
the event the OBA between the parties is terminated.""

As we've already discussed, termination of the agreement is an extreme 
measure from a customer relations standpoint and we probably need to weigh 
our other options first.  Let me know if you have further questions."

Just 17 months after announcement of merger plans, Minneapolis-based Northern 
States Power 
and Denver-based New Century Energies have cleared the last hurdle to combine 
under the new 
name Xcel Energy Inc. The merger creates one of the 10 largest electricity 
and natural gas 
companies in the United States. 

The Securities and Exchange Commission issued its approval of the merger, 
wrapping up approvals 
from several federal agencies and states where the companies operate. Xcel 
Energy will serve more 
than 3 million electricity and 1.5 million natural gas customers in 12 
states, and 2 million electricity 
customers internationally. Company headquarters will be in Minneapolis. 
Gradually, the NSP and NCE 
names will be phased out as Xcel Energy provides enhanced products and 
services in 12 states, 
including parts of Minnesota, Colorado, Wisconsin, Texas, Michigan, Kansas, 
Oklahoma, Arizona, New 
Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wyoming. 

Stock will begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Aug. 21, under the 
symbol XEL. Current 
New Century Energies shareholders will receive 1.55 shares of Xcel Energy 
stock for each share of 
NCE they hold. NSP shareholders will get one for one and will not be required 
to exchange their existing 
NSP stock. 

The merger proposal was announced March 25, 1999, and completed in less than 
a year and a half. 
""This has been an incredibly successful merger process,"" said Jim Howard, 
Xcel chairman. ""It demonstrates 
what can be accomplished when regulators, environmentalists, community 
leaders and the merger partners 
all work in a common direction --- to create a better utility company for the 
future."" 

""Our strength will come from a base of millions of customers spread over a 
large area, combined with our 
rapidly growing non-regulated businesses like NRG Energy, now the seventh 
largest independent power 
producer in the world, "" said Wayne Brunetti, Xcel president."

El Paso Explosion Takes 500 MMcf/d Off Market

About 1 Bcf/d of flow on El Paso's South Mainline downstream of Pecos River 
(NM) Station ceased after the 
pipeline exploded early Saturday, killing 10 people and seriously injuring 
two others at a nearby campsite.

El Paso said Monday it was able to compensate for about half that volume 
through a combination of fuel 
switching by downstream customers, maximum storage withdrawals, an OFO and 
other customer cooperation. 

The market reaction was rather predictable as all three California points 
rose by about 35 cents to lead an 
overall price surge. However, utilities in the state did not appear to be 
experiencing any supply problems. 
SoCal Gas said storage and supplies from other Southwest receipt points were 
adequate to avoid any 
problems. A gas operations official for Los Angeles Dept. of Water and Power 
also saw no reason for panic.
approximately 80-feet-long section 
missing from El Paso's line could be ""slapped back into place rather 
quickly."" 

El Paso itself had no estimate for when it can restore service in the 
impacted segment; it must get approval 
rom the federal investigators before beginning repairs or evaluating a 
restart of the adjacent lines. But a large 
aggregator and a marketer agreed with the LADWP official that it should be ""a 
quick mechanical fix"" once 
repairs begin. The aggregator believed downtime could be as short as a week. 

No customers were cut off as a result of the rupture but some were getting 
reduced volumes, an El Paso 
spokeswoman said. 

Northern Natural Gas was seeing a throughput increase of 200-300 MMcf/d 
Monday while Transwestern 
volumes were up 50-75 MMcf/d as a result of shippers diverting gas away from 
El Paso's South Mainline, 
an Enron spokeswoman said. A producer said she diverted as much of her 
company's gas as possible from 
El Paso to Transwestern. 

People were reluctant to trade Permian Basin gas Monday, especially at fixed 
prices, because of doubts 
about how much would be able to flow, several sources said. Permian numbers 
rose a little less than 18 cents 
as part of the general upturn. However, it was Waha prices that saw a bigger 
increase of nearly 30 cents as a 
result. ""Everything in El Paso-Permian's Keystone pool was going back into 
Waha,"" said a marketer, putting 
Waha in the mid $4.60s at a premium of more than a nickel above Henry Hub. 

The Southern California border, at an average of nearly $5.30, led the rest 
of Monday's market by a large margin. 
Before trading began, EnronOnline was offering border swing swaps for the 
rest of the month at $5.85-95, a 
marketer said. With swing swaps priced so high, it gave sellers more 
confidence in what prices they could 
command in the day market, he said. ""Either way, I wouldn't want to be short 
right now at the border."" 

There were lots of rumors but no facts available on what caused the El Paso 
rupture, noted one aggregator. 
""But it's a good thing it didn't happen until after California had cooled 
off. Otherwise I could easily have seen 
the border basis spread from San Juan Basin go as high as $2.50"" instead of 
the approximate gap of $1.70 
egistered Monday by Daily GPI. 

A knowledgeable source provided his analyis of the blast: The structure of 
the crater made the rupture ""look 
like a line integrity problem from the way it blew out."" The earth can harbor 
leaking gas for a while until eventually 
everything all goes up at once. People nearby would not have detected 
anything because gas is odorless in 
long-haul lines; the mercaptan odorant is not added until it gets to the 
local distribution stage. Pipeline safety 
surveyors usually will look for dead vegetation in the vicinity to detect a 
leak, but this was a desert area with very 
little vegetation. It is easily possible for escaping gas to hug the ground 
for the approximate 500-foot distance to 
the victims' campsite and seek an ignition source there. It is a normal 
tendency for gas leaking into the atmosphere 
to stay close to the ground, and that tendency would have been amplied by the 
chilliness of the pre-dawn desert. 

The source went on to say, ""I think there will be lot more of this [ruptures] 
in the future with many pipes becoming at 
least 40-50 years old."" El Paso was unlucky in experiencing one of the early 
incidents, he said, because the situation 
applies to the other lines with old pipe. Pipelines used to spend a lot more 
money on maintenance when regulation 
was tighter and they were still paying for depreciation, he said. ""Now

interview with Alliance personnel

Construction Completed on Alliance Pipeline

The C$4.6 billion Alliance natural gas and liquids pipeline, designed to 
transport 1.325 Bcf/d from northeast 
British Columbia to Chicago, has completed its construction phase and now is 
commissioning the main line, 
laterals, compressors and supervisory equipment. 

The final weld was completed last week near Regina, SK, and Alliance now is 
injecting linepack. The 1,857 
mile mainline is stretched to the Chicago area from northeastern BC. October 
is still the target month to begin 
service of the pipeline, which will carry both natural gas and liquids. 

The pipeline system will transport natural gas through a 36-inch diameter 
high-pressure line. There will be 14 
mainline compressor stations: seven in Canada and seven in the U.S. When it 
began construction in 1999, 
Alliance already had commitments from 37 shippers for 15-year contracts worth 
a total of $8.2 billion.

The large volumes of gas Alliance will haul from western Canada into the U.S. 
Midwest is expected to have 
a major impact on existing pipelines, markets and prices. TransCanada 
PipeLines already has filed for new 
tolls to compensate for customers which have failed to renew firm contracts 
on its line and instead are routing 
their gas through Alliance. New gas that makes its way into the Chicago area 
could be sent on to southern 
Ontario through the Chicago-to-Dawn Vector Pipeline, scheduled to open in 
late October with intial capacity 
of 720 Bcf/d.  The Foothills/Northern Border route from western Canada into 
the Midwest also is expected to 
see some slack. 

Alliance spokesman Jay Godfrey said last month that ""when October comes we 
won't be in the position that 
we'll have to start filling the pipe. It essentially already is going to be 
full."" Connections to 37 gas plants are 
already complete. 

Investors in Alliance Pipeline Limited Partnerships include affiliates of 
Coastal (14.4%), Enbridge (21.4%), 
Fort Chicago Energy Partners LP (26%), Williams (14.6%) and Westcoast Energy 
(23.6%)."

the market dynamics affecting the Needles to Topock price differentials.  
Each customer focused more on the supply side dynamics of Topock gas 
supplies, rather than the incremental intra-state transport costs required to 
transport to the PG&E citygate, as the primary driving force for the Needles 
to Topock  price differential.    

Here is a recurring theme I heard from my customers:  The El Paso Merchant 
Service (EPMS) 1.2 BCF contract's Block II capacity (500 MMcf/d of Permian to 
PG&E/Topock capacity,  $.065 transport rate) has a re-callable aspect.  If 
EPMS schedules gas under the transport of Block II capacity to any other 
California delivery point other than PG&E/Topock, then other parties may 
recall the capacity for their own use to PG&E/Topock.  Currently Duke has 
recalled 100 MMcf/d and PG&E Energy Trading has also recalled 100 MMcf/d for 
their use to transport Permian gas to PG&E/Topock. (FYI - EPMC may re-recall 
this capacity, but they have elected not to).  These additional Topock 
supplies coming from Duke and PG&E Energy Trading under Block II capacity may 
be viewed as providing an oversupply of gas to PG&E at Topock.  This gas 
competes head to head with Malin gas prices.  For example, today's Malin 
price is $4.62 while PG&E/Topock price is $4.69.    Today's cash price 
differential between Needles and Topock is $.60, far larger than the 
previously assumed $.28 differential resulting from the intrastate cost 
required to bring Topock gas to the citygate.    

If anyone else had additional market information or opinions regarding these 
market dynamics, let's discuss further at our next staff meeting. CS"

The U.S. Transportation Department's Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS) has 
ordered all three of the pipes comprising El Paso Natural Gas' 1 Bcf/d South 
Mainline from Texas to California to remain closed until extensive tests can 
be done to ensure they are safe to operate. 

The order came in the wake of Saturday's explosion and fire that ripped 
through one of those lines, the 30-inch pipeline 1103, at a Pecos River 
crossing near Carlsbad, NM, killing 11 people. 

Because of the internal corrosion discovered on the failed section of 
pipeline, OPS is directing El Paso to submit a corrective action plan for OPS 
approval that will identify all areas on approximately 330 miles of pipeline 
that may be subject to internal corrosion,"" said Kelley S. Coyner, head of 
the Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA) for the OPS, in a 
prepared statement. 

The DOT ""is requiring that all segments of the three pipelines in the 
vicinity of Pecos River remain closed until such time that the department has 
determined that the pipeline segments are safe to operate."" This is necessary 
to ""protect the public and the environment and to prevent a similar failure 
on this pipeline system."" 

The plan will require inspection, assessment, and repair or replacement of 
all damaged areas. 

""Based on the results of these and other tests, El Paso must develop a plan 
to assess the integrity of the remainder of its 10,000 mile pipeline system."" 

The OPS ""Corrective Action Order"" was issued late Wednesday, after El Paso 
officials had been saying for most of the day it was only a matter of hours 
before at least one of the lines was back in operation. One industry source 
said testing could easily take three weeks to a month, even if no repairs are 
necessary. 

The OPS order directs El Paso to: 1) conduct hydrostatic pressure testing of 
the lines; 2) perform a direct assessment of the integrity of the pipelines 
by both X-ray and ultrasonic examinations; and 3) because internal corrosion 
has been detected in the failed section of the pipeline, El Paso also must 
submit a corrective action plan to OPS identifying all areas on the 
approximately 330 miles of pipeline that may have internal corrosion. 

Even if El Paso passes all these tests and OPS allows it to return to 
service, each of the three lines will be subject to a 20% pressure 
restriction, according to Coyner. The restriction will be reviewed in 10 
working days, and may be removed upon the receipt of more information about 
the factors that contributed to the Aug. 19 explosion. OPS has the authority 
to take other actions if warranted. 

The OPS yesterday issued the seven-page corrective action order, which 
permits it to suspend or restrict the operations of a pipeline, after it 
determined that the El Paso lines were hazardous. El Paso has been notified 
of the order, and it has 10 days to request a hearing to be held in either 
Houston or Washington DC. If El Paso fails to comply with any part of the 
order, it could face civil penalties of up to $25,000 a day, and the case 
could be referred to the U.S. Attorney General for ""appropriate relief"" in 
the U.S. District Court, according to Stacey Gerard, associate administrator 
for pipeline safety. 

Preliminary investigations of ruptured Line 1103 by the OPS and the National 
Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) indicate that ""significant internal 
corrosion was visible on the failed section. Internal corrosion may have been 
a contributing factor in the line failure. The possibility of internal 
corrosion on other lines in the area is a safety concern."" 

The OPS order applies to the 30-inch Line 1103, which incurred the most 
damage, and the parallel 26-inch Line 1100 that ""sustained an undetermined 
amount of damage at the Pecos River crossing due to the fire."" It also covers 
the adjacent 30-inch Line 1110, whose damages are still undetermined. Lines 
1103 and 1110 were built in 1950, and Line 1100 in 1947. 

Within 90 days, El Paso will be required to submit to the OPS Southwest 
region director an ""analysis of the continued safe operation"" of the three 
lines ""based on the testing and inspection required under this order."" 

In related action. Rep. John Dingell (D-MI), who has been a sharp critic of 
OPS for its allegedly lax handling of pipeline safety violators, is in the 
process of drafting a letter to the agency to determine whether its failure 
to take aggressive action towards pipelines may have created an atmosphere 
that led to the tragedy on El Paso."

and David Roentsch regarding TW's pressures and delivery capability at SoCal 
Needles.  Analysis indicates we have 35 pounds of pressure drop from our 
Needles measurement station to the SoCal station across the river 
(approximately two miles).  SoCal maintains that if we can give them 830 psi 
at their station, they can take the full 750,000 MMBtu under the contract 
(this translates to 870 psi at TW's meter with our current situation).  Our 
problem has been if we lose volume out of San Juan or a unit on the West of 
Thoreau leg, then we lose line pack and then pressure at the border.  SoCal 
acknowledges they have a motor out of service at Needles but plan to have it 
back on line in October.  But they maintain this won't help resolve the 
situation.  Operations has agreed to look at a number of things including 
changing the type of meter at Needles, looking at some station valve 
replacement, and mechanical condition of stations 1 through 4.  Marketing 
agreed to estimate the revenue impact of the pressure drop and lower volume 
delivery to help justify any capital expenditures."

Aquila Energy said it has been awarded a $550 million long-term contract to 
supply 154 Bcf of natural gas over 12 years to members of the American Public 
Energy Agency (APEA). It is the fourth contract the agency has awarded to 
Aquila since 1998. 

""With the future of gas prices becoming more and more unknown because of 
increasing demands and tightening supply, our members will benefit greatly 
from this long-term contract,"" said Roger Mock, president and chief executive 
officer of APEA. 

Under the three previous contracts with APEA Aquila is supplying the agency 
with 14.4 Bcf of gas over ten years, 91 Bcf over 12 years and 141 Bcf over 12 
years. All together, Aquila is providing APEA with more than 400 Bcf over the 
next 12 years. 

APEA provides a reliable supply of natural gas to many municipal utilities 
and other public entities throughout the United States. These public buyers 
serve thousands of homes and businesses. 

""Our strategy is to provide our customers with the most effective portfolio 
of services, both financially and physically, to enhance their competitive 
position in managing their energy needs,"" said Tom McCarthy, vice president 
of structured transactions for Aquila Energy."

irrigation.  After we have begun to research the Other variables we may have 
to come back to you and discuss proxy variables so keep that in mind.  We

PanCanadian Says Montana Power Purchase 'Beautiful Fit'

To extend what it sees as dominance in Canada's natural gas market and to 
boost its production by 10%, PanCanadian Petroleum Ltd. yesterday agreed to 
purchase Montana Power Co. for $475 million. The properties will extend 
PanCanadian's existing shallow gas properties in southern Alberta into 
northern Montana, adding 94 MMcf/d and 3,800 barrels of crude oil and natural 
gas liquids. 

The acquisition will give PanCanadian properties in Alberta, Montana, 
Colorado, Oklahoma and Wyoming, along with three gas pipelines linking 
Alberta and Saskatchewan to Montana. 

""We have a focus on natural gas,"" said CEO David Tuer during a conference 
call yesterday in Calgary. ""This is clearly our future. It is difficult to 
put any negative on this (acquisition) and it's likely to stay valuable for 
the foreseeable future."" 

Montana Power's production is more than 90% natural gas and associated 
liquids, and the acquisition substantially extends PanCanadian's land and 
infrastructure, allowing it to use its technology and operating strategies in 
a region that extends along the Alberta-Montana border. 

""The Montana Power assets clearly fit our strengths and allow us to employ 
our expertise in developing long life reserves of shallow and medium depth 
natural gas,"" Tuer said. ""The potential in these assets is significant, and 
over the next few years, we will add substantially to PanCanadian's daily 
natural gas production."" 

Tuer said that the acquisition extends the company's dominance in shallow 
gas, and called Montana Power a ""beautiful fit with PanCanadian's gas 
strategy, land position and technological capability."" 

PanCanadian's newest acquisition adds reserves of 550 Bcf and 20 MM barrels 
of oil and natural gas liquids on a proven and one-half probable basis, said 
officials. Production and reserves account for $520 million of the purchase 
price, while the remainder is made up of $135 million for the midstream and 
marketing assets, $40 million for the undeveloped land (about 600,000 acres), 
and $7 million of working capital. 

Tuer said the company was paying 77 cents/Mcfe of proven and on-half probable 
reserves. The price for daily flowing production, based on a 6:1 ration of 
gas to BOE is $4,450/Mcfe, or $26,710/BOE. 

Along with the added Alberta and Montana properties, PanCanadian also picks 
up some land in Colorado's Denver Basin, which now produces about 31 MMcf/d. 
Other land that is part of the sale is located in the Anadarko Basin of 
Oklahoma and the Green River Basin of Wyoming. 

Three natural gas pipelines that cross from Montana into Alberta and 
Saskatchewan also are included. The pipelines allow direct access to the U.S. 
markets for southern Alberta and Saskatchewan gas, and serve more than 1.2 
million net acres of developed and undeveloped lands, with most of it 
concentrated in parcels that span the Canada-Montana border. 

Midstream assets that go to PanCanadian include a natural gas marketing 
company in Butte, MT, along with a deep cut gas processing and fractionation 
plant in Colorado. The Fort Lupton, CO plant processes more than 60 MMcf/d 
and 5,500 barrels of natural gas liquids and condensate. 

In all, the total developed and undeveloped land is roughly 1.2 million net 
acres, or 1.7 million gross acres, said PanCanadian. 

""Montana Power fit us like a glove,"" Tuer said during the conference call. He 
said the acquisition will help PanCanadian to remain ""best of class"" for what 
it does. ""It makes our sandbox that much bigger."" 

The acquisition, which is expected to close around Oct. 31, will increase 
both PanCanadian's net income and cash flow this year and in subsequent 
years, said Tuer. The added gas production will immediately increase the 
company's natural gas, as a percentage of total production, to 58%, based on 
a 6:1 ratio of gas to BOE. 

About 25% of the natural gas being acquired from Montana Power now is being 
sold to Montana Power utilities for $1.50 to $1.60 MMcf until July 2002, and 
because it's priced below the open market officials think future earnings 
will be good. 

""As that contract expires, there's a lot of potential from the price in this 
transaction,"" Tuer said. 

And what's to become of Montana Power? Earlier this year, the 88-year-old 
company, headquartered in Butte, announced it would divest itself of four of 
its traditional energy businesses. By selling its coal production, natural 
gas transmission and distribution, independent power production and oil and 
gas exploration and production businesses, it plans to reinvest the proceeds 
in Touch America, a fiber optics and telecommunications business, which is 
also a subsidiary of Montana Power. 

""The process to determine the buyer for our oil and gas business was robust, 
and we are delighted with the result,"" said Montana Power CEO Robert P. 
Gannon. ""We believe there will be a meshing of business strategies and that 
cultural synergy's exist between the purchased companies and Pan Canadian."" 
He noted that Montana Power has had a Canadian presence for almost 50 years. 

PanCanadian purchased the entire oil and gas division, which now employs 
about 170. PanCanadian plans to maintain a regional office in Butte, invest 
in the acquired properties and grow daily gas production. There was no word 
on whether any jobs would be lost."

,09/01/2000,,kevin.hyatt@enron.com,bullets@enron.com,,Bullets 9/1,"El Paso Pipeline Update - The US Dept. of Transportation approved reinstating 
gas service for El Paso's Line 1100 damaged in the recent explosion.  This 
brought 400 million cfd of capacity back on stream to the California border.  
The ruptured Line 1103 will not be repaired until further investigations have 
been completed.  The availability of Line 1100 capacity had the following 
basis impact:  Permian to California basis for October dropped from Monday by 
$1.30/MMBtu while November '00 - March '01 and April - October '01 narrowed 
by $0.43 and $0.37 respectively.  Also, TW shippers are no longer using El 
Paso Window Rock as a receipt point on our system.

Transport Options Program - Representatives from 7 companies comprising a 
majority of TW's larger shippers attended our workshop on this new tariff 
filing.  All attendees were given in advance of the meeting a draft copy of 
the proposed filing for their review and comment.  The TW Team (Jeff Fawcett 
and Susan Scott) did an outstanding job of preparing the material, answering 
questions, and anticipating shipper concerns related to this new service.  
The only serious objections raised  by the customers were concerns related 
to: (1) potential abuses by marketing affiliates and (2) hoarding of option 
capacity by any one shipper.  Among the  solutions proposed were restricting 
Enron affiliates  access to the program and limiting the volume of 
outstanding options any one shipper can hold.  At the end of the meeting, we 
asked for final comments to be submitted to TW by next week in anticipation 
of filing the tariff with the FERC in mid-September.

KN/Oneok Contract -  We negotiated a 12 month max rate agreement with Oneok 
for 20,000 MMBtu/d of west flow capacity starting February 1, 2001.  We also 
negotiated in the contract a provision whereby if Oneok releases any of the 
capacity above the max rate, then TW shares 50/50 in the incremental revenue.

EOG Resources - We are negotiating a new transport agreement with EOG for 
incremental volume they could bring into TW's West Texas lateral.  Initially, 
the volume was 4 - 5,000 MMBtu/d but now may be at least 15,000 MMBtu/d.  EOG 
is reviewing the proposed interconnect and operating agreement.  EOG has not 
typically held transport capacity on TW in the past.

September Pipe Outage - We are trying to accommodate west flowing shippers 
whose transport will be cut from September 6-10 due to DOT testing on 
Transwestern.  The plan is to facilitate the use of PG&E Market Center 
storage to supply west markets during the outage.  Volume may be as high as 
20 -50,000 MMBtu/d at an incremental rate for TW of $.05 -.08/MMBtu."

units will not implement self-service it at this time.  Your timekeeper will 
still be responsible for entering your payroll information i.e. vacation, 
sick.  Because of the upcoming July 3-4 holiday and more importantly the new 
SAP timekeeping system your timesheets should be submitted to your timekeeper 
as soon after June 23 as possible.  This will be the first time entry period 
via SAP and we want to insure that everything is entered correctly.  The new

Commercial 
and regulatory representatives of BP-Amoco, Burlington, Conoco, Coral, 
Dynegy, Phillips and Reliant attended.  After a brief overview of the 
proposed filing, TW opened the floor for questions and comments.  Here is a 
summary of the comments.

Marketing affiliate concerns.  BP's regulatory representative expressed 
concern that TW's marketing affiliates would be able to use options to game 
the system.  In BP's example, since TW and ENA are both Enron companies, ENA 
could purchase an ""out of the money"" call option essentially cost free, since 
its affiliate (TW) would have the ability to buy the option back.  Proceeds 
from ENA's ability to then ""move the market"" through the establishment of the 
long basis position would go directly to Enron's bottom line.  BP suggested 
that TW's marketing affiliates be banned from purchasing options, or that the 
marketing affiliate be required to credit 100% of the option proceeds to 
other shippers.  Although BP admits that Transwestern's prior dealings with 
ENA have not been suspect, BP fears that TW's filing will set a precedent for 
other pipelines to offer a similar service.  Since TW will be the first 
pipeline to offer such services, BP wants TW's program to be as restricted as 
possible.  Dynegy echoed BP's concern regarding possible affiliate abuse, but 
rather than shelve the program entirely, Dynegy reiterated an earlier 
suggestion that Transwestern be required to credit back the difference 
between the option fee paid by an affiliate and the next highest bidder, if 
the affiliate's bid exceeds the next highest by a certain percentage.  

TW's response was that while actual abuse of an options program by a 
marketing affiliate may be a legitimate concern, owing to its unassailable 
record in this area, TW should be entitled to a presumption that it has 
complied and will continue to comply with Commission policy covering the sale 
of capacity to marketing affiliates, and was not inclined to voluntarily 
include any limitations on the options program.  If BP and others have 
serious concerns regarding the Commission's overall policy on marketing 
affiliates, those issues should be raised in a separate proceeding that 
applies to all interstate pipelines.

Right of first refusal.  Burlington asked whether options would replace the 
right of first refusal.  TW's  response was that ROFR will still be available 
pursuant to the terms and conditions of our tariff.

Negotiated rate.  BP's representative claimed that option contracts will 
constitute a negotiated rate and that each deal will need to be filed as 
such.  TW did not respond to this or discuss it further.  However, TW's 
position at this point is that since the option fee is part of the 
transportation rate, transportation deals that include the option amendment 
will only be considered negotiated rate deals if the total rate including the 
option fee exceeds the maximum transport rate.  

Hoarding capacity.  Using the recent large block sale of capacity on El Paso 
as an example, several customers expressed concern that the options program 
would make it easier for a shipper to hoard capacity.  It was not clear why 
some of the workshop participants thought that the sale of options would 
create more opportunity for hoarding capacity than already exists.  Perhaps 
because the option fee is a lesser cost than the transport rate for the 
underlying capacity, their perception was that options would simply make 
hoarding cheaper and easier.  TW acknowledged that the potential for 
withholding capacity from the market is one reason for FERC's current policy 
against reserving capacity for shippers.  Although TW did not commit to 
placing any limits on the either the quantity of capacity or options for 
capacity that any one shipper may own, it is possible that FERC may require 
TW to do so in a final order.

Our plan is to meet with PG&E and SoCalGas in California the week of 
September 11 to go over details of the program, and to finalize the FERC 
filing by mid-September."

,09/05/2000,,chris.smith@enron.com,s_houston@enron.com,,GPG Windows 2000/Outlook Project Announcement,"GPG will begin gathering information in September for our migration to 
Windows 2000 and Outlook/Exchange.

Windows 2000 (or W2K) is Microsoft's newest operating system and has been 
selected as Enron's standard desktop operating system.  Along with this 
change, we are moving from Lotus Notes to Outlook/Exchange as our standard 
messaging (email) application.  

This project is a huge undertaking, and we need everyone,s assistance to 
ensure success.  The GPG-IT team will partner with each group to ensure every 
aspect is covered.   Each group (IT and the User group) will assign a Point 
of Contact (POC) to  work with the IT group.  The POC's responsibilities 
include application information gathering, identifying security requirements, 
documenting all issues and concerns, and communicating project status.

We are approaching the Windows 2000/Exchange Project in a phased approach.

Phase I, starting now and running through November, consists of &Information 
Gathering8 about hardware, applications, issues, as well as application 
testing in our Windows 2000 lab and user sign-off.  The Phase I findings will 
determine the Phase II start date.

Phase II, will be the actual &Implementation8 of desktop hardware, Windows 
2000 and Outlook software, and user training.  We will also be migrating 
""user"" data on the network to a Windows 2000 file server and migrating 
applications to a Windows 2000 application server. 

Some of the benefits of migrating to W2K
Increased desktop reliability and response time.  Windows 2000 is much more 
stable and robust than Windows 95/98/NT.
Increased system performance because minimum hardware requirements for W2K 
are 350 MHz and above with 256 MEG memory.  
Increased desktop manageability and enhanced functionality.  
Single sign-on for all users/servers.  No more problems with trying to keep 
all your LAN and email passwords the same!

Some of the impacts to migrating to W2K
Some of the old Office (Word, Excel, PowerPoint or Access) documents will 
need to be updated.  If you have any old documents that you think will not 
move forward to W2K, please communicate this to your IT POC. 
We are aware that some hardware and applications may have problems running in 
Windows 2000.  We will work together to find a suitable solution for 
everyone.  

Another communication with much more detail regarding W2K and Outlook will be 
coming soon.  

If you have any questions, comments or issues, as always, please feel free to 
contact your GPG support group directly.

Thanks.

Less than two weeks after the deadly explosion on El Paso Natural Gas' system 
in southeastern New Mexico, the pipeline last week had more than 700 MMcf/d 
of its 1.1 Bcf/d capacity restored to its South Mainline that services 
markets between Texas and California. 

At mid-day Friday, El Paso said it began running about 260 MMcf/d through 
Line 1100 after it received the go-ahead from the federal Office of Pipeline 
Safety (OPS), according to spokeswoman Kim Wallace. El Paso was able to 
re-start partial service on the 26-inch line after it built a 16-inch 
temporary connector line between Line 1110 and Line 1100, which was approved 
by OPS. 

The temporary connector was installed just east of the Pecos River explosion 
site, about 30 miles from Carlsbad, NM. Wallace said Line 1100 would carry 
the gas from Eunice, NM, just Northeast of the Pecos River Compressor 
Station, to the connector with Line 1110, which then would transport it 
westward across the Pecos River Bridge where it would meet up with Line 1100 
further downstream. Meanwhile, Wallace said El Paso submitted to OPS last 
week the test results and a preliminary return-to-service plan for Line 1100. 

Three days prior, the OPS had given El Paso permission to restore service to 
Line 1110 from the Keystone Station through the Pecos River Compressor 
Station at a reduced level. The pipeline re-opened the line at about 400 
MMcf/d, and gradually increased it to 480 MMcf/d by Friday. This is ""still 
within the limits it [OPS] set"" for Line 1110, Wallace said. 

The OPS restricted El Paso's Line 1110 to 80% of the operating pressure of 
Line 1103 at the time it ruptured, according to Department of Transportation 
spokeswoman Debbie Hinz. She said this put the line at a pressure of about 
538 pounds per square inch. 

The OPS-ordered shutdown of Line 1110 lasted 10 days, during which the agency 
ordered El Paso to conduct extensive hydrostatic, ultrasound and X-ray tests 
to determine its safety, and to submit a plan for restoring service to the 
line. 

As for the future of ruptured Line 1103, Wallace said repairs on it would not 
begin until after the investigation of the explosion is completed, which will 
""probably be nine to 12 months."" 

The restoration of service couldn't come soon enough for El Paso customers 
who have been scrambling for transportation capacity ever since federal 
investigators and regulators closed down the three lines that make up El 
Paso's South Main leg in the wake of the blast that killed 11 people and 
critically injured one. California customers have been taking gas out of 
storage to meet their needs during the service interruption. The Department 
of Energy has set up a task force to evaluate the effects of the explosion 
and shutdown on the gas market."

Southern California Edison filed a motion late last week with the California 
Public Utility Commission seeking emergency relief from high spot gas prices 
on which its power purchase rates are based. The company told the CPUC that 
Southern California Border (Topock, AZ) prices in the last month have risen 
by $2.50/MMBtu possibly because of market manipulation, in particular the 
withholding off of the market of pipeline transportation capacity between the 
supply basins and the California border. 

""[T]here is substantial and compelling evidence that the basis differential 
has been and continues to be grossly distorted by market power abuse, 
collusion and affiliate self dealing of out-of-state gas suppliers and 
merchants,"" Edison told the CPUC. 

The company noted the CPUC already has filed a Section 5 complaint with FERC 
regarding this issue and is seeking a recision of ""certain allegedly 
collusive contracts which it contends have permitted out-of-state natural gas 
suppliers and their affiliates to drive up artificially California border gas 
prices by wrongfully withholding capacity."" It notes the complaint 
""conservatively estimates that the anti-competitive manipulation of the basis 
differential has already damaged California gas and electricity users by $100 
million annually since the beginning of 1998."" 

Edison seeks an expedited order authorizing it to use the posted gas price of 
$4.5133/MMBtu, which was applied to SCE's August 2000 avoided cost posting, 
to calculate its payment obligations to qualified power producers for the 
month of October and every month going forward. It estimated September 
bidweek border prices would average $7/MMBtu. If such prices were used in 
Edison's September avoided costs posting, its Transition Formula payments to 
certain independent power producers will be $29 million more than the month 
prior, the company told the CPUC. ""No mechanism exists to recapture the 
increase in such payments if it is later determined by this commission or in 
another forum that the Topock border indices are unreliable at this time."""

By today, a ""cool"" spell was expected to grip Texas, plunging temperatures 
down to around 100. A nice respite from the 105-plus temperatures that 
stilled the state and sent electricity peak loads to new records last week 
for the third time this year. 

The Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), an industry coalition that 
administers the state's power grid and serves 85% of the state's electric 
load, reported Friday that preliminary numbers indicated that electricity 
usage reached an all-time peak high for the third time in 44 days last 
Thursday, with Texans using 57,731 MW of power. Of course, that was before 
the weekend, when temperatures were expected to climb as high as 112 at some 
locations in the state --- just in time for Labor Day picnics. 

The new usage record last Thursday broke the previous record set the day 
before, on Wednesday, when consumers used 55,994 MW of power. The two broken 
records broke a record set just six weeks earlier, July 19, when Texans used 
55,796 MW of power. 

Peak load in August 1999 was 54,849 MW of power, while peak load in August 
1998 was 53,689 MW of power."

With gas futures prices soaring past $5, now is not a bad time to raise price 
forecasts and expectations for the coming winter and next year. Prudential 
Securities did just that yesterday, upping its predictions on spot wellhead 
prices to $4.10 for the second half of the year, $3.55 for all of 2000 and 
$3.65 for 2001. 

""[W]e believe the natural gas industry could continue its bullish run for 
another two years or more and the next 18 months look like a 'lay up,'"" the 
investment banking firm said in its latest quarterly report on natural gas 
fundamentals. Below average storage inventories and increasing gas-fired 
electric generation demand should keep the bull market running, the report 
stated. 

Prudential expects storage to end the injection season at about 2,660 Bcf, or 
11% below last year's level. ""This is assuming that the average injection 
rate is at or above the eight-year historical average during that period, and 
so far this year refills have been at or below the historical average. 
Depending on the winter weather, the industry typically consumes 2,000-2,500 
Bcf out of storage inventories, which would likely bring storage levels down 
close to record lows next spring."" 

Prudential expects supply tightness to continue even with the addition of the 
1.325 Bcf/d Alliance project, which is due to come on line next month. ""[W]e 
question whether the Alliance pipeline will add incremental supplies to the 
U.S. or simply displace gas supply out of the Alberta region currently 
flowing down the TransCanada pipeline system."" Prudential predicts Alliance 
will open up Oct. 2 with 600-700 MMcf/d of gas flowing. ""The perception of 
the continued tightness in the gas supply picture is likely to result in an 
increase in volatility in natural gas prices."" 

Prudential also estimates that 1.5 Bcf/d of gas demand has been added this 
summer by new gas-fired power plants going on line. ""Over the past few weeks, 
over 2,400 MW of new merchant capacity has been added to the grid, equating 
to about 480 MMcf/d of capacity. Earlier in the summer, 3,600 MW came on line 
and another 1,780 MW started up in May. In aggregate, about 7,800 MW of new 
summer generation load could collectively consume 1.5 Bcf/d, which is likely 
to be diverted from storage injections."" 

The firm estimates that wellhead deliverability will pick up significantly. 
The rig count has grown 48% since last year. Production from the deep-water 
Gulf of Mexico is expected to add 3.6-4 Bcf/d of new supply, ""more than 
offsetting the deliverability decline, but shy of total expected new demand. 
We forecast gas demand will rise 3.1% in 2001, fueled by growth in merchant 
power generation."" 

Prudential noted that on the books is another 37,000 MW of additional new 
gas-fired generation capacity to be installed next year and 43,200 MW in 
2002."

capital and direct resources towards our highest return businesses, David 
Haug, Chairman and CEO of Enron CALME, Jim Hughes, President and COO of Enron 
APACHI, Joe Kishkill, Managing Director of Enron South America, and Frank 
Stabler, formerly a Managing Director of Enron CALME, will join Mark Metts in 
a corporate wide effort, to help monetize some of Enron,s assets.  David will 
help transition the CALME business activities into other parts of Enron while 
working with Mark on the asset monetization projects.  David will continue as 
an Executive Vice President for Enron Corp and a member of Enron,s Executive 
Committee.  Cliff Baxter will oversee this effort.

Consistent with these changes, the CALME group will be divided as follows.  
Enron Global LNG and Enron,s Caribbean Basin activities will become part of 
the new Enron Global Markets (EGM) group headed by Mike McConnell.  Rick 
Bergsieker, President/COO of LNG will continue in that role and in his dual 
role as President/COO of Enron Middle East, which will also join EGM. Shawn 
Cumberland, President and COO of the Caribbean Basin unit and his executive 
team will carry out the transition process for the Caribbean business unit's 
people and businesses as part of EGM.  Management of its Colombia and 
Venezuela businesses will transfer to Enron South America and its LNG-related 
activities to EGM as described above. 

The EES related initiatives and people will be transferred to those units.  
All of the various international businesses will participate as usual in the 
upcoming budget process with their new alignment and continue to meet their 
plan targets for 3rd and 4th quarters.

Concurrently, we are consolidating our trading and merchant activities in 
Japan and Australia into Enron Europe.  Joe Hirl and Paul Quilkey will report 
to Enron Europe,s Office of the Chairman.

We congratulate David Haug and Rebecca McDonald for proposing these 
realignments, which we agree, will maximize both the financial and 
intellectual capital in Enron.  Over the coming weeks, specific assignments 
and reporting relationships will be determined and communicated."

Main Line West Outage - West flow capacity has been reduced by approximately 
200,000 MMBtu/d for five days beginning 9/6 for pipeline testing.  To 
accommodate the market and customer needs, we have negotiated transport for 
50,000 MMBtu/day from PG&E to Needles for Max Rate of $.25 for the five day 
outage.  We also did a Market Center lend for 40,000 MMBtu/day @ $0.10.  
Estimated incremental revenue for the 5 day outage at this time is $82,500.  

KN/Oneok Contract -  We negotiated a 12 month max rate agreement with Oneok 
for 20,000 MMBtu/d of west flow capacity starting February 1, 2001.  We also 
negotiated in the contract a provision whereby if Oneok releases any of the 
capacity above the max rate, then TW shares 50/50 in the incremental 
revenue.  All executed documents have been received.

FERC / California Power Prices - The FERC plans to convene a public meeting 
the week of September 11 in California to take comments from interested 
parties regarding the recent price spikes of wholesale electricity and power 
transmission in the state.  In addition, SoCal Edison filed a motion late 
last week with the California Public Utility Commission seeking emergency 
relief from high spot gas prices on which its power purchase rates are based. 
The company told the CPUC that Southern California Border (Topock, AZ) prices 
in the last month have risen by $2.50/MMBtu possibly because of market 
manipulation, in particular the withholding off of the market of pipeline 
transportation capacity between the supply basins and the California border. 

""There is substantial and compelling evidence that the basis differential has 
been and continues to be grossly distorted by market power abuse, collusion 
and affiliate self dealing of out-of-state gas suppliers and merchants,"" 
Edison told the CPUC. 

The company noted the CPUC already has filed a Section 5 complaint with FERC 
regarding this issue and is seeking a recision of ""certain allegedly 
collusive contracts which it contends have permitted out-of-state natural gas 
suppliers and their affiliates to drive up artificially California border gas 
prices by wrongfully withholding capacity."" It notes the complaint 
""conservatively estimates that the anti-competitive manipulation of the basis 
differential has already damaged California gas and electricity users by $100 
million annually since the beginning of 1998."" 

Jeff Dasovich from the Enron California office will attend the FERC meeting."

The Energy Information Administration said yesterday in its September 
Short-Term Energy Outlook it is projecting natural gas prices at the wellhead 
will increase by about 87% this winter (October-March) compared to last 
winter. Residential prices for gas are expected to rise on average by 27% 
compared to last year. For the entire year, the average wellhead price for 
natural gas is projected to be $3.40/Mcf, the highest annual wellhead price 
on record (in inflation-adjusted terms, it would be the highest annual 
average price since 1985). 

The short-term supply constraints that are currently hindering the industry's 
ability to meet storage and power generation demand at the same time are 
likely to continue into the heating season, EIA said. Storage levels could 
end up being about 8% below the five-year average of about 3,000 Bcf by the 
start of winter if net injections continue at 10% below historically average 
rates through the remainder of the refill season. 

The effects of increased drilling for gas are not expected to appear in the 
form of significantly increased production until after the next heating 
season, according to the agency's report. 

""For now, we are continuing to maintain a conservative view of possible 
increases in domestic gas production for 2000 and 2001, with assumed 
increases of 0.5% and 1%, respectively, for this year and next...,"" the EIA 
report stated. ""On the other hand, the U.S. natural gas rig count on Aug. 25 
was at a recent high of 794 rigs. Exploration and production budgets for many 
natural gas producers are expected to increase sharply in 2000 and 2001, 
spurred by higher prices and greatly improved current and expected revenues 
from producing assets. Also on the positive side, data from the Texas 
Railroad Commission suggest that, through May, year 2000 gas production 
increased, if only slightly (0.4%). This signifies a turnaround (however 
modest) in a key producing region. Very high gas drilling rates, including a 
record-setting pace in deep offshore Gulf of Mexico, confirm that 
increasingly positive results for domestic gas production are under way."" 

Imports are projected to rise by about 12% next year primarily because of the 
1.35 Bcf/d Alliance Pipeline coming on line next month. 

Meanwhile the demand outlook remains bullish at 4.2% annual growth. In 2001, 
however, the forecast has been revised downward to 2.5% growth because of 
higher than expected natural gas prices. The industrial sector is the leading 
sector for demand increases in 2000 at 9.3%, while electric utility demand is 
expected to decline by 4.0% primarily because of power plant sales. For the 
power generation sector as a whole, gas demand is expected to grow 6.5% this 
year and 1.5% in 2001. EIA said the reduced growth rate next year is largely 
due to the reversal in relative prices of fuel oil and natural gas, which 
began in August, with fuel oil gaining the price advantage as gas prices 
continued to rise. 

Gas demand this winter is expected to be up by 5.7% compared to last winter

the process, a Request for Proposal (RFP) will be provided to selected

burden and costs.

Team members representing a cross section of the users of this service will 
provide requirements, evaluate vendor responses and communicate with their

While we hold these sessions on an annual basis to ensure our continued 
compliance with FERC's standards of conduct, the session will not simply be a 
repeat of last year's materials.  Each year we try to focus on new aspects of 
the rules.  This year our sessions will focus on:

? Maintaining our web site in compliance with the rules
? Handling e-mail requests and inquiries from marketing affiliates
? The implications of new electronic tools - EOL, eThink, etc.

In addition, we have prepared some fun video examples to illustrate day to 
day application of the rules.

The session will last only 1 hour from 8:30 - 9:30 AM in 5C2.  Last year you 
let me know that you expected refreshments - so I'm happy to report that 
donuts and coffee will be served.

All Houston-based marketing, finance and operations staff receiving this

Juvenile Diabetes Foundation (JDF) walk scheduled to take place on Sunday, 
November 5, 2000, at the Sam Houston Race Park.  I continue to serve on the 
board of JDF representing Enron and will be Enron's corporate executive for 
this year's fundraising efforts.

As many of you may already know, I am an insulin dependent diabetic myself.  
Even though I know how difficult this disease can be to manage with the 
multiple finger pricks for blood samples and several shots each day, I cannot 
imagine how difficult it is for a small child with this disease.  Taking 
insulin does not cure the disease nor prevent the development of 
complications; insulin is simply their life support system and without it 
they would die.

Enron continues to be a major corporate sponsor for JDF again this year.  JDF 
is a very efficient organization in which approximately 84% of all money 
raised goes directly to research.  Enron's goal this year is to raise 
$225,000 and we need your help.  Enron has been the number 1 walk team for 5 
years in a row and we are not ready to give up first place!  We need team 
leaders, walkers and volunteers to help us reach our goal.  The theme for the 
walk this year is ""Knock Out Diabetes"" and we would like to have you join us 
for this great event.  The Walk is truly a blast and we had about 500 Enron 
people participate last year and everyone enjoyed it.

If you are interested in volunteering to be a walker or a team leader, or if 
you would like to make a pledge, you may call any of the steering committee

     clearly are a little less than overjoyed. High gas prices are forcing 
some fertilizer producers to consider shutting down
     their plants and selling their feedstock on the open market just to make 
ends meet. 

     WEFA Inc. energy analyst Ron Denhardt estimates the gas industry will 
lose 25% (400 MMcf/d) of demand from the
     ammonia and urea industry this year because of the high price of natural 
gas. Other observers are expecting much larger
     losses, reaching as high as 1.5 Bcf/d. Denhardt also estimates the loss 
of an additional 1-2 Bcf/d due to fuel switching in
     the power production sector and possibly another 2.2 Bcf/d as industrial 
end users switch over to fuel oil. But those
     numbers are dependent on the comparative price of Nos. 1 and 2 fuel oil, 
both of which currently exceed the price of
     natural gas per Btu. 

     ""Chemical and fertilizer companies who have hedged their gas supplies 
are better off shutting down their plants right now
     and selling the gas into the market,"" said one chemical plant supply 
manager, who asked to remain anonymous. ""It's
     terrible. It's awful. About 70% of my contracts for sale are 
pass-through based on the cost of raw materials, and that's
     the only thing that is keeping me in business right now. We would not be 
making cost right now otherwise. We might be
     at a break-even point. And we hedged about 40% of our purchases back in 
September of last year, which was a pretty
     good time, looking back right now. We just have to plan it day by day. A 
number of fertilizer companies have closed
     up."" 

     It's difficult to say when it becomes uneconomic to produce fertilizer 
because each plant is unique with its specific
     depreciation rate and costs, noted Dennis Lee, manager of energy and 
feedstock for Sask Ferco Products Inc., a
     partnership of Cargil and the Saskatchewan government. Lee's plant is 
one of the largest ammonia and urea producers in
     the world. It uses about 75 MMcf/d. Regardless of the unique 
circumstances of each plant, however, it's clear most of
     the companies will have to put out a lot of cash in the next few months 
to stay producing, said Lee. ""From a credit
     perspective, some of the weaker companies may be in a credit crunch. 
There have been a couple of announcements of
     prolonged shut-downs in the Gulf Coast region recently because of high 
gas prices. 

     ""People are getting antsy"" because of a potential fertilizer shortage in 
the fall, he said. ""Overall, I don't think it's a very
     healthy time for our industry. There could be some restructuring because 
of it."" 

     He said it ""doesn't look like"" his plant is in any danger of a shut-down 
""at this point"" because it is very close to its
     customer base in the Midwest and has a high efficiency factor, much 
higher than its older competitors in the Gulf Coast
     and Midcontinent regions. But the outlook does not look as good for many 
of his competitors, he said. 

     Procter & Gamble recently turned to energy procurement over the Internet 
in an attempt achieve greater purchasing
     efficiency and lower prices. It is posting requests for quotes (RFQ) for 
a number of its facilities on a new transaction
     website, www.energygateway.com, as part of its exploration of new 
avenues for supply acquisition. ""We're in the early
     stages of experimenting with this,"" a P&G buyer said. (See Daily GPI, 
June 13) P&G, which like most very large energy
     using manufacturers, continues to do its buying and risk management 
in-house, plans to post more RFQs on the
     energygateway.com website. 

     ""We're looking for other opportunities to try out and evaluate. We're 
always looking for ways to bring value to our
     company,"" the P&G buyer said. ""It's not a good time to be a buyer in the 
energy market. We're re-evaluating our
     approaches. We don't want to just be a victim of the market."""

Armed with a ""smoking gun"" discovered in just-released data, the California 
Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) has launched a fresh offensive against El 
Paso Natural Gas' 1.22 Bcf/d transportation contract arrangement with 
affiliate El Paso Merchant Energy. 

Based on information uncovered in an internal e-mail, the CPUC now contends 
that the open season last February for one third of El Paso's firm 
transportation capacity was ""rigged"" to show preference to El Paso Merchant. 

The e-mail revealed that during the open season El Paso Merchant had 
""secretly negotiated"" a two cents/MMBtu transportation discount rate on 
Mojave Pipeline, another El Paso affiliate, for service from Topock to 
Southern California Gas at Wheeler Ridge for quantities above 100,000 MMBtu/d 
effective March 1, 2000, the CPUC told FERC. The interruptible discount would 
last the entire 15 months of the new contracts offered in El Paso Natural 
Gas' open season, state regulators said, adding that Mojave had withheld 
announcing the discount until Feb. 18 --- after El Paso's open season had 
ended. 

The discounted capacity on Mojave was critical, given that FERC previously 
had ruled that about half of the 1.22 Bcf/d El Paso capacity (Block II 
capacity) could not directly access the SoCal-Topock delivery point. As a way 
around this restriction, bidders in the El Paso open season knew they could 
use El Paso capacity to access Mojave Pipeline at Topock, and then have their 
gas shipped to SoCal at Wheeler Ridge, the CPUC said. But what they didn't 
know was that Mojave had negotiated a discount with El Paso Merchant, the 
commission noted. The shippers were operating under the assumption that the 
IT rate still was four cents/MMBtu, which it had been for the previous 18 
months. 

The information about the discount was disclosed in a Feb. 9 e-mail written 
by El Paso Merchant Vice President Robin Cox, which acknowledged that ""Mojave 
is willing to offer"" a two cent/MMBtu discount rate for volumes above 100,000 
MMBtu/d. ""I will not officially request this discount until next Wednesday 
assuming we win the capacity,"" the executive wrote. ""After it is posted, it 
will be [available] to everyone."" 

This e-mail makes ""clear that El Paso Merchant received preferential 
treatment from El Paso/Mojave and had unfair advantages over all other 
bidders during the open season"" in violation of Sections 4 and 5 of the 
Natural Gas Act, the CPUC charged. It urged FERC to ""fulfill its duty and 
abrogate"" the El Paso-El Paso Merchant contract arrangement."

services; however, they will be selling test gas in 
ramp up period.  Right now, these first deliveries are going into the ANR 
system because it is the only interconnect that is 
ready.

Alliance Delayed, But Deliveries Begin Ramping Up

After months of speculation in the industry, Alliance Pipeline confirmed 
yesterday full commercial service will be delayed nearly a month until Oct. 
30. When construction of the system was scheduled nearly three years ago, 
Oct. 2 was the target date for commercial service. 

However, the delay doesn't mean the market won't be getting any Canadian gas 
out of Alliance until the end of October. The pipeline opened one of its 
Chicago delivery valves last Thursday and started selling 50-100 MMcf/d of 
gas into the market. It intends to increase its sales each week eventually 
reaching its full 1.325 Bcf/d load prior to switching to commercial service 
on Oct. 30, said spokesman Jack Crawford. 

""We got Commission approval to actually sell our test gas. Right now I think 
we are dealing with three or four different marketers. Our initial deliveries 
right now are into the ANR system. That's because its basically the only 
connection that is ready, but over the next few weeks we expect they will all 
be ready to go and we will test them all. 

""I'd be surprised if it ends up being regular [volume increases of 100 MMcf/d 
each week] but that's kind of the game plan,"" said Crawford. ""On Oct. 29 it 
will be Alliance selling [1.325 Bcf/d of] test gas, and on Oct. 30 it will be 
shippers nominating at one end and delivering at the other. The market may 
not see much of a difference. We obviously don't want to start charging our 
shippers until we have the confidence that all the systems have been checked 
out."" 

The pipeline system is designed to deliver gas from producing regions of 
northeastern British Columbia and northwestern Alberta to the Chicago area 
where the line interconnects with the North American pipeline grid. 
Currently, more than 99% of the total pipeline system has been installed, 
including 14 mainline compressor stations, 37 receipt points in British 
Columbia and Alberta, and 7 delivery points in Illinois. Commissioning 
activities commenced in March, including the flowing of gas into the 
completed sections of line to purge air from the pipe. At present, 
approximately 95% of Alliance has been purged of air. This includes all the 
mainline portion of the system (1,857 miles) from near Gordondale, Alberta to 
the delivery section near Joliet, Illinois and 306 of 434 mile laterals 
receipt portion of the system. Additionally, 25 receipt point meter stations 
have been commissioned. Final commissioning activities are also being 
completed at 14 mainline compressor stations. To date, 6 Bcf of gas is in the 
commissioned mainline and lateral portions of the system, with the ultimate 
line pack targeted at 8 Bcf. 

Crawford said there were a variety of factors that contributed to the delayed 
start-up. ""The rain in Saskatchewan delayed us a bit back in July, but we 
managed to catch up on the construction there in August. But it then meant 
that some of our commissioning didn't get going until a little bit later. 
Farther west in Alberta and BC in fact we've had a couple of rain problems. 
In particular, we have one relatively small but fairly long lateral that we 
haven't even been able to get on the right of way yet and that's because of 
rain. 

""Up in BC we've been having trouble with a directional drill of a creek on 
one of our laterals up there,"" he said. ""We're likely to get approval to 
open-cut that creek, but that will take us probably the better part of a 
month. 

""On the downstream end, we had hoped to get more of our downstream 
connections right now. We are testing one, but some of the others aren't 
quite ready yet. We're ready, but they are not. Then of course there is a 
fairly complex interaction between the pipeline and the [Aux Sable liquids] 
plant. We haven't had a chance to work on that yet. So when you look at all 
of those things, the question was when could we establish a date when all 
this stuff would be done and we would be operational. We spent a fair amount 
of time with our shippers and they mentioned one other pipeline that was 
being delayed one day at a time drove them to distraction. We agreed we would 
pick one of three dates, all Mondays: Oct. 2, Oct. 16 or Oct. 30, and we just 
had to pick one that we felt confident in."" 

Besides the timing of service, there has been another important question on 
the minds of many market observers. Will the gas Alliance ships come Oct. 30 
be incremental gas or gas that would have been flowing through TransCanada. 

""I don't think it's going to be purely either way,"" said Crawford. ""Lots of 
guys are targeting for Nov. 1 to bring their new gas on to start the gas year 
so it all depends on how much shows up. It's not a big secret that we've had 
some wet weather and some of the drilling and completion work hasn't gotten 
done. That's likely to have some affect on it as well. That's a delay though. 
How long are people going to pay $6 for gas? Boy, people are going to have a 
lot of money for drilling and projects."""

limited to acquire this off-system capacity to the Apr-Oct period and we must 
file a report with the Commission at the end of the 2 year period detailing 
what impact, if any, this proposal has had on the market.

El Paso Blanco Mis-Measurement - El Paso pipeline called this week and agreed 
with TW that they had been erroneously calibrating their Blanco meter for the 
last several years and did in fact owe TW gas volume.  They would like to 
offset the balance owed TW against volume NNG owes El Paso.  Market Services 
is verifying the net volume figures.  The settlement volume proposed by El 
Paso is 91% of everything we requested.  We will attempt to take the 
approximately 651,000 MMBtu back at Window Rock over a 30 day period 
beginning in October.

Arizona Public Service - We have re-negotiated their FT agreement prior to 
the ROFR being triggered at the end of September.  APS will renew its 8,000 
MMBtu/d Permian to Needles agreement at the max rate for one year as well as 
the provision if they release the capacity at greater than max rate, TW and 
APS will share the upside 50/50.

Red Cedar Gathering - We received the signed letter agreement from Red Cedar 
which commits them to full reimbursement of the capital expense necessary to 
increase the Arkansas Loop meter from 200,000 MMBtu to 300,000 MMBtu/d.  We 
expect this meter increase to be completed and flowing in excess of the 
current 200,000 MMBtu/d by January 1, 2001.

System Expansions - We have updated our cost estimates and RAROC for 
expansions of the I-B Link, Blanco to Thoreau and mainline segments of the 
pipe.  We will follow up with PNM today on cost comparisons.  The TW 
expansion appears to be more cost effective than PNM's. 

The BP Amoco/Vastar merger is set for completion today.  Amoco will begin 
marketing Vastar's equity gas beginning 11/1/00.  Amoco has expressed a high 
level of interest on the remaining capacity from Ignacio to Blanco and from 
Red Cedar to Blanco for 2001.  They will provide a firm offer to TW next week.

Line Outages:
The September 13th allocation due to compressor failure in TW's West of 
Thoreau Area allowed for 42,0000 MMBtu of IT volumes to flow from PG&E Topock 
to Socal Needles.  Revenue generated at max rate equaled $10,500 to partially 
offset the commodity and fuel loss.

EOG Resources - EOG executed the Interconnect and Operating agreement for the 
15,000 MMBtu/d we expect from their new well.  Transwestern has initiated 
landowner notifications which  takes at least 30 days.  We continue to 
negotiate with EOG on becoming a new shipper and taking firm transport on TW. 

Burlington Resources Val Verde Plant - TW's ability to accept the contracted 
volume from the plant on a consistent basis continues to be an issue.  High 
temperatures and volume flow in the San Juan region have reduced our 
capacity.  BR is requesting relief to offset the monetary impact of gas that 
was shut in or sold at lesser margins in other locations.  We are working 
with Facility Planning to determine what capital / equipment may be necessary 
to meet our contractual demand."

El Paso Energy and Coastal Corp. announced plans yesterday to relocate more 
than 1,200 employees and retain only satellite offices at the El Paso Natural 
Gas headquarters in El Paso, TX, and the ANR Pipeline headquarters in 
Detroit, MI, once their merger is approved by the FTC, which is expected 
sometime in the fourth quarter. No final decision on staff reductions has 
been made, an El Paso spokeswoman said. 

The companies intend consolidate the operations of their five pipeline 
systems into three organizations, collectively led by John W. Somerhalder II. 
Under the consolidation plan, the combined company's nationwide pipeline 
system will be consolidated into three regional operations. The western 
region will consist of El Paso Natural Gas Company and Colorado Interstate 
Gas Company and will be headquartered in Colorado Springs, CO. The eastern 
region will consist of ANR Pipeline and Tennessee Gas Pipeline and will be 
headquartered in Houston. Southern Natural will make up the southeastern 
region headquartered in Birmingham, AL. 

John Somerhalder will continue as the executive vice president of the El Paso 
Pipeline Group. Patricia A. Shelton, currently president of El Paso Natural 
Gas, will lead the consolidated western region pipelines. Jay Holm, currently 
responsible for El Paso's Australian pipeline assets, will return to the 
United States to become CEO of the eastern region. Reporting to Holm as 
presidents of Tennessee and ANR will be Stephen C. Beasley and James J. 
Cleary, respectively. The southeastern region will be led by James C. 
Yardley, who will continue as president of Southern. Shelton, Holm, and James 
Yardley will report to Somerhalder. 

""This consolidation will create the most effective organization for El Paso's 
pipeline system,"" said El Paso CEO William A. Wise. ""Our upcoming merger with 
Coastal will create an interstate transmission system that spans the nation, 
border to border and coast to coast. This consolidation represents a highly 
disciplined approach to managing this system, allowing us to strike a proper 
balance between customer focus and operational efficiency. It also 
facilitates a company-to-company exchange of expertise across our system and 
speeds the merging of separate company cultures."" 

While the companies will be organizationally merged, the five pipeline 
systems will remain separate with separate tariffs and separate names. Though 
many back office functions such as accounting and gas control will be 
consolidated and relocated to the new headquarters, field functions and 
related activities will remain in their current locations. In addition, some 
employees will remain in the El Paso and Detroit locations. The company will 
ask affected employees whether they want to be considered for relocation. 
Those employees who elect not to relocate will be given severance packages. 
Most moves will occur during the first half of next year, and the majority of 
the plan is expected to be implemented by mid-2001. 

The companies announced their $16 billion polling-of-interests transaction in 
January (see Daily GPI, Jan. 19). The merger is expected to be accretive to 
El Paso's earnings per share (EPS) immediately and add more than 5% to EPS in 
both 2001 and 2002, Wise said at the time of the merger announcement. 
Overall, the two companies expect $200 million in cost savings. By 
comparison, the El Paso-Sonat merger created more than $100 million in 
savings and more than 600 people lost their jobs. 

The combined interstate transmission system of the new company will consist 
of over 58,000 miles of pipeline, by far the most of any pipeline company in 
North America. The system will transport more than 20 Bcf/d of gas through 
existing pipeline infrastructure, but will have sole or part ownership in 
three other new or proposed major pipelines, including Alliance, Gulfstream 
and Independence. The company also will be the second largest gatherer of 
natural gas in the United States and the third largest U.S. producer of gas."

Pursuant to our conversation today, we will implement the following change in 
the way Market Services allocates the California delivery points:

Historically we have allocated the border as an area.  Effective 9/18/00 
until further notice, we will allocate the border by individual points.

If SoCal windows TW down to a number less than the standard 750,000 MMBtu/d, 
then we will allocate shipper noms down to the window total.
PGE and Mojave points will be individually allocated to their capacities as 
well.

If the opportunity arises whereby gas allocated at Needles can be moved to 
Topock or Mojave, then Market Services should work with the Shippers to 
accommodate their needs.

The West of Thoreau area should not exceed the 1,090,000 MMBtu/d capacity 
constraint.

Any questions can be directed to Steve January, TK Lohman, or Darrell 
Schoolcraft."

Next week, we are going to begin Phase I of the Windows 2000/Outlook 
Project.  In this phase, we will be gathering information about the hardware 
and software that you are using within your group.  

The process will begin with an email inventory.  You will receive an email on 
Monday, September 25, with the subject of W2K Inventory-Please Open.  All you 
need to do is open the email message.  This email will do a quick inventory 
of applications you have installed on your PC or that you may access from the 
network, as well as your desktop hardware specifications.  The information 
gathered from this email will be stored in a Notes database for reporting.  
It is very important that you open this email from your primary workstation.  
Please do not open it remotely, or if you're checking someone else's mail.

Mid-week, we will deploy teams to conduct individual interviews to assure 
that we have a complete picture of your technical environment.  This process 
will take approximately six weeks to complete for all of ETS.  The findings 
from these interviews will determine the Phase II start date.

Data Responsibility

As we prepare for this massive effort, we ask that you assist us by doing the 
following:
1) identify any business-related applications that may reside locally.
2) remove data from the local drive of your desktop (c:\ and/or d:\), and 
store it on your network drive.  The special data requirements of laptop  
users will be addressed during the actual migration.
3) remove all non-business-related data from network drives.
4) remove non-company-owned applications from your environment.
5) if you have historical data that does not change, contact the Solution 
Center and have a CD created for a more permanent storage method.


Training for Windows 2000/Outlook

Training requirements will be addressed during Phase II by a number of 
methods that will include:
hands-on training, which will consist of 1 hour on Windows 2000 and 2 hours 
on Outlook,
IPTV video,
tri-fold cards on the Microsoft products, and
CBT (Computer-Based Training).

Just so you'll know: ""The natural gas market is a real success story. ...FERC 
has gotten an enormous amount of things right. The market may not be 
unblemished, but there are lots who consider the natural gas market the best 
market in the world offering genuine price discovery on a daily basis across 
dozens of products. It's something everyone should be proud of,"" Robert Levin 
of the New York Mercantile Exchange told a FERC conference yesterday. 

""The natural gas market has performed remarkably admirably through a range of 
market conditions with hundreds, if not thousands of market participants, 
using an extraordinary selection of market instruments,"" Levin continued, 
adding that the Commission should be supporting the ""growth and increased 
sophistication of commerce. You're at that point now."" 

Warning against so-called solutions offered by some at the day-long 
conference to increase liquidity or tie the natural gas market to the 
electric market, Levin cautioned, ""liquidity cannot be legislated. Don't 
overreact. The electric market is poorly regulated. Remedies from the natural 
gas market should be transferred to the electric market, rather than allow 
the gas market to be corrupted by the regulatory mistakes of the electric 
market. 

""Rather than worry over regulating an hourly market for natural gas, change 
the electric market,"" which Levin believes has developed its over-emphasis on 
the hourly market because of the artificial tilt toward the spot market. 

But while Levin warned against too much market meddling, others among the 
more than 30 representatives of the industry and its customers testifying at 
FERC's conference on competitive natural gas markets argued for a variety of 
initiatives to increase market liquidity by changing the rules for pipeline 
transportation. 

Eliminating the shipper-must-have-title rule, promoting expansion of the 
existing pipeline infrastructure (especially in the Northeast), doing away 
with straight-fix-variable (SFV) rate design, review of firm-to-wellhead 
rates in the production region and the allocation of transportation costs 
between the upstream and downstream were among the chief proposals proffered 
by mostly pipeline customers. 

However, greater gas market liquidity shouldn't be confused with increased 
competition in pipeline transportation, municipals and producers told FERC 
staff during a post-Order 637 technical conference Wednesday. ""...[W]e're 
concerned the Commission may be equating market liquidity with competition in 
pipeline transportation. The two are not the same,"" said Arthur Corbin on 
behalf of the American Public Gas Association (APGA), which represents 
municipal gas distributors. 

""Even with greater and greater market liquidity, monopoly power exists in 
[the] pipeline transportation segment. Captive shippers will always require a 
regulated transportation service from any hub to their citygate,"" he said. 

Much the same holds true for LDCs, noted Bruce Henning, director of energy 
practices for Energy and Environmental Analysis Inc. (EEA), who represented 
the American Gas Association (AGA) at the Commission staff conference. He 
agreed market liquidity has improved immeasurably, but he added ""there's not 
a liquid market center at every pipeline receipt or delivery point location. 
Nor is there likely to be market centers in all of these locations in the 
near future..."" Consequently, Henning said FERC will need to continue to 
protect producers from market power that accompanies ""limited access"" to 
pipelines. 

The day-long conference held yesterday in Washington D.C. was the first of 
several that FERC staff plans to hold to explore the impact of the 
Commission's transportation policies on the development of gas markets. 

Christopher A. Helms, president and COO of Panhandle Pipeline Companies, 
urged FERC not to enact policy changes that would place commodity market 
liquidity as the ""ultimate goal"" at the expense of the transportation market. 
Helms said he advocated policies encouraging pipeline expansions and 
construction of ""optimal amounts of additional capacity"" to meet the needs of 
the market. ""The single most important characteristic for liquidity in the 
natural gas commodity markets is the availability of adequate transportation 
capacity."" 

Charles Daverio, vice president of KeySpan Corp., echoed that sentiment, 
saying FERC could increase liquidity in the New York City market and 
elsewhere in the Northeast by promoting construction of new pipeline capacity 
to ensure adequate supplies for the region year-round. This would reduce 
energy costs and enhance reliability, he noted. 

Panhandle's Helms also cautioned against policy changes that would force the 
development of new market centers and hubs. Market centers should be allowed 
to develop at their ""own pace,"" and at locations where the market ""sees fit,"" 
he said. 

EEA's Henning estimated more than 40 ""liquid and transparent"" market centers 
exist today, which permit industry participants to buy and sell gas daily 
under ""extremely competitive"" conditions. He said he's ""confident"" more will 
be added because of the options that they provide to gas customers. As 
another way to enhance liquidity, KeySpan's Daverio --- as well as others --- 
supported eliminating the shipper-must-have-title rule, which requires the 
customer to retain title to the gas while it's being shipped. Doing away with 
the rule would pave the way for the development of new pipeline products and 
services, such as operational balancing and virtual storage, he told the FERC 
staff. 

But Dena Wiggins, an attorney with the D.C. law firm of Sutherland, Asbill & 
Brennan LLP, which represents the Process Gas Consumers Group (industrial gas 
customers), said her group was ""very concerned"" about efforts to repeal the 
rule. ""...I haven't heard anything yet [today] that satisfies the concerns 
that we might have."" She noted the Commission already has granted exceptions 
to the shipper-must-have-title rule in certain cases, and should continue 
with this policy where necessary. 

Moreover, Wiggins said industrial customers were increasingly worried about 
the mounting market power of unregulated companies, especially gas marketers. 

At the conference, she also expressed her group's dismay with the pipeline 
compliance filings with Order 637, particularly on the penalty issue. Rather 
than an ""improved"" penalty structure, pipelines are proposing higher 
penalties, Wiggins said. ""[We] continue to be shocked at the absolute 
wholesale departures"" from 637. 

BP's Jeff Holligan also waded into the fight against all the new services 
outlined by pipelines in their Order 637 filings, which he said were ""nothing 
more than penalties disguised as balancing services that customers can't 
refuse."" He urged the Commission to check with a pipeline's customers, noting 
one proposed new ""service"" is opposed by 100% of the pipeline's 
non-affiliated customers. Some of the proposed services, Holligan said, add 
up to nothing more than degradation of existing long-term firm service. 

Holligan, representing the largest producer in the U.S. and Canada, joined 
other market participants in urging adoption of ""standardized allocation 
(sales), standardized penalty levels, and the requirement that all pipelines 
implement a uniform title transfer tracking process."" In short, 
""standardizing pipeline services, certainly on an individual pipeline, and 
also to a large extent between and across pipelines is imperative if markets 
are to be highly liquid..Individually negotiated services, where every 
service is a different service, or the adoption of a so-called dual track 
market, are the antithesis of a highly liquid, efficient and competitive gas 
market. Standardization of operational terms of pipeline service is necessary 
to facilitate trading through e-commerce."" 

""The Commission should be striving to commoditize pipeline capacity so it can 
be traded along with gas electronically,"" Holligan said."

to the Growing Energy Crisis"" are quoted in this article.

Industry Fears Consumer Backlash Because of High Prices 

The natural gas industry should be prepared to face customer revolts and 
attempts at price caps, similar to those witnessed this summer in San Diego 
if it's a cold winter and prices continue to hit new highs. That was the 
warning from government and industry representatives at the crisis conference 
held by the Interstate Oil & Gas Compact Commission (IOGCC) yesterday. 

Representatives of producing states and industry speakers were unanimous in 
opposing government intervention to restrain prices, but no one had a ready 
remedy for consumer reaction if they are hit with a double whammy of greater 
energy use at higher prices this winter. One speaker offered a bright spot: 
the industry might emerge relatively unscathed if the winter is moderate. But 
then he added it's not just residential heating bills, but electric bills as 
well that will be impacted by higher natural gas prices. Others pointed out 
that demand and higher prices could spur lawmakers to open more areas to 
drilling and encourage new long lines. 

""Industrial customers have been dealing with high prices for some time, but 
higher bills for residential and small commercial customers are just starting 
to hit the radar screen,"" Peggy Claytor, purchasing manager for steel-maker 
The Timken Co., told the group of more than 300 from the U.S., Canada and 
Mexico, meeting in Columbus, OH. ""We may see protests or proposals or calls 
for price caps this winter."" She said she is opposed to caps because they 
fail to solve the underlying problems, and she blamed the ""dysfunctional 
electricity grid"" in part for aggravating the run-up in natural gas prices. 

Asked whether he expected to see a public outcry from residentials this 
winter, Stephen L. Baum, chairman of Sempra Energy, whose San Diego Gas & 
Electric subsidiary has borne the brunt of the California debacle (and whose 
prices were capped), had a one word answer: ""Absolutely."" 

Enron Chairman Ken Lay agreed. ""If we have a combination of a cold winter 
with high prices, it could send bills up quite substantially. Certainly, 
there could be some reaction."" Lay said he expected prices to be high for the 
short to medium term, coming down over next two to three years. ""As long as 
regulators leave it alone, this market will come back into balance."" Lay 
pointed out that even if prices to consumers hit $8.20/Mcf this winter, it 
would be just equal to the price level, adjusted for inflation, in 1986. 

Even at today's prices, ""energy is the best buy there is,"" Robert Allison, 
Jr., chairman of Anadarko Petroleum, told the group, pointing out how 
consumer prices for other basics such as houses and cars, have increased over 
the past 15 years. The problem with energy prices is they have stayed low for 
so long. 

If the government wants to take action, it should open more public lands to 
drilling, Allison said, estimating there are 213 Tcf of reserves--- or a 
10-year supply --- that are off limits in the lower 48 states. Only portions 
of the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska are effectively open for drilling. ""It's up 
to Congress to provide greater access,"" Allison said. 

Others, including Alaska Gov. Tony Knowles, said government should encourage 
the building of additional pipeline capacity, particularly a new pipeline 
from Alaska. 

Leading off the ""Governors' Natural Gas Summit: Responding to the Growing 
Energy Crisis,"" Daniel Yergin, chairman of Cambridge Energy Research 
Associates, called the current situation a ""shock,"" not a ""crisis."" A lack of 
reserves would be a crisis, but there are plenty of reserves. It's simply 
that demand has accelerated and bumped up against the ""iron law of lead 
times."" He said the industry would have to invest more than $500 billion over 
the next ten years, nearly double the level of the 1990s, to keep up with new 
markets. 

Yergin called for the U.S. to coordinate supply development policy with 
Mexico and Canada. ""This is not just a U.S. issue. And there will not be just 
U.S. solutions --- there must be a continent-wide response."" 

In the meantime, the industry should attempt to cushion the short-term shock 
through consumer education, conservation and low income assistance programs."

?
??? The Climate Prediction Center,  a unit of the National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration, discusses the  outlook for this winter. The 
agency does not expect El Nino and La Nina to  affect global weather for the 
next nine months. The two weather patterns, which  occur because of changes 
in ocean temperatures in the Pacific Ocean, directly  influence US rain 
patterns and land temperatures. The CPC says this winter will  be the first 
year in three that the US has not had a strong influence from this  
particular climate-driving force. But, that does not mean there will be a 
whole  lot of difference in terms of when winter will start. It will have 
something to  do with temperatures, because both La Nina and El Nino have 
tended to make  temperatures moderate in the winter.? The CPC expects that 
this winter  nationwide on average will still be slightly warmer than normal, 
but not as warm  as the last three. The northern part of the nation and 
particularly the  Northeast, however, could be an exception with colder 
weather. The warmer  pattern will be confined more to the West and the South. 
East of the Mississippi  with the exception of Florida should be cooler this 
winter and most of  California and the northern half of the Rockies and the 
Dakotas. For the fall  and winter, expect the Southwest to be the mild and 
dry."

You may have recently received communication from United HealthCare (UHC) 
concerning Memorial Hermann Health Systems' (MHHS) decision to terminate 
their contract with UHC  in the Houston/Beaumont area.  This communication 
also included the names of physicians who will be dropped from the network 
due to this action.  It is our intent to help you understand the situation.

It is our understanding that Memorial Herman Health Systems asked for a 40% 
increase in fees - a substantial increase that would have been passed on to 
you and Enron!  When United HealthCare attempted to negotiate with a counter 
proposal, Memorial Hermann cancelled their contract.

While this contractual arrangement was between the hospital system and UHC, 
Enron continues to support UHC in their ongoing contract negotiation 
efforts.  At this time, it is only UHC which has been affected, however, it 
is our understanding that Cigna has also been contacted by the hospital group 
and may be in contract negotiations at this time as well.  

Many doctors have obtained admission privileges to other area hospitals 
within the UHC Network or have contracted directly with UHC including those 
with admission privileges to The Woodlands, Sugarland and Clear Lake 
Hospitals, to name a few.  In a further effort to limit disruption to our 
affected employees and families who are enrolled in the UHC Network or EPO 
options, Enron has authorized UHC to process claims incurred between 
September 28 and December 31, 2000 as if the termination of the Memorial 
Hermann Health Systems from the network had not occurred and In-Network 
benefits applied.  Office visits will have a $10 copayment and all other 
charges will be covered at 90%.  Hospital admissions will still need to be 
pre-certified with UHC.

These steps have decreased the number of participants' affected by Primary 
Care Physician disruption from 1,050 to 127.

If You Need Medical Attention:  You or your doctor/hospital must call UHC's 
customer service number so proper benefits can be verified.  In some cases 
the hospital or doctor may request payment at the time service is performed.  
If this should happen, please obtain an itemized statement and submit it to 
UHC with a claim form for prompt reimbursement.  Claim forms can be obtained 
by calling 1-800-332-7979 or in Houston at 713-853-7979 ( press 1).

Open enrollment materials will be coming soon.  Take this opportunity to 
consider your elections for 2001.  

United HealthCare and Enron HR are committed to assisting Enron employees 
through this transition.  We will communicate any  further developments that 
may impact you or your family."

To prepare for El Paso Energy's looming takeover of Coastal Corp., Westcoast 
Energy Inc. and Coastal are splitting up Engage Energy, their three-year-old 
marketing venture, with each retaining a half interest in the Houston-based 
gas marketer. The split should be completed by the end of the week. 

Coastal, headquartered in Houston, will merge with El Paso Energy in a $16 
billion deal by the end of the fourth quarter (see Daily GPI, Jan. 19), and 
company officials said that several transactions needed to be completed 
before the merger could be finalized, including dismantling the Engage 
venture. Vancouver-based Westcoast and Coastal each own 50% interest in 
Engage, which has 12 regional offices throughout North America and employs 
300. One of the top North American gas marketers, it purchases natural gas 
from every producing basin in North America, and trades electricity within 
all NERC regions. Engage estimates it will add another 1 Bcf/d to its natural 
gas deliverability by the end of this year. 

NGI ranked Engage in 12th place in its 1999 North American power marketers 
list, dropping from eighth place in 1998, losing about 15.2% in sales. Engage 
reported a sales volume of 5.6 Bcf/d last year, compared with 6.6 Bcf/d the 
previous year. It sold an estimated 2,100 Bcf of natural gas in 1999. 

Westcoast and Coastal formed Engage in 1997 to offer a full spectrum of 
energy services, including natural gas marketing and trading, electricity 
trading and sales, energy management services, structured storage and 
transportation-related services, structured power and management services and 
energy risk management services. The companies said that those services would 
continue as before. There is expected to be little impact on either company's 
existing asset valuation. 

Under the restructuring plan, Westcoast will retain the Engage Canadian 
business entity and certain natural gas and power activities in the United 
States. Westcoast also will retain the right to use the Engage Energy name 
and will continue to conduct business from Calgary, Southfield, MI and other 
U.S. locations. Coastal will retain the U.S. business entity, with 
headquarters in Houston. 

""By taking full ownership of our natural gas and electricity marketing and 
trading functions, we can better capitalize on the knowledge, experience, 
track record and infrastructure that we have built over the past three 
years,"" said Michael Phelps, Westcoast CEO. 

When Coastal merges with El Paso, it will be joining a company that already 
has a strong gas marketing arm. NGI ranked El Paso seventh on its list of gas 
marketers in 1999, noting that it traded 6.7 Bcf/d of natural gas last year. 
It also was ranked seventh in 1998."

TW Fuel Performance Measurement Model (FPM)
Working with the SCADA support group to identify the equivalent SCADA points 
to existing MIPS Points, for conversion of the model to a real-time basis. An 
initial query revealed that only ~50% of MIPS points have a SCADA 
equivalent.  Priority will be given to identification/addition of points on 
the San Juan Lateral and the Thoreau Junction to Needles.  

Developing an estimate of the time required to complete the conversion of the 
FPM Model to a real-time basis.

TW Fuel Performance Measurement for Fuel Overage Forecasting
The Revenue/Risk Management group are analyzing the existing FPM model 
groupings to evaluate the use of our model in combination with their demand 
model.  The combined model would provide fuel burned on forecasted demand.   
Initial analysis looks promising and they hope to give us an answer by next 
week whether the FPM model can be used as is. 

Beaver to Mullinville B-C Sweeping 
 Pipeline operating conditions have been analyzed since the sweep was 
completed on 09/21/00.  Recent sweeps had improved flow efficiency only about 
5%.  Last week's sweep improved the efficiency by 35% to about 85%.  Pressure 
drops decreased from 125 PSI down to about 40 PSI.  Mullinville has operated 
with one less 2000 HP unit while Beaver units are operating with less load 
while producing lower suctions.

Outage Modeling
Ran hydraulic models for Gas Control to determine flows with Bisti down and 
with Unit 303 down.

San Juan Efficiency Study
Developed multiple scenarios for San Juan flows and pressures if the line was 
to be cleaned.  Basic economic analysis was also performed.

Hydraulic Model for EOTT
The current EOTT hydraulic model has been revised to include the dependence 
of the fluid properties on temperature and pressure as well the appropriate 
heat transfer considerations.


Houston Facility Planning Team    (Team Leader: Perry Frazier 713/853-0667)

TW Expansion Studies 
Looked at different combinations of pipe loop and compression trying to 
reduce overall costs.  No luck so far.  A brainstorming session is scheduled 
next week to see if there are any different approaches not considered to date.
El Paso Field Services
Compiling information for inclusion into the Interconnect and Operating 
Agreement between EPFS and Enron.  Mostly locations, materials and POI 
number, expect to have all information gathered by the end of the week.

San Juan Lateral
Enron Operations Services has visited 3 laboratories in the area and compiled 
information on their analysis procedures.  They want Facility Planning to 
help evaluate and choose one for the sample evaluation.  Results will take 
about 2 weeks.  Also, received some expected flow/pressure enhancements for 
the last 30 - 40 miles of the SJ Lateral, using the expected efficiencies 
calculated for a pressure profile taken after the 1998 chemical cleaning 
run.   Results will be reported next week. 

Liberal Operations - PRIDE Meeting
Attended operations meeting in Liberal that covered various areas of 
operations and ways to improve.  Facility Planning did a presentation on the 
proposed Emergency Response Program and provided general information on 
Facility Planning services that can assist Operations.

Prospective Market Zone Wichita, Kansas
Commercial requested market study of competitor pipelines serving the 
Wichita, Kansas area (Duke, KPL, Williams), research possible load 
requirements, and facility requirements to connect the area to NNG's pipeline 
system.  Wichita is located about 90 miles from the Macksville compressor 
station as a crow flies.
Outage Coordination 
 Provided the study to determine flows on the San Juan lateral and mainline 
when Bisti outage occurs in October.  Both San Juan and the mainline will 
have reduced flows.  Study results were given to Market Services. Also 
provided support for System Optimization to determine the flows west when 
Station #3 unit 3 is out of service.

Marketing Strategy Meeting 
Attended and participated in the Marketing Strategy meeting.  Main assignment 
for Planning is to continue looking for revenue generating projects.

E&C
Participated in a review of the responding candidates for the vacant Project 
Engineering position.



Omaha Facility Planning Team     (Team Leader: Steve Thomas 402-398-7468)

Earlville Outage
On October 12th starting at 8:00 am the Earlville unit will be taken down for 
relocation of the blow down silencer.   Solar will also be on site to do some 
bleed air manifold baffle modifications.  After this work is completed, the 
District will perform a water wash in preparation for emissions testing on 
October 16th & 17th.  The unit should be back on-line sometime near midnight 
on October 12th.

With Earlville down for this time frame the flow on the East leg will be 
limited to the 660-680 mmcf/d range.  We anticipate that normal nominations 
will be below this threshold, and that by packing the system the night before 
we will be able to make it through without any impact.   Gas Control is 
putting this outage on the EBB.  From a Marketing perspective we should limit 
short term sustainables, but Ops did not want to call an allocation day.  If 
we did, the allocation would be 86% of firm in Zone D for all deliveries.  

The emissions testing on October 16th & 17th will have very little impact on 
system flows.

Planning White Paper
Planning met with various Marketing representatives to try and attach a value 
to the four ideas put forth in the White Paper.   The ideas were thoroughly 
discussed and the input we received will be incorporated into the Paper.   
One suggestion was that we use the Pricing Desk to determine the value of the 
additional capacity.  We will be meeting with them to do that.  Meanwhile 
research continues on the various costs associated with the White Paper, 
specifically sites for proposed inlet pressure additions.  

Engineering Records Research
EOG - Texas Co. #4 (C.000269.01):  
This is an interconnect where the Texas Co. #4 8"" Lateral (OKG-19301) 
connected to the 24"" OKM-12001.  An incorrect line number on the project 
authorization located the project six miles upstream of the actual site.  
Engineering Records did not have the one page amendment with the project 
authorization to explain who owns and operates the facilities.  Texas Co. #4 
facilities had been removed.  The remaining pipe downstream of the compressor 
site to OKM-12001 (approximately 4.5 miles) has been transferred to EOG 
Resources as of June 16, 2000.  (Project Authorization C.000369.02/Removal).

Ogden H2S Monitor (SN0157):  
Verification of materials used in the construction of the monitor was 
needed.  Operations confirmed that a Farm Tap Assembly was used to create the 
monitoring facilities, not to install a farm tap within the Ogden Plant yard. 
 
Cedar Falls #2
Marketing needed to know if there was any money left in the work order to 
purchase a new regulator, since the interruptible peaking turbine load is 
causing problems with the existing regulator.  Property Accounting reported 
the amount remaining, but it will not be enough for a new regulator.

St. Croix Valley
Provided options for the proposed ten year expansion for St. Croix Valley.  
Examined cost versus incremental growth on the Black River Falls Branchline.  
Provided an analysis for option of integrating the growth with the Wisconsin 
Gas proposal.  Following the latest strategic marketing meeting, will examine 
compression alternatives for St. Criox Valley as a stand-alone project.

Grimes #1 TBS - Pressure Increase
Working with Marketing and the Field.  Examined several options regarding the 
customer,s request for a pressure increase to a delivery of 150 psig.  
Marketing will examine all the options in order to determine best strategic 
fit for the customer.

Ogden Building #2 Discharge Pressure
Research has been completed in trying to locate documentation that supports 
the 1000 psig MAOP for the building #2 discharge header.  The supporting 
documentation has been forwarded to Lisa Choquette in Codes for approval.  If 
documentation is approved as supporting evidence for the 1000 psig MAOP then 
only minor controls work will be required in the field in order to increase 
the discharge pressure of the building #2 engines.  

Pengilly TBS - Mesabi System
Marketing was presented with two separate estimates for modification required 
to increase firm at Pengilly from 12 mcf/day to 210 mcf/day.   The first 
estimate for $85,000 consisted mostly of contract labor with field personnel 
only installing the EFM.  The team responded with a proposal that they would 
be willing to do all of the labor if it could be scheduled during Jan-March.  
A second estimate of $66,000 was submitted to Marketing, which included all 
district labor.  This estimate is contingent on completing the deal prior to 
Dec 31,2000.  If a deal is made after Dec 31, 2000 then the higher cost 
estimate applies.

Monroe #1 TBS Mods / Pressure Increase
The Monroe #1 TBS Mods Project was released to Engineering.   The project was 
the result of WIGas raising the IT load by approximately 4000 mcf/day.  They 
also requested a pressure increase at the station from 80 psig to 275 
psig.    A Form 2476 ""Pressure Increase Request Form"" is being circulated for 
signature.  The project has a targeted Nov 30, 2000 in-service date.  The 
modifications consist of replacing both meters with spool pieces and 
performing a pressure test to upgrade the MAOP.

Milbank Project
Continued gathering data to model the Milbank system as it is today.

Melbourne #1 - Project Release
The Melbourne #1 TBS Mods project was released to Engineering.   The project 
consists of TBS mods to support the increase of firm from 330 mcf/day to 500 
mcf/day at Melbourne. Presently the Marshalltown B/L is constrained and could 
not support the incremental firm.  Alliant will realign gas away from the 
Marshalltown #1 TBS which is at the end of this B/L to the Marshalltown #1A 
TBS which is on a different B/L.  This will open up capacity on the line for 
this new load.   The project has a targeted Nov 30, 2000 in-service date.  
Modifications consist of replacing the first and second cut regulators and 
replacing the meter.

Adel #1A TBS Mods - project release
The Adel #1A TBS Mods Project was released to engineering.  This project was 
a result of the customer wanting to convert an existing IT load at Adel #1A 
to a Firm load.  The new Firm load will be 1400 mcf/day.   The project has a 
targeted Nov 30, 2000 in-service date.  The station will have a new meter 
installed along with piping size modifications.

Ethanol Injection
Reviewed and researched (for Marketing) the possibility of injecting Ethanol 
into the pipeline for a possible ""Green Energy"" rating and as a means of BTU 
enhancement.  Since ethanol would remain a liquid at any normal pipeline 
conditions, even atomizing the ethanol at the point of injection would not 
insure the Ethanol from liquefying, dropping out and collecting into the 
pipeline low spots.  Also, there were many issues concerning possible liquids 
entering the fuel systems of our equipment and other customers, equipment.  
Planning recommended that this project not be pursued.

Researched (for Marketing) was the possibility of burning a Methane/Ethanol 
mix in our equipment (i.e.: Turbines) in order to receive a ""Green Power"" 
rating.  Solar was contacted concerning the possibility of ""co-burning"" 
ethanol and methane.  As a manufacturer they said they would be willing to 
work with us, however, they only recommended it if it were to be a constant 
fuel source.  Solar said there would be considerable fuel injection system 
retrofits required.  Also, if this were not a constant fuel then there would 
have to be two separate fuel systems (co-burn and methane only) and a 
complete fuel control system change.  With all that the project has been 
deemed cost prohibitive.

Vapor Injection of Propane (VIP Service)
Research was started for Marketing into the possibility of injecting 
vaporized propane into the pipeline as a way of increasing capacity during 
peak days.  Upon initial review many questions were generated by the planning 
team concerning specific requirements of the new service (i.e.: # of days/yr, 
firm, daily firm etc.)  Planning awaits feedback from Marketing before any 
more action is taken.

Electric Generation 
Proposal was reviewed for Marketing from APA for an engineering study to 
review the possibility of utilizing stand-by generators as electric producers 
for the Utilities during peak power times in the summer months.  A few 
discrepancies were found and are being worked out before APA can be released 
to complete the engineering study.

Beaver Dehy
A request was received from John Sturn of the optimization team to review the 
Capacity of the Mole sieve Dehy system at Beaver Compressor Station on the SE 
24"" line.  Beaver is considering a capital project to re-route the dehy 
system that is currently piped into the suction of the station to the 
discharge, thus increasing the capacity.  

Cogentrix Power Plant
Three detailed cost estimates for the Cogentrix Power Plant proposals were 
prepared and forwarded to Marketing.  The details of the cost estimate 
included a breakdown of costs for:
Material Costs
Labor
Freight and Taxes
Surveys/Permits
Construction Support
District Labor
Engineering/Drafting/As-builts
Contingency
Overhead
AFUDC
The break down of costs was done for the Sheldon, Lehigh, and Raun projects 
in Nebraska and Iowa.

Cherokee Ethanol Projects
Seven sites were examined for a proposed ethanol plant in Cherokee County, 
Iowa.  The delivery volume was for 8 MMCF/D at a delivery pressure of 70 
psig.  It was assumed for this study that the initial load would be for 4 
MMCF/D for two years and then increase to the 8 MMCF/D level.  The cost 
estimate assumed that the initial design would be for the 8 MMCF/D.  This was 
done to reduce the cost for the project.  Each cost estimate was done for a 
firm transport level and an interruptible transport level (14 cost estimates 
total).  Two of the sites are on the C line approximately 10 miles southwest 
of the Paullina Station.  The remaining sites were on the Storm Lake/Lytton 
Branchline."

Kansas City Business Journal ) 09/29/2000
By Brian Cookson

UtiliCorp United Inc. wants to parlay the rapid growth of its Aquila Energy 
subsidiary into a piece of a new, larger Aquila.

The Kansas City-based utility has plans to spin off Aquila, possibly 
retaining ownership of a third of it, selling another third to a partner and 
offering the remainder in the stock market.  The move could allow Aquila, now 
engaged primarily in trading power and natural gas, to gain more hard assets 
of its own and seek higher valuation from investors.

&We really think the value of our company is much higher than the market 
currently values it because it values it as a utility,8 Aquila spokesman Al 
Butkus said.

Aquila, which moved its headquarters to Kansas City last year, has been the 
engine behind earnings growth for UtiliCorp.  For the second quarter of this 
year, Aquila reported earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) of $49.5 
million, up 113 percent from the previous year.  UtiliCorp as a whole had 
EBIT of $103.9 million for the second quarter of 2000.

Aquila may be able to attract more interest because it wouldn,t carry the 
image of a traditional utility, Butkus said.

Richard Stuebi, president of Next Wave Energy, agreed.  The head of the 
Denver-based electricity consulting firm said Wall Street historically has 
undervalued conglomerates such as UtiliCorp.

&In general, the stock market prefers companies that are clean or pure 
plays,8 Stuebi said.

Aquila,s strategy comes as little surprise to Stuebi.  As much success as the 
company has had, he said he thought Aquila would need to get bigger to 
compete.

&In most aspects of the energy business, the race for scale is on,8 he said.

Aquila also could increase its value to shareholders by looking for hard 
assets to match its marketing prowess.  Aquila CEO Keith Stamm said the 
company could address this need by building, such as the new electric 
generation plant it is building in Pleasant Hill.  It also could buy 
generation capacity or take on a partner with electric generation capacity.

Stamm said the company is looking for such a partner but is keeping the other 
two options open.  Finding a partner with power plants could become easier as 
energy deregulation causes many utilities to look at separating generating 
operations from power sales and distribution.

Stamm said that Aquila has talked to several companies and that an 
announcement could come by the end of the year.

The timing of any initial public stock offering would be dependent on the 
results of the search for a partner.

Butkus said UtiliCorp isn,t sacrificing its hold on Aquila.  Instead, 
executives are hoping to own part of an infinitely more valuable company.

Aquila already is moving to enter a new market ) trading bandwidth, or 
capacity on communications networks.  Stamm said the bandwidth market is 
potentially several times larger than the energy market because 
communications networks can be linked by satellite to anywhere in the world.  
Gas pipelines require a physical connection.

Traders in the bandwidth market could include telecom companies or Internet 
providers that either have network capacity to sell or that need to boost 
their capacity.

&We like to see volatility, and we,re seeing it,8 Stamm said.

Aquila is adding a crew of 35 to 40 people to begin trading bandwidth by the 
end of the year.  It won,t be alone, however, as companies such as Houston,s 
Enron Corp. also are getting into bandwidth trading.

ENRON INVESTMENT PARTNERS' BIGGEST GAMBLE TO DATE HAS BEEN THE $4 MILLION IT 
pumped into Cynet. The software outfit relies on a wireless modem that plugs 
in to a laptop or PC and lets you e-mail, fax, and use voice-and 
data-messaging. That may not sound like much. But imagine e-mailing thousands 
of people at once--or sending a document and following with a prerecorded 
message to tell folks to check their fax machines. Cynet is also developing 
the ability to retrieve e-mail messages as voice mail on a laptop and to 
translate voice mail into e-mail.

The investment helped launch Cynet as the first African-American company to 
go public out of Houston. How's it doing? Not so hot. After the initial 
offering in January the stock jumped to $8, but it got pummeled in April and 
now hovers around $1. It has yet to recover. 

Still, Enron is holding on to its investment, now worth only $1.9 million. 
Cynet holds the exclusive North American marketing license for Teleran 
Electronic's wireless modems. That's got to be worth something. Compaq 
Computer is using the technology to add high-speed wireless Internet 
connections to its iPAQ Pocket."

One can surmise that quite a bit 
of the gas that was contracted for on Vector is 
firm utility gas.  The run up in Chicago may be temporary until alternate 
arrangements are completed.

Vector Delay Confirms Market's Suspicions

Future shippers on the new Chicago-to-Dawn Vector Pipeline had their fears 
confirmed Tuesday when pipeline officials announced that the start-up date 
for the project, which was scheduled for Nov. 1 to coincide with the start-up 
of the long-awaited Alliance Pipeline, would be delayed until Dec. 1. 

Vector officials blamed the delay on the excessive rainfall that has hampered 
construction of the pipeline, which --- when completed --- would provide 
initial takeaway for about 700 MMcf/d of the 1.3 Bcf/d of western Canadian 
gas that will be shipped to the Chicago market by Alliance. Alliance is due 
to begin operations on Oct. 31. 

The announcement yesterday left many in the market asking the million-dollar 
question: ""where will that [Alliance] gas go?"" in the meantime. Alliance 
officials noted the line has connections with existing pipelines and LDCs 
serving the Chicago hub that could pick up the slack between Oct. 31 and Dec. 
1. 

Alliance's Jack Crawford downplayed the impact of the Vector start-up delay 
on Alliance. ""We don't think [there will be] much effect at all. We have been 
working closely with Vector. Our connection with them, if it's not ready, is 
very close. We also have five other connections with other [existing] 
pipelines and LDCs"" in Chicago. Many shippers ""understand [that with ] a 
startup the magnitude of ours [Alliance] and Vector's, there are likely to be 
some bumps at beginning."" 

Immediate market reaction to the news was somewhat unexpected. The Chicago 
basis for November widened from a plus 9.5-10 to plus 11-12 Tuesday following 
Vector's announcement. That is contradictory to what you would think would 
occur, said a Chicago trader for a large marketing company. ""I was offering 
index-plus gas today betting on the chance that will come off by the time 
bidweek rolls around,"" he said. The effect on the market wasn't as profound 
as some would have thought, agreed another trader. ""In fact, Chicago prices 
actually strengthened on the news. You would think that with the excess gas 
on the market starting Nov 1, the basis would have come off. The only thing I 
can think is that people are betting on cold weather showing up in the 
Chicago market on Nov. 1 as well."" 

Meanwhile Dawn prices, which one would have expected to strengthen following 
the news, did so, as November basis widened from low 30s to plus 36 yesterday 
following the announcement, a Michigan trader said. 

The Vector Pipeline would transport much of the Alliance gas from the market 
hub in Chicago to the hub at Dawn, ON, as well as provide access to markets 
and storage in the upper Midwest. The line eventually will carry 1 Bcf/d, but 
its initial start-up delivery capacity will be 700 MMcf/d. The pipeline is 
slated to serve key markets in Ontario, Quebec, and the U.S. Midwest and 
Northeast. 

~Vector shippers were notified of the delay along with the rest of the market 
Tuesday, although many already had suspected the pipeline wouldn't be able to 
adhere to its scheduled start-up date. At an LDC forum in Chicago a few weeks 
ago, a spokesman for Vector insisted the pipeline was on schedule, but then 
sources said he showed pictures of parts of the pipeline underwater. ""Folks 
who were there knew what that meant."" 

Presently, more than 90% of the Vector line has been installed and progress 
on the Springville compressor station is on schedule, according to the 
company. The Dec. 1 start-up date includes adequate time for any further 
weather impacts and for the extensive commissioning and testing programs 
necessary, it said, adding Vector is scheduled to begin filling the system in 
late October to complete the commissioning of facilities. 

Sponsors of Vector include Calgary-based Enbridge Inc. with a 45% interest; 
Westcoast Energy Inc. of Vancouver, BC, with a 30% interest; and 
Detroit-based MCN Energy Group Inc. with a 25% interest."

continue to do so in the future. Technology has helped Enron create new 
businesses like Enron Broadband Services and Enron Net Works, and it is 
responsible for applications such as EnronOnline and EnronCredit.com.  You,ve 
seen what technology can do at work.  Now we want you and your family to 
realize its benefits at home.

With that in mind, we are excited to let you know that we are introducing the 
ClickAtHome
program, which will give each employee a computer for use at home. Where 
technology permits, we will also subsidize an Internet connection. With the 
click of a mouse, a home computer plus Internet access will put a world of 
Internet knowledge at your family,s fingertips.  

We have just signed an agreement with Dell Computer Corporation to provide 
the computer hardware. We wanted to let you know about the program now in 
case you and your family were considering the purchase or upgrade of a home 
computer or Internet connection in the next few months. The scope of 
ClickAtHome includes the following:

? Basic package: Dell desktop computer with a high-speed processor, floppy 
disk drive, mouse, speakers, monitor, modem, CD-ROM drive and Windows 2000 
software. Employees will have the option to receive a subsidized Internet 
connection, including broadband, where commercially available.
? Participation: This program will be available to active regular full-time 
and regular part-time employees of Enron and its wholly owned subsidiaries; 
however, employees of some Enron companies (Portland General Electric, EOTT, 
Enron Facility Services) may not be able to participate due to legal, 
accounting, tax, labor or business reasons.  Eligibility includes being 
employed at the time of implementation.  
? Timing: U.S. employee sign-up will begin in early 2001, with delivery of 
the equipment and Internet connection to follow shortly thereafter.  Delivery 
of equipment to participating non-U.S. employees is targeted for late 2001.

Details about this program are still being finalized.  To address some of 
your initial questions, we,ve posted a question-and-answer document on 
http://clickathome.enron.com.  We will schedule an eSpeak session in the near 
future where you will have an opportunity to ask questions. Or, you can 
submit your questions and comments to ClickAtHome@enron.com. 

We are excited to extend our investment in technology to you and your 
family.  We believe this program takes communication at Enron to a new level 
by creating endless possibilities for you to experience and participate in 
the broadband Internet revolution. It is just another reason why we believe 
Enron is a great place to work."

Kinder Morgan, Inc. announced plans to contribute $300 million in assets to 
Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, L.P., the company's master limited 
partnership. The largest asset to be contributed is Kinder Morgan Texas 
Pipeline, formerly MidCon Texas, a 2,600-mile natural gas pipeline system 
that extends from South Texas to Houston along the Texas Gulf Coast. 

Other assets include the Casper and Douglas Gas Gathering and Processing 
Systems, KMI's 50% interest in Coyote Gas Treating and KMI's 25% interest in 
Thunder Creek Gas Services. As consideration for the assets, KMI will receive 
$300 million, 50% in cash and 50% in KMP partnership units. KMI expects the 
transaction to be completed in the fourth quarter. 

""This transaction represents a true win-win for both KMI and KMP,"" said 
Kinder Morgan CEO Rich Kinder. ""It is expected to be accretive to cash 
available for distribution to KMP's unitholders by between 5-10 cents in 
2001. The pipeline assets are a good fit for KMP because they complement 
existing KMP assets, have long-term contracts in place and offer significant 
growth opportunities."" Kinder noted that because the mix of consideration 
paid will include equity issued to KMI, it will not be necessary to raise 
funds for the transaction via a public offering of KMP units. 

""KMI will also benefit from the transaction, as it will be able to reduce its 
debt by $150 million,"" Kinder said. ""Additionally, the transaction is 
expected to be modestly accretive to KMI's earnings per share in 2001. By 
increasing its stake in the master limited partnership, KMI will enjoy 
greater participation in the expected future growth of KMP."" 

Upon closing, KMP will have completed in excess of $600 million of 
acquisitions in 2000. In addition, this transaction will boost KMI's total 
asset contribution to KMP to more than $1 billion, far exceeding the original 
goal stipulated when Kinder Morgan merged with KN Energy last July."

inspection this week, TW engineering noticed SWG had installed a bypass-valve 
on their meter station at the new facility.  This bypass was not in the 
originally approved drawings.  TW's policy does not allow for a bypass unless 
the customer has a non-interruptible contract.  We are waiting for an 
explanation from SWG and will likely ask them to remove the extra pipe.

their open season.  540,000 Dth/d was their
established volume at the onset.  Also, it is interesting that they are 
naming the Oklahoma intrastate markets as their market
for the project.

Western Frontier Pipe Gets Rave Reviews

After successfully completing a non-binding open season on Sept. 21, for the 
Western Frontier project, Williams' gas pipeline unit plans to hold a binding 
open season in the near future to gauge the exact market interest in the 
project that would transport gas supply from the Rockies to the mid-continent 
region. 

""We are very pleased with the interest the market has shown in our Western 
Frontier Project. We continue to believe that Western Frontier will be a 
cost-effective way to bring economically-priced Rockies supply into the 
mid-continent,"" said Kim Cocklin, vice president of customer services and 
rates for Williams' Central and Texas Gas pipeline systems. 

The Western Frontier Project is expected to transport up to 540,000 dth/d 
from the Cheyenne Hub to Williams' Hugoton Compressor Station on the Central 
system in southwest Kansas and its Oklahoma-Hugoton pipeline. 

The project would also have access to ANR Pipeline, Panhandle Eastern 
Pipeline, Northern Natural Gas and Natural Gas Pipeline of America. Williams 
believes this project would be able to supply a ""seamless transport at an 
incremental cost"" to Oklahoma intrastate markets by way of the Central 
system. Through the Central system, customers would also be able to access 
storage including directly owned and third party storage fields. 

Williams expects Western Frontier's rates to Hugoton to fall in the mid-20 
cents per dth. The company also expects a fuel rate of less than 1%. Expected 
to be in service during November 2003, the project will require the 
construction of almost 400 miles of pipeline and the addition of 13,000 HP."

They also did not hedge their production, so are able to capture the higher

,06/22/2000,,enron.announcements@enron.com,all.worldwide@enron.com,,Reimbursement of Individually Billed Items,"The use of cell phones and pagers has increased dramatically in the past few 
years.  As a result the Accounts Payable department has seen a rapid increase 
in the number of invoices and vendors.  With the higher volume, we have 
reviewed our processes in order to continue our rapid payment cycle.

Although we encourage vendors to address their invoices to individual 
employees, they often mail invoices directly to Accounts Payable.  At times 
they fail to list the individual who uses the pager or cell phone.  In these 
cases we return the invoice to the vendor.  If the employee is designated, we 
try to track him/her down and forward the invoice.  The high level of 
employee movement among jobs and locations at Enron has made this 
increasingly challenging.  Either way, we end up doing something less 
productive than paying invoices.

To maintain satisfactory response to our vendors and to reduce time necessary 
for research, we request that employees who have pagers, cell phones, and 
other individually billed items such as licenses, subscriptions, etc., pay 
for them by personal check or charge card (if applicable*payment instructions 
are usually indicated on the invoice) and request reimbursement through 
employee expense reports. 

By submitting these charges on your expense report, you can help us reduce 
the amount of time spent researching and forwarding invoices, the number of 
checks generated by Treasury, the number of vendors in our database, and the 
turnaround time for payment of invoices."

,10/06/2000,,enron.announcements@enron.com,enron.customers@enron.com,,Enron Global Messaging Announcement,"Over the last few months, we have been discussing our standard E-mail 
platform with you, our customer.  Your feedback from the various 
demonstrations, surveys and Technology Showcases validated that E-mail is a 
vital part of your ability to communicate effectively.  However, your 
feedback also indicated that you need your E-mail client to have additional 
functionality and increased integration with other applications you use.  
Therefore, to meet the demands of our fast-paced business, Enron Net Works is 
standardizing our E-mail platform by deploying Microsoft Outlook 2000 to all 
the Business Units we currently support for messaging.  (Project plans for 
EBS, EES and Azurix are still being finalized and will be communicated 
separately.)

This conversion from Lotus Notes to Outlook 2000 will improve your ability to 
communicate and provide a more consistent look and feel across the standard 
office applications you use on a daily basis.  We are excited about this 
opportunity to provide a more robust, full function solution for your 
messaging needs.   To provide you with additional details about the 
conversion from Lotus Notes to Outlook 2000, we are including a list of 
frequently asked questions about this project.

How does this project affect me?
Your current Lotus Notes E-mail system will be converted to Microsoft Outlook 
2000.

What is Microsoft Outlook 2000?
Outlook 2000 is the messaging client you will use to read your E-mail, update 
your calendar and personal address book, record to do lists, etc.

Why are we switching to Outlook 2000?
Outlook 2000 integrates more effectively with our new operating system, 
Windows 2000, and the Microsoft products that Enron currently uses. With 
Outlook 2000, we can provide you with a more robust mail platform including 
the following new features:

Instant Messaging ) Ability to send person-to-person, immediate, pop-up 
messages.
Improved Palm/CE Synchronization ) Allows for simpler and quicker updates of 
your hand held device from multiple places.
Conferencing Server ) Ability to conduct video conferences from your desktop.
Web Access ) Ability to retrieve your Enron E-mail via a browser.
Fax Integration ) Ability to send/receive faxes from your E-mail Inbox.
Voice Mail Integration ) Ability to have your voice mail delivered to your 
E-mail Inbox for retrieval.

When will the Outlook 2000 rollout start and when will I get it?
The pilot will begin in late October with the production rollout beginning in 
late November.  We are finalizing our Business Unit rollout schedule.  
Additional information will be provided to all business units as it becomes 
available.  Project updates will be posted on the Project section of the IT 
Central web site at http://itcentral.enron.com.  Additionally, you may send 
questions to Outlook.2000@enron.com, and a member of the project team will be 
happy to address these individually."

     Americans can expect home heating prices to jump as much as 44%
this winter because of strong economic growth and high crude oil
prices, according to the EIA. A winter with especially long periods
of cold weather' could cause even higher prices because heating fuel
storage levels are below average. Homes that use natural gas can
expect to see the biggest jump in bills. Prices paid by residential
customers are expected to average $8.58 per MMBtu, up about 30% from
last winter's average of $6.61. The higher prices, combined with
increased consumption, will push overall costs up to an average $780
this winter from $540 last year earlier, the EIA said in an annual 
report on winter fuels. High prices for competing petroleum-based
fuels will help keep natural gas prices high. Homes with heating oil
will pay about $949 for fuel this winter, up 25% from the $760  paid
last winter. Prices will average about $1.37 per gallon, up 16% from
last year's $1.18, the report said. The 4.5% of Americans who use
propane to heat their homes will pay about 27% more this winter at
$1,045, compared with $823 last year. Inventories of propane at the
end of last month were about 62 million barrels, 3 million above last
year's level. Distillate stockpiles, which include heating oil and
diesel fuel, will be about 114 million to 118 million barrels at the
start of the heating season, about 15% to 18% lower than last year,
the report said. The government projection excludes the heating oil
reserve created by the Clinton administration, which stores 2 million
barrels. Distillate stocks in the East Coast are 41 million barrels,
close to 40% less than last year's level. In New England stocks are
over 60% below the 1999 level. The EIA estimated the monthly price of
crude oil will remain above $28 per barrel for the rest of the year,
and then gradually decline next year to an average $25 per barrel.
Because of rising demand in Asia and continued growth in the US,
higher oil production by OPEC has not been able to stem the rally in
prices, the report said. US crude oil inventories are about 287
million barrels, 17 million barrels below last year. The deficit is
smaller than last month, when there was a 26 million-barrel
shortfall, though supplies are still 8% below normal and are not
expected to move into the normal range before the end of winter, the
report said.  Global oil demand this year is expected to increase 1.1
million barrels per day from last year and will grow by an additional
2 million barrels a day in 2001 to 78 million barrels a day,
according to the report. The average retail price for gasoline, which
was about $1.52 per gallon last week, will fall to about $1.46 per
gallon in December and $1.40 by next March, the report said. The
report says a very cold winter could cause Northeast heating oil
prices to surge, and that could spill over into East Coast diesel
markets. The government said the chances of this were greater this
year because of tight distillate supplies, especially in the
Northeast. Diesel prices will fall by about $0.09 to $1.55 per gallon
in December and $1.35 by next summer, assuming normal conditions this
winter."

Bidding opened on Thursday 6/22; no bids have been received as yet but 
several shippers have indicated interest and plan on responding on Monday 
6/26.  Bids close at 2pm Monday 6/26.  Coincidentally, we received a call 
from Unbound Technology, a developer of wireless software technology.  
UnBound provides software architecture  that creates the connection between 
transaction processes and wireless services.  This potentially would allow TW 
to extend our e-commerce services beyond the desktop  to a wireless user 
through a customized, wireless interface (pagers, cell phones, etc.).  We 
have set a meeting with Unbound for next Wednesday.

Fuel Monetization
Implementation cost estimates are being finalized as customer interest is 
being evaluated for this potential service option.  Duke, Southern, and 
Reliant are all interested but only if they can have first call on the space 
created.  El Paso Merchant Energy is expected to provide Transwestern a 
proposal, early next week, for the potential monetization of the fuel 
component for their company's transportation contracts totaling 65,000 Dth/d 
of San Juan to California capacity.

Southern Company Energy Marketing
John Hogan was in town this week.  Southern has advanced to the second round 
of bidding on Nevada Power's generation assets which are scheduled to be sold 
off by the end of this year.  SCEM's Gallup agreement allows them to deliver 
to the new SWG delivery point on an alternate basis, but if Southern is 
successful in obtaining any of Nevada Power's gen assets, they may request to 
amend the delivery point on their Gallup contract.  SCEM is also very 
interested in any expansions TW may have in the near future.  Due to their 
affiliation with Vastar, they have a definite appetite for more San Juan to 
CA or NV transport.

Southern is interested in the possibility of buying options for capacity on 
TW and we requested that he get his regulatory group familiar with the idea 
in hopes that SCEM would support of our filing.

SCEM also plans to trigger its ROFR on their Ignacio to Blanco capacity 
(30,000/d) by the 7/1 deadline.

Duke
They have triggered their ROFR on the Ignacio to Blanco capacity (18,000/d) 
and this capacity will be posted on the Internet per TW's tariff the week of 
7/3.

Pueblo Project
Secretary of Energy Bill Richardson was excoriated this week in front of 
Senate panels reviewing his and the DOE's conduct regarding the missing 
computer hard drives at Los Alamos.  Since the Pueblo project hinged on the 
ability of Richardson to use his Secretarial discretion to create this sole 
source contract, with limited review by Congress, we can rest assured 
Congressional support for Richardson or any of his pet projects is 
non-existent.

Miscellaneous
Received a call from an irate Houston citizen complaining of ""aggressive"" 
driving by an 18-wheel motor fuel carrier with ""Transwestern"" painted on the 
truck.  We assured the caller it was not our truck and recommended he call 
the Tx DOT or sherriff's department."
,10/12/2000,,enron.announcements@enron.com,"analysts@enron.com, the.pulse@enron.com",,It's almost time,On Monday it will be time to check your pulse...
,10/12/2000,,ets.announcement@enron.com,the.pulse-ets@enron.com,,We want to check your pulse,"Once again, it's time to find out what you think about your work experience 
at Enron and Enron Transportation Services Company, and what we can do to 
help make it better.  That's why we want to check your pulse.  In fact, we've 
changed the name of last year's ""Excellence Through Communication"" employee 
survey to The Pulse.  We believe The Pulse more accurately captures the 
purpose of the survey.  Your diagnosis will help us correct problem areas so 
we can continue to make Enron a great place to work.

Is available:  Monday, Oct. 16 - Friday, Oct. 27
Is located at: survey.enron.com

There are a few things we want you to remember about The Pulse:

1. Your survey responses will be confidential.  You can complete your survey 
from special computer kiosks that will be set up in some of our larger 
offices.  Several group computer terminals also will be available in smaller 
field offices. We want to provide you with the most comfortable environment 
possible, as your participation is of vital importance to us. Alternatively, 
you can key in your responses from your desktop computer. The responses keyed 
from your desktop will be confidential as well.

2. We will respond actively to your comments.  We are going to do our best to 
cure some of the current problems that exist and put into action preventative 
processes that will help identify smaller problems before they become major 
ones.  We may ask for your help in resolving some of the issues that are 
collected in the survey - your active role will help us identify the best 
solutions.
In last year's survey, you identified several problem areas regarding 
internal communications, workload and performance management. We've already 
acted on many of your recommendations.  These are a few of the things we've 
accomplished in direct response to your input:

  ETS strengthened management focus on intellectual capital and employee 
through the initiation of:
  Table Talk sessions with ETS Office of the Chairman, which give employees 
the opportunity to have frontline discussions,
  The ""Innovation Series,"" which invites employees to share their ideas 
openly and ensures management commitment to evaluating ideas,
  E-Speak sessions with ETS leaders to exchange ideas, and
  Our name change to Enron Transportation Services to recognize our most 
strategic asset - you.

  We made workload planning and management training/development available to 
ETS employees to address workload issues, the greatest ETS concern in the 
survey.

  We improved the consistency of performance management, the survey topic 
that received the most employee comments, by extending the use of the 
Performance Evaluation Process (PEP) system and the Performance Review 
Committee (PRC) process to all levels in ETS at mid-year in 2000.

Please take a few minutes to check your pulse and tell us what you think and 
how you feel about your job and about Enron.

We look forward to hearing from you"

construction path for the interconnect, TW approved the installation of the 
meter bypass piping (we are waiting for engineering to confirm this).  If 
this is the case, we will ask SWG to install skillets or padlock the valves 
so it cannot be used without TW approval.  In addition, we are proposing to 
amend the start date of the SWG transport contract so that TW may resell the 
unused space in early November on a daily firm basis.  

USGT - US Gas Transportation is protesting the Market Center deal we 
negotiated during our brief September outage.  We re-negotiated the original 
invoice from $140,000 down to $113,000.  USGT has countered with $65,000 
citing mis-communication on the original deal.

Plains Farmer's Co-op - Higher gas prices have created an additional level of 
credit exposure across our customer base in terms of transportation 
balancing.  For September, this small Co-op had accumulated a balance payable 
to TW of approximately $440,000.  The customer indicated they would be 
sending us a payment of $250,000 but so far has only sent in $75,000.  Our

Innovation, itself, is nothing new.  The word comes to us from the Latin 
innovatus, which is a good indication of how long the concept has been 
around.  People have been searching for the ""next big thing"" for thousands of 
years.

We have quite a tradition of innovation here at Enron.  Although consistent 
innovation may sound like an oxymoron, we pride ourselves on consistently 
outpacing our peers with innovative ideas.

at Enron and what we can do to help make it better.  That's why we want to 
check your pulse.  In fact, we've changed the name of last year's ""Excellence 
Through Communication"" employee survey to The Pulse.  We believe The Pulse 
more accurately captures the purpose of the survey.  Your diagnosis will help 
us correct problem areas so we can continue to make Enron a great place to 
work.

Is available:  Monday, October 16 ) Friday, Oct. 27

smaller field offices.  We want to provide you with the most comfortable 
environment possible, as your participation is of vital importance to us.
2. We will respond actively to your comments.  We are going to do our best to 
cure some of the current problems that exist and put into action preventative 
processes that will help identify smaller problems before they become major 
ones.  We may ask for your help in resolving some of the issues that are 
collected in the survey ) your active role will help us identify the best 
solutions.
In last year's survey, you identified several problem areas regarding 
internal communications and we've already acted on many of your 
recommendations.  These are a few of the things we've accomplished or are 
working on in direct response to your input:
1. Require all executives (VP and above) to attend the Executive Impact & 
Influence course, which is a 360-degree program designed to improve 
leadership and communication skills.  By year-end, more than 90 percent will 
have attended this course, with the remaining 10 percent to be trained in the 
first quarter of 2001.
2. Offer all employees online communication courses.  These courses will be 
available in the first quarter of 2001.
3. Improve our online communication tools, beginning in the fourth quarter, 
2000:
   w Simplify and standardize Enron directories
   w Educate all employees about the availability and usage of IT tools.
   w Promote intelligent/responsible use of email.
4. Introduce Participation & Dissent (P&D) sessions to provide a vehicle for 
solving problems, addressing issues and developing new opportunities.  This 
application will launch in the first quarter of 2001 in the ThinkBank on

In the merger, Texaco shareholders will receive 0.77 shares of Chevron

premium based upon the two companies' average relative share prices during
the 30-day period through October 13.  As a result of the merger, Chevron

Title: Monthly Briefing: Turning on the Heat
Author: N. American Gas Team
E-Mail Category: Alert
Product Line: North American Gas ,
URL: http://www.cera.com/cfm/track/eprofile.cfm?uU26&m90 ,

*********************************************************

The nervousness driving the gas market that had settled just below the 
surface during
the relative calm of late September and early October reemerged in force last 
week.
of
mild weather, storage injections above 10 billion cubic feet (Bcf) per day, 
and a lack
of storms in producing areas of the Gulf of Mexico had calmed the market
somewhat. Henry Hub prices settled near $5.00 in the cash market, less than 
$0.20
above residual fuel oil. Last week, however, tragedy in the Middle East and a 
slightly
lower-than-expected storage injection report were sufficient to drive November
Henry Hub prices up by more than $0.50 in two days, to above $5.60.

Mild weather may still soften prices from current levels, but CERA does not 
expect
the relative calm of late September and early October to return to the gas 
market.
Turmoil in the oil market has raised the floor for gas prices, as nearly 1.5 
Bcf per day
of potential gas demand now burning residual fuel oil would quickly return to 
the gas
market should prices decline relative to oil. Also, weather must remain mild 
through
October, or else US working storage inventories may not reach even 2.7 
trillion
cubic feet (Tcf) by the end of the month. The headroom for price is much 
greater, as
distillate oil, the next substitute for gas should gas prices rise, is itself 
in short
supply. Shutdowns of industrial facilities represent an important increment of
demand resistance as gas prices rise, and neither switching to distillate nor 
shutting
down production comes easily or cheaply.

Time is running out before the heating season begins, and the market remains
justifiably on edge: upward volatility remains much more likely than any 
significant
settling in price. As a result, CERA expects natural gas prices to be 
sustained in the
mid-$5.00s, averaging $5.50 at the Henry Hub during November (see Table 1). 
More
luck--a great deal more--would be required to restore a measure of calm to 
the gas
market.

Gas Storage--The Final Push
October storage injections have varied historically from 4.0 Bcf to 
approximately 8.5
Bcf per day in the United States, and this year CERA expects them to average 
5.5
Bcf per day, a moderate level for the month (see Table 2). The reporting of 
injections
of 62 Bcf during the week ending October 6 precipitated a $0.37 increase in 
futures
prices, but this rate is actually above average for the first full week of 
October. With
the beginning of consistent heating load late this month CERA expects a 
slowing of
injections, resulting in an end-of-October inventory of 2,707 Bcf--more than 
100
Bcf below the previous record low for the end of October.

CERA expects that many storage holders--having begun the winter with record 
low
inventories--will preserve inventories to the extent possible during November.
However, normal weather this year would drive a substantial rebound in 
heating load
from last year,s level and would require added storage withdrawals, which CERA
estimates will average 5.0 Bcf per day this year. Withdrawals at that pace, 
or even
substantially slower (as occurred during 1998 and 1999), will keep 
inventories on a
trajectory to hit record lows by the end of March. Low storage inventories 
will
remain a major source of price support, requiring that demand continue to be 
priced
out of the gas market, and keeping gas prices above those of residual fuel 
oil.
Regional Markets-Winter Rules

The transition to winter pricing relationships is under way, and the start of 
winter
heating demand in the West has narrowed differentials between the supply-rich
Rocky Mountains and the Henry Hub. Local demand for Rockies supply has also
eased pressure on San Juan Basin prices, and CERA expects differentials 
between
both regions and the Henry Hub to continue to narrow through November. In the
Northeast differentials will begin to widen with the onset of winter, with the
magnitude of the differentials depending on early winter weather. The onset 
of flows
on Alliance will limit increases in the Chicago differential during November 
(see
Table 3).

CERA,,s outlook by region follows:

* Rockies. Early-season cold has narrowed Rockies to Henry
Hub differentials so far this month. Ample supplies within the
Rockies will mean volatile pricing relationships through the
end of October and early November depending on heating load,
but in general strong regional demand will keep differentials
well below the ($1.00) per MMBtu summer level. CERA
expects a ($0.45) per MMBtu differential to the Henry Hub
during November.

* San Juan. The increase in local heating demand in the Rockies
will continue to ease pressure on San Juan prices by limiting
flows south out of the Rockies. San Juan differentials should
follow the same relationships as Rockies prices, with general
narrowing but continued volatility through November. CERA
expects an average San Juan differential of ($0.38) per MMBtu
for November.

* Permian and Mid-Continent. Tight relationships between the
Permian Basin and Mid-Continent and the Henry Hub should
continue through November, with some slight widening in the
Mid-Continent basis differential expected when Alliance flows
commence. CERA expects differentials of ($0.11) per MMBtu
and ($0.08) per MMBtu, respectively.

* Chicago. The beginning of service via the Alliance Pipeline
during November is the focus of most attention in the Chicago
citygate market. However, the demand rebound that would
result from normal November weather this year would offset
most of the added supplies. As a result, Chicago differentials
will average in the $0.08-$0.20 per MMBtu range even when
Alliance flows commence, although delay of the Vector
Pipeline will keep much of the new gas in the Midwest. CERA
expects average November Chicago differentials of $0.13 per
MMBtu.

* Northeast markets. Normal weather would drive a substantial
rebound in New York citygate prices from year-earlier levels,
but there is little added delivery capacity into that market.
CERA expects New York to price $0.66 above the Henry Hub
during November, well above the current low o mid-$0.30s.

Canadian Markets--Supply Growth Still Uncertain
The supply build is uncertain at this time because flows on Alliance are 
uncertain. A
line pack of between 5 and 6 Bcf has been established, and modest flows of 
200-300
million cubic feet (MMcf) per day have been initiated to test and commission 
the
pipeline. The start-up is still slated for November 1, but the unknown 
quantities of
gas that are flowing on a day-to-day basis are making it difficult to assess 
precisely
the volume of supply being produced. At this time, it appears that October is 
on par
with 1999. The current expectation is for over 15,500 well completions in 
2000,
approximately 8,500 of which are expected to be gas wells. Even if the 
shallow trend
does not change substantially, the sheer number of wells is still expected to 
produce
a supply build by year-end and into 2001. For 2000, the total western supply 
build is
expected to be flat with 1999 to slightly negative, increasing to positive 
growth of
350 MMcf per day in 2001.

Demand Slow but Exports Up
TransCanada flows are still down, averaging about 350 MMcf per day less in
October than the year-earlier levels. Storage injections in the East have 
accelerated;
eastern inventories are expected to be above last year,s levels at the end of 
October.
Storage injections in the West, however, have dwindled, revising the expected
storage inventories to be even with the five-year average but below 1999 
levels.
PG&E GT-NW volumes have declined in October and are expected to be slightly
below 1999 levels by 50-100 MMcf per day in November as well. Northern Border
Pipeline is running about 50 MMcf per day above October 1999 but is expected 
to be
slightly below 1999 levels in November. Cooler-than-normal weather has pushed
western Canadian demand up slightly but does not offset the lower eastern 
Canadian
demand.

High Prices, Wide Differentials
The AECO-Henry differential has leveled off in the upper US$0.50s to low
US$0.60s and is expected to remain in that range through the balance of 
October.
For November the differential is expected to average US$0.50, for a resulting 
AECO
average of C$6.97 per gigajoule (US$5.00 per MMBtu).

,10/19/2000,,office.chairman@enron.com,all.worldwide@enron.com,,Organizational Changes,"Changes in Enron's business require us to reevaluate how we approach the 
engineering and construction function within Enron.  Specifically,  Enron 
Energy Services' (EES) business has grown dramatically and that requires 
considerable additional engineering and construction resources both to 
develop solutions for customers and to deliver those solutions to customers.  
Additionally, in light of Enron's continued emphasis on increasing our return 
on invested capital, we have been engaged in fewer large scale construction 
projects around the world.  Historically, these projects have been a primary 
focus of EECC's activities.  Consequently we are making the following 
organizational changes concerning EECC:

EECC's pipeline construction group, led by Jerry Martin, will become part of 
Enron Transportation Services.  
NEPCO will continue to operate as a stand alone entity focused on power plant 
construction services to Enron entities and third parties.
The remainder of EECC will become part of EES.  Larry Izzo will report to the 
EES Office of the Chairman.
 
 These changes will better align our intellectual capital with the growth 
opportunities within Enron and provide new and exciting opportunities for our 
employees.  Please join us in supporting and implementing these changes."

In a move that is likely to send ripples through the market, particularly 
around Chicago, the 1.325 Bcf/d Alliance Pipeline extended its commercial 
in-service delay last week to Nov. 13 from Oct. 30. Pipeline officials said 
moisture and debris in the line caused the delay. 

""As we have increased the flow of test gas volumes during our system 
commissioning, we have encountered moisture and debris from construction,"" 
said CEO Norm Gish. ""Specifically, most of the debris is in the form of small 
pieces of foam from the [smart] pigs that were used to remove the hydrostatic 
testing water from the line. The problem forced us to shut down the system 
for short periods of time to clean out accumulated debris. 

""We have since designed and installed additional in-line screens at our 
compressor stations. The situation is improving and we are removing 
ever-decreasing amounts of debris with increased flows of test gas. However, 
this situation has not permitted us to run our system with the significant 
volumes necessary to adequately test the reliability of our compressors."" 

It is the second time Alliance has had to delay its in-service date. In early 
September, Alliance officials said rain in Saskatchewan this summer, 
directional drilling problems at a creek in British Columbia, complex 
connection problems with the Aux Sable liquids plant in Illinois and 
connection delays with several U.S. pipelines and LDCs was to blame for a 
one-month delay to Oct. 30 (see Daily GPI, Sept. 11). 

The pipeline will continue increasing test volumes until it begins commercial 
service, said Gish. There currently is about 500 MMcf/d of test gas in the 
line. He expects firm delivery capacity to reach the full 1.325 Bcf/d prior 
to Nov. 13. 

Alliance officials also noted that this is the first time a pipeline the size 
of Alliance has been brought on stream at one time. 

Regardless of the challenge, however, market participants were expecting the 
system to be delivering gas starting at the beginning of the month of 
November and this delay is likely to have a significant impact on November 
bidweek trading. 

One Chicago trader said he had a strong suspicion something was fishy when 
his index offers were lifted Friday afternoon by a marketing company, which 
he knows to own capacity on the pipe. ""Everyone was a buyer of index gas 
today for November, especially those now short for the first 13 days. I sold 
mine at NGI plus 1.5, but had I known that Alliance was delayed I would have 
held out for something a little better."" 

Basis, meanwhile, was pretty much unchanged at +13 to +14 for November. ""It 
takes a lot to move the Chicago basis,"" he said."

+Calpine to Acquire SkyGen Energy

Calpine Corp. said it plans to acquire SkyGen Energy LLC (SkyGen Energy)
from Michael Polsky and from Wisvest Corp., a Wisconsin Energy Corp.
affiliate, for $450 million, plus the assumption of certain obligations of
SkyGen Energy. The SkyGen Energy acquisition -- along with other recently
announced acquisitions -- would increase Calpine's 2004 operating portfolio
to over 40,000 MW of generation.

Upon closing of the transaction, expected during the third quarter of 2000,
Calpine will increase its power portfolio by up to 13,500 MW of natural
gas-fired generation in the U.S., and will acquire 34 General Electric 7 FA
gas turbines. Under terms of the agreement, Calpine will add three operating
facilities (780 MW), three projects under construction (812 MW), 13
late-stage development facilities (5,258 MW) and 16 project development
opportunities (6,615 MW).

SkyGen was founded by Michael Polsky in 1991. SkyGen will continue to
develop its portfolio of development projects as a wholly owned subsidiary
of Calpine. Michael Polsky will serve as President of SkyGen and as a member
of Calpine's Board of Directors. To fund the SkyGen Energy and other
recently announced acquisitions, Calpine has obtained a $1 billion
short-term credit facility with The Bank of Nova Scotia, Credit Suisse First
Boston and CIBC World Markets. The company expects to refinance this
facility in the capital markets.

**********
+Panda, Calpine Form Business Alliance

Panda Energy International and Calpine Corp. formed a  business alliance
involving eight power plant projects Panda has under development,
representing nearly 10,000 MW of generating capacity. Under terms of the
agreement, Panda will provide development capabilities and carry each of the
projects to the construction phase. Calpine will have exclusive rights to
construct, own and operate the plants. Panda will participate in 50% of the
cash flow, above Calpine's priority return, in all the projects within the
alliance.

Included in the pact is the acquisition by Calpine of 24 General Electric
7FA combustion gas turbines and 12 steam turbines scheduled for delivery in
2001 to 2002. The first project to be developed under the alliance will be
the Oneta Power Partners, L.P., a 1,000 MW  natural gas-fueled power plant
now being built in Coweta, OK. Under terms of the agreement, Calpine will
pay Panda approximately $126 million, which includes reimbursement of
development costs, payments for the gas and steam turbines and the Oneta
facility. The Oneta transaction is expected to close in July. It is
scheduled to go into service in 2002."

,10/25/2000,,enron.announcements@enron.com,all.america@enron.com,,Super Saturday Changes,"The recruiting season has officially begun.  The first Super Saturday weekend 
is the weekend of October 27th and 28th.  We have undergone a rigorous 
interview process on campus, which will allow us to focus on &selling8 
candidates that are invited to Houston for Super Saturday.  Students will 
arrive on Friday afternoon and will depart on Sunday morning.  We have 
activities planned for the entire weekend.  The goal is to implement a Super 
Saturday process that allows for consistent and meaningful hiring decisions 
while also allowing the candidates exposure to a greater number of Enron 
employees.  To that end, we have made the following changes:
Friday Evening Dinner.    The dinners will be held at the same restaurant.   
We will provide transportation for all candidates.  We will continue to have 
small tables of six individuals that will include two (2) Enron employees and 
four (4) students.  There will be a group cocktail hour at the restaurant 
before the dinner.  This will enable the Enron employees to meet and evaluate 
more students.  It will also give the students broader exposure to Enron 
employees.
Saturday Interviews.   Interviewers will receive their interview packages 
(schedules and resumes) at breakfast on Saturday morning. This will 
facilitate last minute cancellations of interviewers and/or candidates.  We 
have allowed time to review resumes before the interview process. To 
facilitate the completion of the evaluation form on each student, the 
interviewers will remain in an assigned interview room and the students will 
rotate. 
In prior years, the interviewers have interviewed eight (8) candidates.  
Interviewers will now interview only five (5) candidates.  The remainder of 
the time will be spent in the decision-making meeting. It is essential that 
all interviewers attend the decision-making meeting and that all evaluation 
forms are completed and input prior to the meeting. 
Decision-Making Meeting.   Rather than asking the interviewers to return on 
Monday afternoon, we will hold the decision-making meeting on Saturday 
following the interviews and lunch.  The meetings are scheduled from 1:30 PM 
to 3:30 PM and will be facilitated by members of Enron,s executive management 
team.  Dave Delainey will facilitate the October 28 meeting.  Kevin Hannon, 
Jeff Shankman, John Lavorato, Rick Causey and Dan Leff will facilitate 
subsequent meetings. 
Need for interviewers.  There has been a tremendous response to the call for 
dinner participants; however, we are still in need of interviewers for each 
of the Super Saturdays.  Please respond with your willingness to interview 
at:  http://axis.enron.com/notice/ssinvite.asp    
(When selecting dates please avoid selecting to interview candidates who 
attend the schools for which you are a team member).

settlement letter with El Paso has been paid back to TW as of October 25.  

Southwest Gas - SWG agreed to amend the start date of their transport 
contract to November 15.  TW resold the space along with an additional 1000 
MMBtu/d for a total of 15,000 MMBtu/d to Sempra Energy at $0.15 (slightly 
above market but equal to the rate SWG was originally paying).  Morgan 
Gottsponer sold Sempra the gas for this transport deal.

Burlington Resources' Val Verde Plant - We held another conference call with 
BR this week to finally resolve the outstanding issue of TW's obligation to 
take 250,000 MMBtu/d from Burlington's Val Verde plant.  Operational 
restrictions and San Juan temperatures seasonally affect the amount of volume 
TW is capable of receiving from Val Verde.  BR had claimed damages of nearly 
$3,000,000 from having to sell San Juan gas into less attractive markets 
because TW could not take all their volume.  

Upon investigation, there were actually very few days in which TW hampered 
Burlington's deliveries; but TW does have an exposure here for a contractual 
commitment that operationally we cannot meet on a year-round basis without 
spending several million dollars for additional compression.   In exchange 
for Burlington signing an amended operating agreement that meets both parties 
needs, TW has agreed to refund $100,000 of transport charges to BR for gas 
they moved this summer down the San Juan lateral.

Transport Options Program - Comments and interventions on this filing are due 
from interested parties by the close of business Monday October 30th.  

Duke Energy - We are working on a 100,000 MMBtu/d east-to-east transport deal 
with Duke beginning in January 2001 for one to two years at a rate of $.02 
-.03.  This deal would justify the capital expenditure to replace the coolers 
at WT-2 and give TW another 50,000 MMBtu/d flow capacity on the west Texas 
lateral.  However, Duke wants alternative flow capability west to the border 
at an incremental $.06.  As an alternative, we are proposing an index-based 
sharing mechanism for the west flow but Duke is balking (current market for 
calendar 2001 net of fuel is $.205)."

Title: No Rest for a Weary Market
Author:
E-Mail Category: Alert
Product Line: Western Energy ,

*********************************************************

Rather than enjoying a respite, western energy markets will make November
a catch-up month. Natural gas demand will remain high when compared with
the same period last year, as gas-fired generation will continue to run at 
high
utilization rates and market participants try to restore gas storage to normal
levels. The tight supply situation will maintain upward pressure on gas
prices, which will range from $5.15 to $5.83 per million British thermal
units, depending on location. Refueling outages at three nuclear units, along
with a seasonal decline in hydroelectric output, will maintain gas-fired
generation on the margin for most of November. On-peak power prices will
remain higher as a result, in the $86-$98 per megawatt-hour range,
depending on location.

,06/26/2000,,enron.announcements@enron.com,all.worldwide@enron.com,,UPDATE - Reimbursement of Individually Billed Items,"The use of cell phones and pagers has increased dramatically in the past few 
years.  As a result the Accounts Payable department has seen a rapid increase 
in the number of invoices and vendors.  With the higher volume, we have 
reviewed our processes in order to continue our rapid payment cycle.

Although we encourage vendors to address their invoices to individual 
employees, they often mail invoices directly to Accounts Payable.  At times 
they fail to list the individual who uses the pager or cell phone.  In these 
cases we return the invoice to the vendor.  If the employee is designated, we 
try to track him/her down and forward the invoice.  The high level of 
employee movement among jobs and locations at Enron has made this 
increasingly challenging.  Either way, we end up doing something less 
productive than paying invoices.

To maintain satisfactory response to our vendors and to reduce time necessary 
for research, we request that employees who have pagers, cell phones, and 
other individually billed items such as licenses, subscriptions, etc., pay 
for them by personal check or charge card (if applicable*payment instructions 
are usually indicated on the invoice) and request reimbursement through 
employee expense reports. 

By submitting these charges on your expense report, you can help us reduce 
the amount of time spent researching and forwarding invoices, the number of 
checks generated by Treasury, the number of vendors in our database, and the 
turnaround time for payment of invoices.  

Incidentally, Accounts Payable is currently installing a corporate-wide 
web-based expense reporting system similar to what Enron International has 
used for the past year.  This will make it even easier to file your expense 
report and receive quick reimbursement.

We,d like to make this effective immediately.  If you have any questions or 
suggestions, please contact the Accounts Payable department."

Within hours of a FERC vote yesterday ratifying proposed changes in its 
interruptible transportation (IT) queue, PG&E Gas Transmission Northwest 
announced new procedures effective today. 

The Commission rejected shippers complaints to the new scheme and accepted 
PG&E NW's tariff sheets as of Oct. 25, saying the revisions were ""generally 
in accord with industry practice and will simplify capacity allocation 
procedures."" 

Under the revised tariff PG&E NW said ""IT capacity will be allocated as 
follows: 

 First to shippers paying maximum rate; 

 If there are more confirmed IT nominations from shippers all paying the 
maximum rate, then IT capacity will be allocated pro-rata to the confirmed 
nominations.~ For example, if the capacity constraint were at Station 14, a 
shipper with a confirmed nomination paying maximum rate from Stanfield to 
Malin would be allocated capacity pro rata with a shipper with a confirmed 
nomination at the maximum rate for service from Kingsgate to Malin. 

 Second to shippers paying discounted rates or negotiated rates at less then 
the maximum rate. The discounted/negotiated IT space will be allocated on 
highest to lowest total revenue (rate x mileage).~ For example, a shipper 
with a confirmed nomination for service with a total revenue per Dth of $0.11 
would be awarded capacity ahead of a shipper with a confirmed nomination for 
service with a total revenue of $0.10, regardless of the path nominated. 

 Discounted IT shippers having the same total revenue will be allocated space 
on a pro ration of their confirmed nominations."" 

Questions can be addressed to PG&E NW's transportation coordinator at 
503-833-4300."

,06/27/2000,,gpg.announcement@enron.com,gas.operations@enron.com,,DRAFT - SAFETY ADVISORY BULLETIN No. 6,"The GPG Safety Declaration of Interdependence signed by all GPG pipeline 
operations staff is our promise to each other that safety on the job is first 
before all other concerns, that we will positively act to assure safe 
practices. This Safety Advisory Bulletin No. 6 is issued to reinforce the 
need for personal safety at all times and in all circumstances.

On April 12, a One-Call ticket was issued for the work being done adjacent to 
one of GPG,s pipelines. The ticket did not identify GPG as having facilities 
in the area so GPG was not notified. 

Sometime after April 12, a GPG employee observed a contractor working in the 
vicinity of an active pipeline. The employee located and marked the pipeline 
in the area where the contractor was working. On May 8, the contractor was 
excavating approximately 75 to 100 feet downstream of the marked pipeline, 
routing a water line, and uncovered a 12-inch pipeline that was assumed to be 
abandoned. The contractor was willing to incur the cost of removing a section 
of the abandoned pipeline if the facility owner would ensure it was 
abandoned. 

The contractor requested a One-Call ticket to mark all underground facilities 
in the area of the excavated 12-inch pipeline. GPG was notified, via fax, of 
the line locate request. The GPG employee who previously had located and 
marked the pipeline informed the contractor that he was unaware of any 
abandoned pipelines in the area, but that he would investigate further.  The 
employee checked his pipeline drawings and consulted with other team members 
and learned that there was an abandoned pipeline in the area. Team members 
also informed him that the accepted practice for checking abandoned pipelines 
was to drill into the pipe.  

On May 9, the GPG employee entered the contractor's excavation and drilled 
into what he assumed was the abandoned pipeline. The employee, believing the 
escaping medium was air, decided to let the pipe vent until the pressure 
relieved. After two hours of venting and no noticeable reduction in pressure, 
the employee re-entered the excavation to check cathodic protection readings. 
At this point the employee determined that the drilled pipeline was venting 
gas. Gas Control was informed of the situation and steps to shut-in, blow 
down and repair the pipeline were implemented.    

After a thorough inquiry by the GPG Incident Investigation Team, the Senior 
O&M Tech involved in the incident was disciplined as a result of his failure 
to follow the procedures listed below, and to reinforce the importance of 
safety interdependency. 

GPG Operating Procedures, 110.310, Gas Testing; 110.170 Confined Space Entry; 
110.260 Excavation; and 110.570 Work Permits :
No gas testing was done by the GPG employee to identify escaping medium.
No gas testing was done before the GPG employee entered the excavation 
considered to be a permit entry confined space.
No gas testing was done before an ignition source was introduced into a 
possibly hazardous atmosphere in the excavation.
No Confined Space Entry permit was issued when the employee re-entered the 
excavation to take cathodic protection readings.
The employee entered an excavation with inadequate means of egress.
No hot work permits were issued by the employee.

GPG Operating Procedure, Blowdown and Purging 80.409 :
The employee did not communicate, in a timely manner, the planned blowdown to 
residents of the adjacent neighborhood.

GPG Operating Procedure, Event Notification Sequence  10.101A :
Gas Control did not notify the GPG environmental specialist of the release of 
natural gas.

GPG Environmental Procedure, Spills and Releases 2.1.10  :
The release of natural gas was not reported to the GPG Division Environmental 
Specialist.

GPG Operating Procedure,  Damage Prevention 80.102 :   
The employee did not properly use maps when marking the pipeline.
The employee did not mark bends or other changes in the direction of the 
pipeline.

PLEASE NOTE THE PRACTICE OF DRILLING INTO A PIPELINE TO DETERMINE IF IT IS 
ABANDONED IS UNACCEPTABLE AND SHALL NOT BE UTILIZED.

Pre-existing abandoned pipe removal practice shall be as follows :

GPG employees shall contact local management when a pre-existing abandoned 
pipeline must be removed to allow routing of other facilities. Local 
management will contact the Engineering Department to evaluate the facility 
and provide guidance to the team on how to proceed with pipeline 
identification and the ensuing removal of the facility. 

Abandoned pipelines that will not be removed shall be treated as an active 
pipeline and marked in accordance with  GPG operating procedure 80.102

Moving Forward

The Pipeline Safety Department will review and revise GPG Operating Procedure 
80.102 to ensure that team members use all available resources to clearly 
identify an existing pipeline as active or abandoned.

The GPG Pipeline Safety Department is investigating why the GPG facility was 
not identified on the April 12 One-Call ticket. 


Near Misses

 There was potential for the contractor's backhoe operator to rupture and 
ignite an active pipeline.

Duke Stands By California Market

In the midst of much uncertainty surrounding California's power situation, 
Duke Energy North America Monday reiterated its commitment to the state's 
struggling wholesale electricity market, announcing new bilateral power deals 
with Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and progress with redevelopment plans at 
three coastal power plant sites it is operating. 

""Duke is committed to continue playing a major role to help California 
address its electricity shortfall and the high prices many felt this summer,"" 
said Bill Hall, Duke's vice president for the western region in North 
America, noting that brownfield projects in California have turned out to be 
more difficult than new plants to site, based on Duke's experience over the 
last three years. 

In response to questions, Hall acknowledged that Duke is constantly 
reassessing its position in California and a return by the state energy 
officials to a cost-based regulated market would cause him a lot of concern, 
but he is confident at this point that for the long-term market solutions 
will be applied. He said in his meetings with state political and regulatory 
leaders he is convinced they know the state can't turn back to a traditional 
command-and-control regulatory structure and they recognize that ""multiple 
solutions"" are needed, including balancing supply/demand for power. 

""We believe that new generation coming on line throughout the West in the 
next few years will lessen the market volatility and markets will begin to 
react based on supply/demand stability,"" Hall said. 

Both Hall's and Duke's western trading executive, Nancy DeSchane, said they 
are very anxious to see what the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission 
releases Wednesday with its initial draft decision on what it will do to 
address California wholesale electricity prices, including whether it intends 
to extend the California Independent System Operator's (Cal-ISO's) authority 
to impose price caps. 

Hall said Duke has signed a series of ""substantial long-term wholesale 
electricity contracts"" with PG&E's utility that will ""help stabilize the 
price volatility for the distributor's retail customers."" He would not 
disclose the terms of the deal, including the volumes and duration, but said 
the supplies are slated to be received in the state's northern zone (NP-15). 
Earlier Duke offered California utilities five-year deals at $50/MWh. Duke's 
Salt Lake City-based trading arm is doing the deal, rather than its 
California-based generation plants, meaning the power could come from sources 
inside or outside of the state. 

Hall said Duke has begun work with local city officials in the San Diego 
suburb of Chula Vista to accelerate the current schedule for replacing the 
South Bay Power Plant, which Duke leases with an option to buy. ""We hope 
within the next year we'll be able to announce what we can do to expedite the 
replacement of this facility,"" he said. 

Following approvals from the state and a local water permit last week, Duke 
will begin its $500 million modernization of Moss Landing Power Plant along 
the north central coast ""within the next 30 to 60 days,"" Hall said. The 
upgrade will add 1,060 MW to the site's current 1,500-MW capacity and will 
require a 30-40% increase in the plant's natural gas requirements, which 
PG&E's gas utility assures can be handled by the existing pipeline 
infrastructure. 

""We've had discussions with PG&E, and we're obviously concerned that we have 
sufficient infrastructure to transport gas that we purchase into the system,"" 
Hall said. ""We're confident that their infrastructure can support Moss,"" 
although, he added, that statewide ""we certainly have concerns about the gas 
infrastructure"" and Duke is working with state officials to assure there are 
adequate gas supplies. 

""We had some problems this summer in Southern California, and San Diego Gas 
and Electric recently announced it is going to begin an intense look at what 
needs to be done to upgrade its (gas pipeline) infrastructure to support the 
new generation plants coming on board."" 

Salt Lake City-based DeSchane said Duke has a ""balanced"" portfolio of supply 
and storage contracts, noting that she thinks her company has a ""very strong 
physical position in the West for gas,"" and the trading unit will be working 
over the next couple of years ""to assure that the gas position is sustained 
and continues to grow."" 

Down the central coast about 80 miles at Morro Bay, Duke has resubmitted 
revised plans for totally replacing the 1950s-era power plant in a renovation 
that will build a new $600 million 1,200-MW plant. With prompt state 
approvals, Hall said Duke could bring the new plant online by the summer of 
2003 and demolish the existing (1,000-MW) plant by 2007, adding that PG&E 
cannot deliver additional gas supplies so the added output is a product of 
the anticipated improved efficiency of the new plant."

See the link below that can be checked for 
updates.

Enron's Lay Urges Bold Solutions to Power Market Woes

As the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission prepared to weigh in this morning 
with the federal government's answer to California's be-deviled power market, 
free market advocates issued last minute warnings against taking the price 
cap route espoused by the Cal-ISO. FERC's meeting is scheduled to start at 9 
AM EST. (Check http://intelligencepress.com this morning for updates) 

In a letter fired off to FERC Chairman James J. Hoecker yesterday, Enron CEO 
Kenneth Lay urged the Commission to find a fix for the underlying structural 
problems in the power market rather than follow the steps of policy makers 
who have placed ""price cap 'band aids' over hemorrhaging wounds."" 

Lay told Hoecker the power market is ""halfway across a busy street in its 
transition from monopoly to competition. It can't stand where it is."" He said 
FERC has to make a choice between falling into the ""same trap of political 
expediency as California's ISO, leaving the nation's electric system in the 
lurch from one crisis to the next, [o]r it can take a big step toward 
fundamental structural reform."" 

At the same time the Electric Power Supply Association (EPSA) called on FERC 
to issue an emergency cease and desist order prohibiting the Cal-ISO from 
""unilaterally implementing"" any changes to its current $250/MWh price cap for 
wholesale electricity purchases. In a motion filed Monday, the marketer group 
specifically asked the Commission to bar the Cal-ISO board of directors from 
putting into effect its decision to impose a fiendishly complex 
load-differentiated price cap of $100 or less during the off-peak season 
effective Nov. 3. The plan was designed by the state's main utility consumer 
group (see Daily GPI, Oct. 30). In addition, the EPSA urged FERC to ""state 
explicitly"" that the Cal-ISO does not have the authority to impose or extend 
price or bid caps, unless expressly authorized to do so by the Commission. 
The Cal-ISO's current authority to set price caps expires on Nov. 15. 

Lay said the Cal-ISO's complicated new formula caps prices below the cost of 
gas-fired generation, ""making obvious errors such as failing to take into 
account gas transportation costs between the Henry Hub and power plants in 
California; in doing so the bid cap makes it more economic for generators to 
sell their gas supply, rather than use it to make electricity in California."" 
The new formula also forces the ISO into the market to buy power on an ad hoc 
basis ""to keep the lights on when the capped market fails to attract 
sufficient supplies (which it inevitably will do),"" Lay said. In addition, 
the capped formula ""invites generators to shut in production, export power 
out of state and deploy their turbines in other states or countries."" 

He noted that the ISO's Chairman voted against the measure while all of the 
state's utilities voted for it ""presumably knowing full well that it simply 
will not work."" 

California is ""just the latest failure of partial or compromised open 
access,"" said Lay. ""It's time for the Commission to reject this approach. 

""The power industry --- the nation's most essential industry --- is mired in 
the transition from regulated monopoly to open access and customer choice. 
Every step forward has been compromised out of concern for alienating one 
vested interest or another. As a result, utilities are free to slow the 
interconnection of new generation, withhold equal access to the transmission 
system, favor their own sales over those of competitors, miscalculated 
available transmission capacity, and exercise control over supposedly 
'independent' system operators and reliability organizations. 

Lay predicted that installing price caps for political expediency would 
""plunge markets into greater uncertainty and discourage new supplies and 
conservation methods..."" 

FERC has to complete the work that it started, said Lay. It has to ensure 
that all parties have equal and fair access to transmission by ""ending the 
special priority for utility uses of the system. Second, FERC must require 
transmission owners to separate operation of the monopoly transmission assets 
from their other businesses. Third, FERC must take politics out of 
transmission system operations by revising governance structures to ensure 
independence. Finally, FERC must end its reliance on shortsighted price caps 
by putting in place the necessary reforms to allow these markets to operate 
efficiently to encourage conservation and attract new supplies."" 

EPSA said the Cal-ISO board ""acted in obvious disregard for the Commission's 
orderly processes."" It ""cannot be permitted to make the Commission's 
decisions for it, or to alter so radically market rules, thereby injecting 
more uncertainty and confusion in the market and subverting the process for 
fashioning fair, effective and comprehensive remedies"" for California's 
""flawed"" electric markets, the group noted. 

The EPSA believes that any remedial actions taken by FERC with respect to the 
California markets will be ""severely compromised"" if the Cal-ISO board's 
imposition of new prices caps is allowed to take effect."

El Paso Energy Corp. is closer to acquiring PG&E Corp.'s Texas gathering and 
liquids businesses for about $840 million in stock and debt after signing a 
consent agreement earlier this week. The deal includes 8,500 miles of natural 
gas transmission pipelines that transport about 2.8 Bcf/d, nine processing 
plants that process 1.5 Bcf/d, and a 7.2 Bcf natural gas storage field. 

PG&E National Energy Group bought the properties about three years ago from 
Valero Energy and Teco for $1.02 billion, but had been unable to turn a 
profit. When it purchased the properties, PG&E paid a premium price to enter 
the west-east gas transportation market. However, since the sale, the basis 
between Waha in West Texas and Katy and the Houston Ship Channel has 
tightened and PG&E could not overcome the roadblocks to become a major 
player. 

The assets, which also include significant natural gas liquids pipelines and 
fractionation facilities, serve all of Texas' major metropolitan areas, large 
industrial load centers and several natural gas trading hubs. The book value 
before the sale to El Paso was estimated to be between $2.5 billion and $2.7 
billion. 

Before buying PG&E's assets, El Paso was already an experienced player in the 
liquids game. When the deal was first announced, El Paso said that 70% of the 
cash flow generated by the Texas assets came from stable fee-based activities 
with the balance from processing. El Paso, which is close to completing a 
merger with The Coastal Corp., expects to actively manage the risk on the 
non-fee-based side. 

As part of the normal review process, the consent agreement signed this week 
is subject to the approval of the Federal Trade Commission. El Paso also has 
to finalize a similar agreement with the State of Texas. Once the agreements 
are approved, El Paso Energy expects to close the transaction in the fourth 
quarter."

study.  

Gas Turbines Headed for a 50% Meltdown

High natural gas prices, performance issues and higher than expected 
maintenance costs, a general economic slowdown and several other key factors 
will combine to create a ""near-term meltdown in the gas turbine market,"" 
according to a report by WEFA, Inc. 

Reporting on a study about to be published by the analysis and consulting 
firm based in Eddystone, PA, one of its authors predicted ""a substantial 
short-term correction in the gas turbine market..which could render 50% of 
current North American projects uneconomic."" Jason Makansi, principal of 
Makansi & Co., pointed to other factors, such as the inexperience of many 
generating companies with the hedging and trading skills necessary to 
optimize profits in the peaking market, the rise of ""stealth capacity"" from 
refitted or otherwise optimized coal and nuclear plants, ""gas transportation 
bottlenecks and persistent issues with safety and explosions,"" and ""a 
protracted quasi-regulatory quagmire."" 

Under the heading of stealth capacity, ""old assets are being purchased or 
merged into new electric economy organizations that will improve capacity 
factors at coal-fired plants from the typical 60-65% to perhaps 80-85% within 
five years."" A major part of the gain will come simply from operating the 
assets to serve the market and not just a single service territory, Makansi 
said. He reported on the soon-to-be released study at WEFA's World Economic 
Conference last week in New York. 

The nuclear industry is experiencing a similar transformation. Several years 
ago predictions were that as much as one-third of nuclear plants would soon 
be retired. Today, with many units sold to new owners and re-licensed, it 
appears the retirement rate will be more like 5-10% and productivity for the 
remaining units will be increased. 

The WEFA report points to a ""technological correction"" for the advanced 
technology ""F-Class"" turbines going into most new plants today, as unexpected 
problems crop up with extended use. There are a host of problems in the 
technology area, which can be met, but at a cost: the new units may not meet 
emissions targets without impacting efficiency, heat rate and durability; 
fuel-switching is not living up to its advance billing; units may not perform 
as well at high ambient temperatures; overhauls are required more frequently 
than had been expected; maintenance costs also are exceeding expectations; 
and fuel quality is becoming an issue. 

""Variable O&M costs at some projects with F-class machines are running as 
high as $25,000 to $30,000 per start. Considering that some of these machines 
may exhibit several hundred starts in a year, you have a variation of that 
worn phrase, ""a start here, a start there, pretty soon you're talking about 
real money!"" 

""The bottom line of all this is that many of the claimed performance 
advantages of the gas turbine have been lost or severely eroded."" Makansi 
also pointed to similar experiences with gas turbines in the U.K., Asia, 
Australia, and Chile. He predicted a turbine market correction ""and an 
unavoidable plateau to work out technological kinks, modify designs and 
inject reality into business models. We believe all this will push 
consolidation in the generation sector of the electricity industry even 
faster."" Makansi predicted about half a dozen major players will control 50% 
of the generation capacity in the U.S. within five to 10 years. 

Co-authors of the report include Robert Swanekamp, a principal of Competitive 
Power Resources; engineering consultant Jeffrey J. Fassett; and Kemm Farney, 
vice president, WEFA Electric Power Service. For more information go to

Raymond James Sends Chills Up Gas Buyers' Spines

Raymond James and Associates gave gas buyers a Halloween shriek yesterday 
that could be producing chills all the way through next April, perhaps even 
all of next year. The firm released a chilly forecast of double digit gas 
prices this winter and said it expects prices to average $4.50/MMBtu in 2001. 

""Regardless of a potentially warm winter, it is highly likely that the United 
States will experience regional shortfalls in gas supply,"" Raymond James said 
in its latest energy report. ""In other words, gas storage should test 
all-time low levels this winter regardless of weather. 

""The situation should get worse, not better, next year. If we end the winter 
at all-time low storage levels and we cannot inject more gas next summer than 
we did this summer, then we should enter next winter with dangerously low 
levels of natural gas,"" Raymond James added. 

""We believe that the United States will see gas demand increase by about 9 
Bcf/d (or 15%) by the end of 2002 as new gas fired electric generation plants 
come on line. Unfortunately, even if every drilling rig is working, U.S. gas 
supply is likely to increase by less than 4 Bcf/d by the end of 2002. This 
means that gas prices must rise sufficiently to crimp over 5 Bcf/d of demand 
out of the gas supply/demand equation by 2002. At $5/Mcf, only about 1.5 
Bcf/d of demand has been reduced so far. That means that gas prices must go 
higher over the next several years."" 

However, Raymond James' bullish predictions are a far cry above the crowd on 
Wall Street. Plenty of other analysts have upped their forecasts recently to 
hair-raising levels. The First Call consensus for 2001 now is up to 
$3.85/MMBtu. But that's still 65 cents less than the Raymond James's 
prediction. 

Not everyone wants to scare the daylights out of buyers, however. Deutsche 
Bank believes analysts and the futures market participants at Nymex ""are 
getting bold and in our view maybe too bold."" 

""With the natural gas rig count approaching 850, it is hard to believe that 
there will not be a fairly substantial supply response in 2001,"" Deutsche 
Bank said in its Energy Wire on Friday. ""Analysts at the U.S. Energy 
Information Administration are expecting dry gas production to rise to 18.94 
Tcf (51.9 Bcf/d) in 2001, after being stuck at near 18.7 Tcf (51.2 Bcf/d) for 
several years. Our own estimate for 2001 looks for 19.1 Tcf (52.3 Bcf/d) and 
we have seen credible forecasts reaching as high as 19.7 Tcf (54 Bcf/d). In 
general we think the EIA is way too conservative and that our own number is 
more likely to be adjusted higher rather than lower. A gain in domestic 
production of 2 Bcf/d to 53.2 Bcf/d could be doable. Imports appear likely to 
be up 0.5 Bcf/d. If demand rises by 2.5%, that would account for about a 1.5 
Bcf/d gain. All other things equal, this implies that storage can refill and 
suggests that prices are going to come under some downward pressure."""

N. Border Plans Extension to Tap Powder River Basin

Powder River Basin gas producers may be about to get a more direct route to 
Midwest markets. Northern Border Pipeline has released plans to build a new 
325-mile greenfield pipeline from McCabe, MT, to Gillette, WY, to tap the 
rapidly growing production in the Powder River, which is estimated to hold 
between 10 and 30 Tcf of gas. 

The basin's rapid production growth has captured the attention of the 
industry, with numerous proposed pipelines, including several new interstate 
plans that would bring gas to the Midcontinent gas grid. Northern Border's 
project, called the Bison Pipeline, would add a new route out of the basin 
for between 375,000 and 500,000 MMBtu/d of production starting in November 
2003. The pipeline is holding an open season on the proposal through Dec. 5. 

Receipt points are proposed with Bighorn, Fort Union Gas Gathering, MIGC and 
Thunder Creek Gas Services. A bi-directional interconnect accessing Williston 
Basin Interstate Pipeline's Baker storage field also is proposed. 

The connection with Northern Border will provide Powder River producers with 
direct access to several local distribution companies, including 
Montana-Dakota, Alliant Interstate Power, MidAmerican Energy, Nicor Gas, 
People Gas and Nipsco. It also provides access to ANR Pipeline, Midwestern, 
NGPL, Northern and Vector. 

The projected recourse rate is 26 cents/Dth/d, but a negotiated 10-year 
demand rate cuts 4 cents off that. The pipeline is offering 
""mileage-sensitive rates,"" which are expected to allow a shipper to tailor 
supply access and optimize transportation value. 

Northern Border plans to hold a briefing on the project in Denver on Nov. 14. 
For more information, contact project director Paul Miller in Omaha, NB, at

,11/03/2000,,kevin.hyatt@enron.com,bullets@enron.com,,Bullets 11/3,"New Mexico Train De-railment - Most of this week was spent helping customers 
re-route gas as the train derailment on TW's right-of-way in McKinley County, 
New Mexico forced Operations to blow down the mainline in the east of Thoreau 
area.  The accident reduced flow to the California border by 250,000 MMBtu/d 
or 25%.  Once the 27 rail cars were removed, a determination was made that 
line would need to be hydro-tested to ensure no damage had occurred.  
Approximately 2000 feet of pipe was excavated, the coating inspected and/or 
replaced, and if test results are good, the line should be back in service 
sometime during the weekend of November 3.  While the pipe is being recoated, 
the line segment will only operate at 80% of maximum pressure.  TW costs and 
revenue losses are being tracked to enable us to recoup damages from 
Burlington and/or Enron business interruption insurance.

Sempra Trading - The loss of gas supply from TW's east end enabled us to sell 
a max rate IT agreement for 100,000 MMBtu/d to Sempra during this outage.  
Duke also moved 40,000 MMBtu/d of alternate volume west at max rates.

Transport Options Tariff - The deadline to file protests on TW's Transport 
Options Program was Monday October 30.  Twenty-two parties filed 
interventions, of which only three were protests: PG&E, SoCal/Sempra, and 
Dynegy.  We expect FERC to schedule a technical conference sometime in the 
next 30 days.

Non-binding Open Season - The solicitation was published and sent to 
customers this week asking for expressions of interest in capacity turnback 
or pipeline expansions across all of TW.  Responses are due November 17th."

Fitch Puts 2 CA Utilities on Negative Watch 

In the midst of the continuing uncertainty over regulatory treatment of 
growing wholesale electricity cost under-collections, Fitch Tuesday assigned 
a ""rating watch negative"" designation to the securities of California's two 
largest investor-owned utilities, Pacific Gas and Electric and Southern 
California Edison (and its parent company, Edison International). In 
addition, it lowered Edison's commercial paper rating one notch to ""F1"" from 
""F1+"". 

Fitch cited the need for ""significant and extensive regulatory decisions"" to 
resolve the continuing problem of retail utility electric rate 
under-collections plaguing both utilities. It indicated that with the ""watch 
negative"" status, the independent rating service expects to review the 
ratings within six months. 

A spokesperson for PG&E Corp., the parent of Pacific Gas and Electric, said 
the Fitch move doesn't lower any of its ratings, but it ""underscores the 
seriousness of the situation (in California) and the need for all the parties 
to come together for a collaborative solution."" The companies have asked for 
relief from the California Public Utilities Commission (see Daily GPI, Oct. 
30). Edison is the target of an investors' lawsuit which accuses it of 
illegally booking as revenue the wholesale power costs that have yet to be 
collected. (see Daily GPI, Nov. 1). 

The Fitch move had no effect on PG&E's latest utility debt line extension of 
$1.3 billion that was implemented recently in response to the continuing 
under-collections, the spokesperson said. Fitch reiterated that through 
September the two utilities had booked under-collections exceeding $5 billion 
collectively and that wholesale power prices continue to exceed the 
utilities' frozen retail rate levels. 

""While these amounts exceed immediate funding requirements, their recovery 
through rates is uncertain,"" Fitch stated in its announcement on the negative 
watch. ""Barring a change in regulatory policy, PG&E and SoCal Edison 
anticipate they will be unable to recover their under-collections before the 
end of the statutory rate freeze period ending March 31, 2002."

4"" side valve (formerly used for Highland - Pecos Irrigation,  POI # 500269; 
Sect. 10, T23S-R28E, Eddy Co., New Mexico Higland-Pecos Irrigation).  The 
former measuring facilities, the lateral, and the 8"" Crawford lateral were 
all sold to Duke.  TW measurement facilities do not exist at the interconnect 
that can be re-activated for EOG gas lift measurement/regulation.  Should EOG 
desire to receive lift gas from TW, then new measuring and regulating 
facilities will be required.  See Figure 1 below for connection details.

However, expected operating pressures available on the 16"" Crawford lateral 
is common to suction pressures observed at the suction of WT-1 Compressor 
Station that varies between 580 - 630 psig (see Figure 2, daily average 
pressure graph for May-Oct 2000).  As you indicated that EOG's line pressure 
would be near 650 psig, it will not be possible for TW to deliver into EOG 
unless they can lower their line pressure to about 550 psig or add 
compression.

,11/08/2000,,enron.announcements@enron.com,all.worldwide@enron.com,,Organizational Changes,"We are making a number of significant organizational changes.  These changes 
are intended to accomplish four key objectives:

First, we need to realign all our wholesale businesses around the successful 
business model developed over the last decade in North America and Europe.  
This model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built 
around a relatively small strategic asset position.

Second, we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting 
relationships.  Particularly with Joe Sutton,s departure, the ability to 
directly manage the day-to-day activities of 15 independent business units 
has become increasingly difficult.

Third, we need to accomplish these changes without, in any way, compromising 
the ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or 
hindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our lower-yielding 
asset positions.

And fourth, as always, we need to take advantage of the reorganization to 
redeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities.

ENRON WHOLESALE SERVICES

Today, we are forming Enron Wholesale Services (EWS) which will consolidate 
our global wholesale businesses.  The closer alignment of our wholesale 
businesses will accomplish the following: (1) enhanced communication and 
coordination across business units, (2) more rapid deployment of people to 
higher valued opportunities, (3) more effective prioritization of 
opportunities across the wholesale business, and (4) more rapid extension of 
Enron,s wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries and 
markets.

Enron Wholesale Services will include our current North American, European 
(including Japan and Australia), Global Markets, and Industrial Markets 
operations, and will be expanded to include Enron,s Net Works business unit 
as well as a new unit ) Enron Global Assets.  In addition, Enron,s merchant 
businesses outside of North America and Europe will be integrated into this 
new structure as described below.

Mark Frevert, currently Chairman of each of our wholesale units, will assume 
the role of Chairman and CEO of Enron Wholesale Services.  Greg Whalley, 
currently Chairman and CEO of Enron Net Works, will join Mark in the Office 
of the Chairman as President and Chief Operating Officer.

Providing further impetus for these organizational changes, several of our 
international business unit leaders have elected to move into new leadership 
positions:

Rebecca McDonald, currently CEO of Enron APACHI, will join EWS as President 
and CEO of Enron Global Assets. Enron Global Assets will have responsibility 
for managing all of Enron,s existing energy asset portfolio outside of North 
America and Europe.  Joining Rebecca in the Office of the Chairman as COO 
will be Jim Hughes, currently COO of Enron APACHI.  Rebecca and Jim will 
report to the EWS Office of the Chairman.

Sanjay Bhatnagar, currently CEO of Enron India, has joined EBS as CEO for the 
Middle East and Asia region.  Sanjay will be responsible for building our 
broadband business in this region and the current EBS team in this region 
will report to Sanjay.  In this role, Sanjay will report to the EBS office of 
the Chairman.  In addition, Sanjay will continue to remain responsible for 
Enron,s wholesale energy business in India and will transition this business 
into Enron Global Assets in the near future.
 
Diomedes Christodoulou, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, has joined 
EBS as Chief Commercial Officer.  Diomedes will be located in London and will 
focus his origination activities on global opportunities, with near term 
attention to the wholesale and enterprise sectors.  Diomedes will report to 
the EBS Office of the Chairman.

Jim Bannantine, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, will be joining EES 
to lead EES, commercial efforts outside North America and Europe.  In order 
to ensure a smooth transition for our South American businesses and to 
facilitate our asset sales activities, Jim will remain in South America for 
at least the next several months and continue to serve as CEO of Enron South 
America.  Throughout the transition, Jim will report to Cliff Baxter and to 
the Office of the Chairman of Enron Wholesale Services.  Following the 
transition, Jim will join EES.

In addition to these changes in our international asset operations 
activities, we are making the following changes in our merchant wholesale 
businesses and the commercial support functions:

Enron Net Works
Louise Kitchen will assume Greg,s previous responsibilities as President and 
CEO of Enron Net Works, reporting into Mark and Greg.  

Enron Americas
Concurrent with the transfer to Enron Global Assets of responsibility for 
operating Enron,s South and Central America asset base, all trading, 
marketing, and new asset development activities in these regions will report 
into a new entity, Enron Americas.  Enron Americas will have responsibility 
for all wholesale merchant businesses across North, Central and South 
America.  Dave Delainey, President and CEO, and John Lavorato, Chief 
Operating Officer will comprise the Office of the Chairman for Enron 
Americas.

Enron Europe
The Enron Europe organization, which includes Enron,s businesses in Australia 
and Japan, and Enron Metals, remains unchanged under the leadership of John 
Sherriff, President and CEO, and Michael Brown, Chief Operating Officer.

Enron Global Markets
Enron Global Markets, under the leadership of Mike McConnell, President and 
CEO, and Jeff Shankman, Chief Operating Officer, will continue to have 
responsibility for Enron,s Middle East and LNG operations.  With the 
exception of Ecoelectrica in Puerto Rico, all operating power plants and 
associated personnel in the Caribbean and Central America will transfer to 
Enron Global Assets.  Enron Global Markets will also continue to manage the 
commodity businesses in crude and products, coal, weather, insurance, 
equities, interest rates, foreign exchange, and agricultural products.

Enron Industrial Markets
Enron Industrial Markets, organization, under the leadership of Jeff McMahon, 
President & CEO, and Ray Bowen, Chief Operating Officer, remains unchanged.

Commercial Support for EWS
The commercial support functions for EWS will remain with, and be managed by, 
the individual business units.  We are creating no incremental overhead in 
the creation of EWS, and in fact hope to reduce our operating costs by more 
efficient utilization and sharing of resources across EWS.

To this end we have asked several people to take on an expanded role across 
EWS in addition to their ongoing roles within their business units.  These 
newly defined roles are as follows:

Mid and Back Office Operations ) Sally Beck will lead Mid and Back Office 
Operations across EWS.  These services will become part of Enron Net Works, 
with Sally reporting to Louise Kitchen and Rick Causey, Executive Vice 
President and Chief Accounting Officer.  This alignment creates a coordinated 
services organization with IT and e-commerce platforms to support the 
wholesale businesses and to maximize opportunities to commercialize these 
services.  Mid and Back Office services for all commercial activities will 
continue to be organized with dedicated operations controllers responsible 
for specific commodities and/or geographic locations.
Legal ) Mark Haedicke will serve in the role of General Counsel for EWS.
Regulatory and Government Affairs ) This function will remain organized on a 
regional basis.  Rick Shapiro will support all EWS businesses operating in 
the Americas, and Mark Schroeder, who is based in London, will support all 
European and Eastern Hemisphere operations.  Rick and Mark will also continue 
to support all other Enron businesses operating in their respective regions 
and will continue to report to Steve Kean, Executive Vice President and Chief 
of Staff.
Public Relations ) This function is also organized primarily on a regional 
basis.  Eric Thode will have responsibility for North American activity, 
Enron Net Works, and Enron Industrial Markets.  Jackie Gentle will continue 
in her role for Enron Europe (including Japan and Australia) and John Ambler 
will have responsibility for activity outside North America and Europe as 
well as providing support for Enron Global Markets and Enron Global Assets.  
These individuals will also continue to have a split reporting relationship 
to Mark Palmer, Vice President of Communications.
Business Analysis and Reporting ) Wes Colwell will expand his role to cover 
EWS reporting in addition to his current role in North America.

Attached for your review is an organization chart for Enron Wholesale 
Services which summarizes the changes described here.  As this organization 
continues to evolve we will keep you informed of any additional changes.

ENRON GLOBAL EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION
AND ENRON WIND

 As part of our company-wide initiative to examine our assets and investments 
around the world, we are considering a variety of options with respect to 
EGEP and EWC.  As a consequence, we are putting these businesses under Cliff 
Baxter,s direction.  Jeff Sherrick, CEO of EGEP, and Jim Noles, CEO of Enron 
Wind, will report to Cliff.

CORPORATE STAFF

 We are consolidating the corporate staff functions: Human Resources, 
Government Affairs, Public Relations/Communications and Administration.  In 
that regard, Cindy Olson, Executive Vice President of Human Resources and 
Community Relations, will report to Steve Kean, Executive Vice President and 
Chief of Staff.

COMMITTEE STRUCTURE

 In light of the increased leadership opportunities created by Enron,s 
growth, the Executive Committee will be expanded to include more of our 
business unit leaders.  The primary role of this committee will continue to 
be the communication of relevant information across Enron,s businesses and 
the coordination of activities across those businesses.  We will also be 
drawing on this group to lead company-wide initiatives such as the 
performance review process and evaluation and creation of new businesses.  
The Executive Committee membership is shown on the attached list.

 We are also forming a new committee ) the Enron Corporate Policy Committee.  
This group will be responsible for overall corporate policy, personnel 
management policy and corporate strategy.  The Enron Corporate Policy 
Committee membership is also shown on the attached list.

 We are confident that these changes will align our talent and our capital to 
our highest return opportunities.  Please join us in congratulating and 
supporting all of these individuals in their new roles."
,11/08/2000,,enron.announcements@enron.com,enron.operations@enron.com,,ETS Shuttle Plane Service,"With the realignment of ETS, we want to remind you of the procedures for 
booking company aircraft service.  As you probably know, one Enron plane has 
been designated for use by ETS for travel between Houston and Omaha and for 
other trips as approved by the vice presidents or us.  Of course, a key 
consideration for approval is the number of passengers, which generally is a 
minimum of 4 - 6, and/or the difficulty of reaching the destination(s) by 
commercial airlines.  The plane is booked on a first come, first served 
basis.  To encourage maximum utilization of the plane, a weekly schedule is 
published and distributed to ETS support team members each week.

Virginia O'Neill coordinates the plane schedule and will continue to do so 
for all trips originating from Omaha.  In addition, we have begun utilizing 
charter aircraft service for trips originating from Omaha within a mileage 
range of 700 - 800 miles.  The utilization of charters for these trips will 
reduce travel costs by eliminating deadhead costs.  Virginia will continue to 
coordinate charter trips from Omaha also.  Beginning today, Julie Armstrong 
will coordinate trips originating from Houston.  Julie and Virginia will work 
together to continue publishing the weekly plane schedule so that travelers 
can utilize the plane when available.   Please remember that company plane 
usage requires the approval of your vice president.  If employees are 
reserving individual available seats on a scheduled flight, vice presidential 
approval isn't required.

If space is available, personal travel for employees and their immediate 
families is permitted.  Imputed income for the cost of the flight will be 
included in the employee's W-2 form at the end of the year.  Please remember 
that personal travelers are always subject to being bumped up to departure 
time by business travelers and that the schedule is subject to frequent 
change.

Please have the following information available when contacting Julie or 
Virginia to book a flight:

 Date of travel & destination  
Lead passenger's name
Other passenger's names (generally need 4 - 6 passengers)
Departure & return times
Ground transportation requirements (if rental cars are required, 
please have the individual's American Express number or Emerald Isle number 
available).
 Purpose of the trip
 Coding if the trip is being charged to a work order

We will continue to monitor usage of the company plane to maximize its usage 
and provide needed private aircraft service for ETS.  In addition, we expect 
that, except for NBPL, the actual aircraft usage cost will be billed directly 
to the user's cost center in year 2001.  However, the billing details are 
still being worked out and will be communicated when finalized.  If you have 
questions or comments, you may contact either of us or Julie or Virginia."

Exploring yet another legal avenue, Pacific Gas and Electric Co. Wednesday 
filed in San Francisco's federal district court asking for a judicial ruling 
that will mandate that it can recover all of the nearly $3 billion in 
uncollected wholesale electricity costs that have been mounting since May 
when price spikes in Califonia's market left the state's major investor-owned 
utilities vulnerable because their retail power rates are frozen at 1996 
levels. 

The utility argued that the wholesale power costs are federally approved, 
therefore, it filed in federal court. Earlier in the fall, PG&E appealed to 
the California Supreme Court, asking to overturn a California Public 
Utilities Commission decision this summer that limits its ability to recover 
its wholesale costs, which it passes on to customers without adding a profit 
charge. 

""We're just keeping our legal options open,"" said a San Francsco-based 
utility spokesperson, noting that the utility also is attempting to protect 
its financial status, which was challenged Tuesday when Fitch placed it and 
another California utility on a ""rating negative watch."" 

State and federal officials all acknowledge as part of a series of ongoing 
investigations that California's current wholesale electricity market is 
broken and noncompetitive in its current state, said Roger Peters, senior 
vice president and general counsel for Pacific Gas and Electric. ""However, 
there has not yet been any concrete action by regulators to provide for 
recovery of the costs we have incurred to purchase the power our customers 
must have, either through refunds from power sellers who charged unfair 
prices, or through retail rates. These costs are continuing to grow."" 

Noting both the unfairness and unpopularity of the skyrocketing wholesale 
charges, PG&E's utility nevertheless said it has a legal right to recover the 
charges from its almost four million customers, and it reiterated five steps 
it has taken to ""increase supply, moderate customer demand, repair the broken 
wholesale market and provide stable, reasonable rates."""

Public Service Company of New Mexico and Western Resources said that both
companies' boards of directors approved an agreement under which PNM will
acquire the Western Resources electric utility operations in a tax-free,
stock-for-stock transaction. Under terms of the agreement, PNM and Western
Resources, whose utility operations consist of its KPL division and KGE
subsidiary, will both become subsidiaries of a new holding company to be n
named at a future date. Prior to the consummation of this combination, 
Western Resources will reorganize all of its non-utility assets, including
its 85% stake in Protection One and its 45% investment in ONEOK, into 
Westar Industries which will be spun off to its shareholders.

Based on PNM's average closing price over the last 10 days, the indicated
equity value of the transaction is approximately $1.503 billion, including
conversion of the Westar Industries obligation.  In addition, the new
holding company will assume approximately $2.939 billion of existing Western
Resources' debt, giving the transaction an aggregate enterprise value of
approximately $4.442 billion.  The new holding company will have a total
enterprise value of approximately $6.5 billion ($2.6 billion in equity; $3.9
billion in debt and preferred stock).  The transaction will be accounted for
as a purchase and is anticipated to be immediately accretive to PNM's
earnings per share and cash flow."

(400-500 MMBtu/d 
hitting the Chicago market).  It sounds like they have not yet been able to 
commission the
Aux Sable plant because of the trash gas they are still pushing through.  
Some predictors 
are saying the delay may get longer.

Alliance Service Delay Extended to End of November

Alliance Pipeline conceded yesterday that its commercial in-service date will 
have to be delayed for the third time, this time until the end of November, 
because of continued problems with debris in the pipe and trouble getting the 
enormously complex components of the system working in sync. The 1,900-mile 
project originally was supposed to be in service Oct. 1. 

""Normal commissioning activities are continuing and most of the debris has 
been removed from the line,"" says Alliance CEO Norm Gish. ""However, periodic 
reductions in the flow of test gas due to the debris have complicated the 
required integration with concurrent commissioning activities at the Aux 
Sable Liquid Products processing facility near Chicago."" A spokesman said the 
debris included ""bits of foam"" that came off equipment used to extract 
moisture following hydrostatic testing. 

The complexity of the Alliance Pipeline operations also has led some 
observers to predict a lengthy delay before commercial service. The pipeline 
has an immensely complicated system patented by Alliance engineers that is 
designed to transport gas liquids in a gas phase with the 1.325 Bcf/d of 
natural gas from British Columbia and northern Alberta through 1,900 miles of 
pipe to the Aux Sable liquids extraction plant near Chicago. The pipeline 
also incorporates a cutting edge electronic control system designed to allow 
the pipeline to be operated by a single pilot in a downtown Calgary control 
room. Alliance operators say they are actually operating three pipelines: a 
physical pipe, a paper pipe and an e-pipe, which brings all aspects of the 
operation together around the clock 365 days a year. ""It's a tremendously 
complicated system and all the parts are interdependent, for it to work, they 
all have to work together."" 

Regardless of the delay, however, Alliance already is flowing a large amount 
of gas into the Chicago market. ""At this point in our commissioning 
activities, the system is flowing at approximately 40 to 50% of capacity. We 
expect to continue increasing the volume of test gas and approaching our firm 
delivery capacity of 37.5 million cubic meters (1.325 Bcf) per day prior to 
the end of November."""
,11/10/2000,,kevin.hyatt@enron.com,bullets@enron.com,,TW Bullets 11/10,"Agave Energy - Agave purchased a seasonal winter transport agreement for 
7,000 MMBtu/d on the Atoka lateral through May 2001.  This effectively sells 
out the Atoka and actually bumped some gas Duke/GPM had been delivering to 
the pools for free.  Incremental revenue for this deal is $70,200.

EOG Resources - The new EOG well on the West Texas lateral has been connected 
to TW but we are waiting for them to install an EFM device before we allow 
the gas to flow.

Burlington Resources - The letter agreement amending the interconnect and 
operating contract for the Burlington Val Verde plant on the San Juan lateral 
was sent this week.  We will adjust the prior period and remaining 2000 
invoices once the contract is signed.

PNM Capacity - FERC issued a tolling order on our request for rehearing in 
the PNM capacity docket.  We had asked for rehearing of the order limiting 
TW's acquisition of capacity to summer-only months.  There is no deadline for 
the Commission to act on our request so we'll have to wait to see when it 
appears on the docket.

PG&E - Representatives visited TW's offices this week to discuss a number of 
things including western gas flows, storage, winter and summer peaking 
capability, and EDI interface possibilities.  In response to TW's request, 
Rod Boschee indicated they may increase their capacity to take TW gas from 
300,000 up to 400,000 MMBtu/d!!  They would like to implement this change 
before Thanksgiving (in time for bid week) but are waiting on some upper 
management approvals first.  To date, they have been very pleased with the 
efforts of TW personnel to clean up the various substances contaminating the 
PG&E line."

A 
consent agreement has been filed with the 
FTC and State of Texas Tennesse Pipeline as part of the normal review process 
prior to final approval for the PG&E Texas
assets formally owned by Valero and TECO.   Tennessee had a note in their 3rd

some of the PG&E Texas acquired properties in their MLP.  They also indicated 
they had put their Crystal Storage in the MLP.

El Paso to Sell Oasis Pipe Stake

El Paso Energy Corp. will sell its 35% stake in Oasis Pipe Line, a 1 Bcf/d 
line in Texas, according to a disclosure in a securities filing made last 
week. El Paso said that the sale, which was negotiated in October, would 
result in a $20 million loss. 

The 36-inch intrastate gas line runs 608 miles from the West Texas Waha 
market to the Katy hub outside of Houston. The pipeline provides a link 
between El Paso Natural Gas and Tennessee Gas Pipeline, and is the principal 
route for Permian Basin supplies to access the Houston Ship Channel. 

Oasis completed a substantial upgrade in 1998, installing 9,400 horsepower of 
compression, and new interconnects to increase deliveries to eastern markets. 

Dow Hydrocarbons and Aquila Energy, a unit of Utilicorp United, also own 
stakes in the line. Along with its 35% ownership, Aquila also has firm 
transport rights on 280,000 Mcf/d. 

Before El Paso's sale is complete, it still needs approvals from the Federal 
Trade Commission and the Texas Attorney General."

CERA Alert: Sent Fri, November 10, 2000

Title: Taking up the Slack
Author: N. American Gas Team
E-Mail Category: Alert
Product Line: North American Gas ,
URL: http://www.cera.com/cfm/track/eprofile.cfm?uU26&m15 ,

Alternative URL:

Cold weather in the Midwest and reduced storage
injections have taken up much of the temporary slack
that developed in the gas market during the warm
October. As expected, prices have responded quickly to
the cold, with the December futures contract price
advancing by over $0.75 per million British thermal
units (MMBtu) in the past week. As cold weather
develops, late winter supply availability is still
uncertain in CERA's view. For that reason, dual-fuel
markets must remain off of gas, and market fundamentals
support the recent price rebound, which places gas
prices again at a premium to resid.

CERA estimates that US working storage inventories as of
the end of October were approximately 2,746 billion
cubic feet (Bcf), an all-time low for that date by 64
Bcf (see table below). Storage injections of 36 Bcf for
the week ending November 3 were higher than a normal
weather pattern would indicate, but more normal weather
for the remainder of the month would result in
withdrawals averaging 3.5 Bcf per day during November.
This withdrawal rate is moderate by historical standards
but 2.5 Bcf per day higher than occurred in the past two
years (see table below). This pace of withdrawals places
inventories on a path toward an end-of-March minimum of
771 Bcf under normal winter weather conditions, only 13
Bcf above the previous all-time low.

This market remains tight. Although added supplies will
begin to help by the end of the winter, for now some
demand must still be priced out of the market in order
to preserve storage inventories.

although
as intimated in this press release, we might see a follow-on expansion notice 
for more volumes later.
My gut feeling is that they're waiting for more certainty regarding 
permitting/certification on a couple
of the Bakersfield area IPP projects first before proceeding with the second 
phase.  The good news is that an expansion on the order they're describing 
here should not materially affect the overall Western U.S. gas balance with 
over 6.0 Bcf/d being consumed in California alone.

Gas Daily 11-15-00
Kern River casts its lot with California expansion
Looking to accommodate demand for gas-fired generation in California, 
Williams has plans
under way to expand its Kern River Gas Transmission system. The company 
announced
yesterday that it would file an application with FERC to add an additional 
124,500 dth/d of
firm transportation capacity from Wyoming to California markets.
The proposal  called the California Expansion Project  would tap into 
increased production
in the Rocky Mountain basin. And the California Expansion could pave the way 
for a
second expansion of Kern River. According to a company release, Williams 
plans on holding
an open season later this year to gauge interest in additional capacity on 
the pipeline.
A combination of rapid growth and the development of new gas-fired power 
generation
facilities in California is fueling expansion of the system, said Kirk 
Morgan, director of business
development for Kern River and Northwest Pipeline. Kern River is 
well-positioned to
pursue an economically attractive expansion of its mainline.
The $80 million project proposal calls for adding three new compressor 
stations, as well
as boosting or retooling existing facilities in Wyoming and Utah. Williams 
also plans to upgrade
two meter stations. The project,s anticipated in-service date is May 1, 2002.
Back in August, Kern River held an open season to determine interest in firm 
year-round
gas transportation service in Nevada and California and to determine interest 
for capacity relinquishment
by existing shippers (GD 8/18). The pipeline landed a number of contracts 
providing
for delivery of Rockies supply into California.
According to Williams, demand for new capacity out of Wyoming is being driven 
by a
number of factors, including a shift in downstream markets for Canadian 
supply and strong
economic growth in Kern River,s market areas. Surging demand for gas-fired 
generation has
also played a role.
Morgan said a ramp-up in Rockies production coupled with demand for 
competitive transportation
promises a solid base for future expansion.  An expansion on Kern River in 
2003
could help bring that production to market, he said.
The 922-mile Kern River system delivers Rockies and Canadian supply to 
markets in California,

forced
divestiture of their utility based generating assets and using them to 
purchase
new IPP plants.  Allegheny (as reported recently) is looking at building a 
plant in the
Palo Verde area.  


Allegheny buys Enron plants
Allegheny Energy Supply, the unregulated
generation unit of Maryland-based Allegheny
Energy, showed further proof this week of its
aspirations to become a nationwide wholesale
power provider, buying gas-fired plants from
Enron that serve three regions.
Financial terms of the acquisition were not
disclosed, but Allegheny will take possession of
three peaking units developed by Enron North
America: the 546-MW Gleason plant in Gleason,
Tenn.; the 508-MW Wheatland plant in
Wheatland, Ind.; and the 656-MW Lincoln Energy
Center in Manhattan, Ill.
Allegheny has been building and buying
facilities in Pennsylvania but last month gave the
first signal of its broader aspirations, announcing
plans to build a 1,080-MW unit in Arizona.
The three plants being acquired from Enron
all were developed after the 1998 price spikes
in Midwest markets, which highlighted the lack
of flexible generation in the area. All three entered
commercial operation in June 2000.
Don Feenstra, vice president of new
projects at Allegheny Energy Supply, said the
acquisitions fit with the company,s broader goal
of doubling the original size of its generation fleet
(about 8,200 MW) in five years. The three Enron
plants total 1,710 MW, swelling Allegheny,s portfolio
to more than 12,000 MW. Once the first goal
is reached, Allegheny wants to increase its generation
holdings by another 50% in a second five-year
period.  Feenstra said the Enron plants all can be
converted to combined-cycle for use over ex-tended
periods."

Kern River Gas Transmission, a subsidiary of Williams, said it planned on 
filing an application yesterday with FERC to add 124,500 Dth/d of additional 
firm transportation capacity to its 922-mile pipeline system. The company 
said the California Expansion Project will not only provide additional 
natural gas capacity from Wyoming to markets in California, but also will 
provide an opportunity for Williams to offer significantly reduced rates for 
firm transportation based on the recent approval by FERC of Kern River's 
Extended Term Rate Program. 

""A combination of rapid growth and the development of new gas-fired power 
generation facilities in California is fueling expansion of the system,"" said 
Kirk Morgan, director of business development for Kern River and Northwest 
Pipeline. 

The project includes construction of three new compressor stations, an 
additional compressor at an existing facility in Wyoming, restaging a 
compressor in Utah, and upgrading two meter stations. Kern River said the $80 
million project is targeted to be complete by May 1, 2002. 

The company said demand for firm transportation on Kern River was driven by 
several factors: the diversion of Canadian gas supplies to markets in the 
Midwest from the Pacific region; increased production in the Rocky Mountain 
basin; strong economic growth in Kern River's market areas; and increased 
demand from gas-fired electric generation facilities. 

Williams said it anticipates holding an open season later this year to 
determine the level of market interest in a second expansion of the Kern 
River pipeline. ""The demand for competitively priced transportation to 
markets in Nevada and California continues to grow. At the same time, gas 
producers in the Rocky Mountain basin are stepping up production. An 
expansion on Kern River in 2003 could help bring that production to market,"" 
said Morgan."

days and will not be available Nov. 30.

Northwest noted that despite putting its system into entitlement and issuing 
a realignment OFO, primary scheduled volumes through Kemmerer (WY) Station 
remain greater than physical capacity. Therefore, starting today the pipeline 
is invoking a ""must-flow OFO"" provision of its tariff. Until further notice, 
shippers with primary corridor rights southbound through Kemmerer are 
required to flow up to 10% of their contract demand from receipt points north 
of Kemmerer to delivery points south of Kemmerer or take some other mutually 
agreeable action to alleviate the Kemmerer capacity problem. See the

Title: Midmonth Report: Early Warning

*********************************************************

After a warm October, the first cold weather this year
has provided an early warning of what winter could bring
for the gas market. Cold weather across much of the
great plains and a cold forecast for larger heating
markets in the Midwest and Northeast have driven a surge
in gas prices of more than $1.00 per million British
thermal units (MMBtu) over the past week. This rebound
in price highlighted the continued tightness of supply
and moved the price of gas back above that of residual
fuel oil, assuring that dual-fuel loads remain off of
gas. Supplies for the winter are not adequate to allow
most dual-fuel end users to burn gas. If this cold snap
extends through the remainder of November, a heavy
early-winter draw on storage could set the stage for
unprecedented high prices through the winter.

Though storage inventories have reached near the 2,750
billion cubic feet (Bcf) level, they remain at a record
low heading into the heating season, and even a normal
winter would reduce inventories to a near record or
record absolute low by spring. This supply tightness
places the gas price playing field in the broad
territory above the resid price (near $5.00 in the Gulf
Coast) and into a range potentially testing the next,
difficult level of demand resistance. This resistance
could come from switching to distillate oil, but low
distillate inventories and high distillate prices mean
that switching would require a gas price above $7.50 per
MMBtu, and any move to switch to distillate would likely
drive prices of both commodities higher. Rather, a
combination of some switching to resid in industrial
boilers and a shutdown of a few more price-sensitive end
users may be required. None of these measures comes
easily or cheaply, however, and they can be overwhelmed
by weather-driven swings in demand. As a result, as cold
weather settles in, CERA expects heightened price
volatility at levels above the price of resid and
extreme sensitivity in the market to weather and weather
forecasts. Under normal weather conditions, CERA expects
Henry Hub prices to average $5.70 during December (see
Table 1), which by itself would represent an all time
high for December. But even this estimate could prove
low. If the current cold snap extends through early
December, prices could easily climb into the $6.50-$7.00
per MMBtu range.

Gas Storage-The Record Low Maximum
CERA estimates that storage inventories reached a
maximum of 2,746 Bcf as of the end of October, a record
low for that month by 64 Bcf (see Table 2). Even this
level was reached only through a fortunate combination
of a lack of storms in the Gulf of Mexico and consistent
warmth through most of October. The withdrawal season is
likely to have begun this week, however, and in a strong
way. The cold weather now settling in is likely to
offset warmth early this month, increasing the
withdrawal rate this November to 3.5 Bcf per day on
average, well above the 1.0 Bcf per day average rate of
the past two years. By the end of this month, the US
inventory deficit is likely to have widened again, to
350 Bcf.

CERA estimates that normal December weather would
require storage withdrawals of approximately 17.0 Bcf
per day, which is above last year's rate of 16.6 Bcf per
day. This year, however, this withdrawal rate would
apply consistent pressure in the market through December
and beyond, as it would keep inventories on a path to
reach 756 Bcf by the end of March, just below the 1996
all-time end-of-March low of 758 Bcf. So long as
inventories remain on this path the pressure does not
end even with the end of winter, as a significant
increase in injections next year would be required for
inventories to reach even 2.6 trillion cubic feet (Tcf)
by next fall. Although the supply build will begin to
help by late winter, it is unlikely to be of the
magnitude required both to offset power generation
demand growth and to allow this increase in storage
injections to occur-unless demand continues to be priced
out of the market.

Demand-Keeping Warm
After last year's warm winter, CERA expects a strong
rebound in heating demand, and this week's weather and
forecast reinforce that expectation. Weather last winter
(November through March) was the warmest of the decade,
and there will be a significant rebound in heating
demand in the residential and commercial sectors as
weather returns toward normal this heating season.

Under normal weather conditions,
* Average heating demand through the winter would be 3.5
Bcf per day higher than last year's.

* Monthly average heating demand through the winter
would be 36.7 Bcf per day, peaking at 45.6 Bcf per day
in January.

* December heating demand would increase by 4.8 Bcf per
day relative to last December.

Weather 5 percent colder than normal could further
increase December demand by 1.8 Bcf per day relative to
normal weather; likewise, a 5 percent warmer-than-normal
scenario could decrease demand by 1.7 Bcf per day
relative to normal weather.

Fuel Switching
With natural gas markets this tight, there is
significant pressure for demand to be backed out of the
market. Residential and commercial demand is inelastic
to price in the short run, which leaves industrial
demand and power demand as the only relief valve for the
market. This winter we expect

* all plants capable of burning residual fuel oil as an
alternative to gas to do so

* a loss of 700 million cubic feet (MMcf) per day of
demand for power generation relative to last winter

* industrial consumers to switch the equivalent of 500
MMcf per day off of gas

* gas prices to act as a ceiling for residual fuel oil
prices, as much as resid will act as a floor for gas

For December CERA expects an overall demand increase of
4.5 Bcf per day relative to last December and a 14.4 Bcf
per day increase in demand relative to November, with
increasing heating load offset somewhat by fuel
switching.

Supply-The Rebound
The pressure from increasing demand and lower storage
inventories is intense, but US supply is beginning to
rebound. The recent steep decline in US lower-48
capacity is expected to reverse in late 2000, given the
soaring gas-related rig count.

* The success in reversing the decline in the Gulf of
Mexico is related to the combination of

- the ramp-up of the Hickory and Tanzanite subsalt
discoveries on the shelf, adding to the recent startup
of the Muni field; these fields could add over 0.5 Bcf
per day later in 2001

- the response of the shallow water to the strong
late 1999 turnaround in drilling activity

* Other important capacity additions are occurring in
the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, with 0.5 Bcf per day in
2000 and 2001, and onshore, led by the Bossier sand play
in Freestone County, Texas, the Barnett Shale play in
Wise County, Texas, and the Powder River Basin coal seam
play.

* Further increases in drilling are likely to slow. New
deep land rigs are under construction and shallow rigs
are being refurbished with cannibalized parts from older
rigs. Producers are experiencing delays in obtaining
rigs as the supply of quality rigs depletes and drilling
companies struggle to round out drilling crews.

Regional Markets-Wild Winter in the West
Extremely cold weather in the West has brought Rockies
prices close to parity with Henry Hub prices and
triggered early season spikes at Sumas in the north and
Topock in the south. Pipeline maintenance on El Paso is
exacerbating the regional demand pressure and has
contributed to Topock differentials of over $2.00 per
MMBtu. Tight pricing relationships to the Henry Hub in
the San Juan and Rocky Mountains should hold through
February, with significant widening in differentials as
heating loads decline.

Winter has arrived in earnest across North America, but
the start-up of firm transportation service on Alliance
is delayed once again, this time until December 1.
Nonetheless, flows on the pipeline are under way; CERA
estimates that flows during October averaged 450 MMcf
per day. During November that total should climb to 750
MMcf per day, despite the later published start date.
With or without Alliance flows, a weather-driven rebound
in midwestern demand relative to November and December
last year should keep prices in Chicago at a significant
premium to Henry Hub prices. In the Northeast,
differentials remain extremely strong and exposed to
spikes throughout the winter, despite greater flows into
the region from Atlantic Canada this year (see Table 3).

CERA's outlook by region follows:
* Rockies. Very cold weather within the region has
brought Rocky Mountain prices near parity with Henry Hub
prices. A break in the cold or a cold snap in the East
will likely widen the differentials, but strong heating
demand in the region will keep differentials within
about $0.25 per MMBtu below the Henry Hub price. CERA
expects a December average differential of $0.25 per
MMBtu; however, this differential is expected to show
significant volatility based on regional weather. A warm
week in the Rockies could still push differentials
toward $0.50 per MMBtu.

* San Juan. San Juan prices will continue to hold close
to Rockies prices through the winter, with significant
pipeline capacity between the two regions. Heating loads
in the Rockies will determine the San Juan to Henry Hub
differential, with extended cold weather in the Rockies
pulling both prices close to the Henry Hub price. CERA
expects the December differential in the San Juan Basin
to average $0.20 per MMBtu.
* Permian and Mid-Continent. Unlike prices within the
rest of the West, differentials between the Henry Hub
and the Mid-Continent and Permian Basins are likely to
trade within a relatively narrow range during the
winter, as supplies from those basins are pulled either
east or west, depending on regional weather. CERA
expects a Permian to Henry Hub differential of $0.11 per
MMBtu and a Mid-Continent differential of $0.08 per
MMBtu for December.
* Chicago. Alliance flows into the Chicago market are
now running close to 750 MMcf per day. However, the
onset of the heating season has offset those increased
flows and pushed Chicago differentials up to near $0.15
per MMBtu relative to the Henry Hub, despite delays in
the completion of the Vector pipeline. CERA expects the
strong pricing at Chicago to continue, and December
differentials should average $0.25 per MMBtu.

* Northeast markets. Assuming normal weather, we expect
to see December basis for New York relative to Henry Hub
at $1.03 per MMBtu. New England will likely see prices
$0.05-$0.15 higher, depending on the pipeline. Much of
this increased basis differential is caused by fuel
costs. For example, with a 9 percent retention rate from
the Gulf Coast into New England, last December would
have seen retention costs of approximately $0.22; at
$5.70, that same retention equates to $0.50. Despite
additional volumes of gas deliverable into the Northeast
from the Atlantic Canadian fields, there have been no
additional regional pipeline facilities to deliver this
gas to the local markets, and an additional 166,000
MMBtu per day of potential demand will compete for the
capacity. Because of this tightness, should this month's
weather be colder than normal, we could see severe
spikes in basis similar to those seen in January 2000.
These spikes could even exceed the highs seen in
January, depending on the severity of any cold snaps and
the extent to which new electric loads are realized.

Canadian Markets-Winter Begins
The colder-than-normal weather has increased demand in
western Canada but is only now being felt in the East.
Storage peaked in the West in early October at
approximately 225 Bcf below last year's level and 6 Bcf
below the five-year average. Even with modest
withdrawals since that time, storage inventories are
still estimated to be adequate to meet winter needs.
Easter Canadian storage has continued to grow, pushing
levels to over 245 Bcf, 11 Bcf above last year and well
above the five-year average. With the eastward movement
of the colder weather, withdrawals are likely to begin.
This higher level of eastern storage will be useful with
the expected reduction of flows on TransCanada.

The good news resulting from the cold is a more normal
""freeze-up,"" which bodes well for a longer winter
drilling season. Gas well completions are expected to
reach 8,500 for 2000 and will likely be even higher next
year.

Further Delays for Alliance?
The ""commercial"" in-service date for Alliance has been
delayed until December 1, the result of a combination of
problems with clearing the line, delays in the
completion of the Aux Sable liquids extraction plant,
the delay of Vector, and a lack of supply. The pipeline
has been flowing gas, however, with volumes building up
since September. It is estimated that flows for November
will average 750 MMcf per day. TransCanada has taken the
full brunt of the Alliance flows so far, with Northern
Border and PGT remaining strong. December should see
Alliance flows build to between 900 and 1,000 MMcf per
day, with modest reductions in flows on Northern Border
and PGT. Storage withdrawals will likely keep
TransCanada reductions close to 350 MMcf per day, year-
over-year, until Vector begins service to eastern
Canada.

High Prices: Strong Pull West
The high demand in the Pacific Northwest has also
provided strength for AECO. The AECO-Henry differential
has dropped to the high $0.30s and low $0.40s as a
result of this increased pull. For December, the
differential is expected to average $0.50 per MMBtu, for
a resulting AECO average of C$6.97 per gigajoule
(US$5.10 per MMBtu).

Expressing frustration but continuing its resolve, Texas-based Western Hub 
Properties is ironing out some ""technical issues"" of financing with 
California regulators and now expects to start construction in February on 
its delayed Lodi gas storage field in northern California. 

The merchant storage project will be operating by this time next year, said 
Western Hub's California-based manager, Jim Fossum, who added that with 
faster approvals, the project could have been in service during this summer's 
electricity generating crunch and the current gas and power shortages. 

Despite the regulatory struggle, he said the company still plans to go 
through with its other California storage project near Bakersfield and the 
natural gas hub called Wheeler Ridge. Western has acquired leases on the 
property it needs and will start more detailed engineering of the proposed 
site over the first three to six months of next year. The company intends to 
make a filing with state regulators in summer of 2001. 

In both the approved Lodi project (see Daily GPI, May 19) and the proposed 
Wheeler Ridge storage field, Western is not concerned about lining up 
customers, said Fossum. The projects are not contingent on contracts, he 
said. ""Now that we are a bona fide (certified plant) utility under the 
California Public Utilities Commission, we are getting some technical things 
worked out with the commission staff and nailing down the last small pieces 
of property, Fossum said. ""Everything is basically ready to go at Lodi"" 

""We have to file with them documents that verify certain aspects of the 
project's financing. We can't move ahead with the financing until the CPUC 
approves it. 

""If we had not encountered all of the roadblocks that we have had, we could 
have helped with the problems this last summer, and we could be helping with 
problems right now."" He added that the project would not be operational in 
time to have any impact on the upcoming summer electricity demand and 
corresponding heavy natural gas demand to fuel power plants. 

Lodi and the Wheeler Ridge storage project are being designed as 
high-deliverability storage facilities. Lodi will have about 9 Bcf of working 
capacity, building to 12 Bcf. Initially, Fossum said, Lodi should have about 
400 MMcf/d injection capability and 500 MMcf/d withdrawal. 

In the southern half of the state, Western for some time has been doing 
reservoir studies near Wheeler Ridge and now has a ""couple of reservoirs that 
we think might work,"" Fossum said. ""We're in the preliminary planning phase."" 

The Wheeler Ridge project would have an ultimate working capacity of 12 to 16 
Bcf and similar 500 MMcf/d deliverability at its peak. He said Western hopes 
to have something operational in the Wheeler Ridge area by the end of 2002."

Effective July 1, the Skill Based Pay structure will increase for the 
following Gas Pipeline and Gas Processing skill families:

Gas Pipeline Controls, Mechanical and Welding;
Gas Processing Instrumentation and Mechanical.

Attached are the Career Progression Charts for both Gas Pipeline and Gas 
Processing.

These increases make it possible for us to remain competitive with salaries 
paid by GPG,s peer companies.  Our Skill Based Pay structure targets the 
fiftieth percentile of our peer company market and our actual salary and 
total cash compensation continues to be in the top 10 percent.  

Once again this year, we are placing premiums on skill families that support 
the future direction of our industry.  A premium value is being placed on the 
Pipeline Controls and Processing Instrumentation skill families.  This 
premium provides an incentive to develop the skills of our current employees 
and to attract you to the controls skill family.  The premium is being placed 
on blocks 1 and 2.  We are also placing a premium on the Mechanical skill 
family as an incentive to attract and recruit skilled talent.  This premium 
is being added to the top-level mechanical block.  

In addition to these structure changes, other revisions to the SBP program 
will be effective July 1. These changes include: 

O&M Techs hired after July 1, 2000 will not be automatically moved into the 
Sr. O&M Tech category.  After attaining O&M Tech 2, the qualified employee is 
eligible to move into the Sr. O&M Tech category by responding to job postings 
to fill staffing vacancies. 

Training for developmental skills may now be company supported based on team 
needs.  Management approval is required.  Employees are not compensated for 
developmental skills.

The changes are also reflected in the 2000 SBP Program Administration Manual 
available to you through your regional director or the  GPG HR website.

Friona, TX on Monday, November 20th, on business.  Provided below are some  
items I would have mentioned in the Monday staff meeting:

Plains Farmer's Coop - To date, I have been able to collect approximately 
half of the $500,000 imbalance which Plains Coop owes TW.  I will be meeting 
Charles Hough in Friona (Friona is located 100 miles west of Amarillo) on 
Monday to discuss the payment plan for the remaining imbalance amount in 
additionaI to other general business matters.  I discussed my action plan 
with legal and credit and will request full payment by January 31, 2000, 
latest date.  Effective Febrary 1st,  TW will also include penalty payments 
with any future imbalance outside the +/- 10% tolerance level.  

Pogo Producing - I met recently with John Havard with Pogo. Pogo plans to 
spud a well in Eddy county which is an offset to the EOG operated well 
recently completed and in the process of being attached to TW.   Pogo's well 
will be spud in December with an expected 60 day drill & completion time.  
They have an optimistic expectation of the production being close to the EOG 
well - current initial production of 14 MMcf/d, and have plans for additional 
drilling in the field area.  

CIG - A conference call was held with CIG on Friday to discuss delivery 
performance issues of deliveries to the CIG/Tumbleweed point and the ability 
of them to increase their delivery capacity to Transwestern.    They 
explained that CIG is currently fully subscribed and operating at MAOP along 
the line which provides deliveries to Transwestern, El Paso, NNG and 
SPS/Nichols.  All shippers holding capacity along this line (capacity 200 
MMcf/d)  already have subscribed to long term contracts primarily to El Paso 
and SPS.   Currently they have no operational capability to provide any more 
incremental delivery capabilities to TW at Tumbleweed.  However, they have 
indicated a probable second Raton Expansion project will be announced March 
2001 and have suggested that looping of this southern line could be a 
possible outcome of the project which would provide incremental delivery 
capacity to Transwestern above the current 40 MMcf/d level.  I will be having 
additional discussions with CIG marketing individuals to determine who, 
besides  El Paso and Evergreen, are the primary existing shippers down the 
southern portion of CIG's system in order to potentially get them to realign 
their contract to Transwestern as a primary delivery point.   

Expedition of Contracting Process - Per Kevin's request, I provided him, and 
also discussed, several ideas which would streamline and improve the existing 
contract processing cycle.  The most important and critical recommendation 
was to revise the 3 year old ET&S Discounting Policy which Bill Cordes had 
established for both TW and Northern.  Obtaining approval of even a few 
simple changes I could recommend to the Policy (applicable only to 
Transwestern, not NNG) would have an immediate effect of simplying the 
Officer approval process and would expedite the turn-around time."

,11/21/2000,,enron.announcements@enron.com,all.downtown@enron.com,,Holiday Safety Reminder,"HOLIDAY SAFETY REMINDER

The holiday season can mean an increased risk of fires and a higher potential 
for criminal activity due to people taking advantage of convenient downtown 
shopping and because of the increased number of special events and office 
parties.  We would like to pass along a few safety and security tips from the 
City of Houston Fire Department and the Houston Police Department.

? Please do not prop open stairwell doors or doors to the freight elevators.  
This defeats security. 

? Use only artificial trees and greenery in decorating your office space. Do 
not place cut trees or greenery within the building. Cut trees become major 
fire hazards when they dry out.

? Office parties or the holiday mood may distract you.  Be alert for thieves 
who try to take advantage of the holiday season. Sometimes just having fewer 
people at work during the holidays creates an opening for thieves. If you see 
someone that does not appear to belong in your work area, immediately call 
the Enron Security Console at 713-853-5360.

? Keep your purse or wallet with you at all times or locked away in a drawer 
or closet.

? If you go shopping, invite a friend to go along. Try not to overload 
yourself with packages.  When you return, lock your gifts away in a safe 
place.

? Always be aware of your surroundings while in a public area. If things don,
t look right, follow your instincts and avoid going into the area.

? When waiting for a ride home after hours, remain inside the building near a 
card-reader door until you see your ride arrive. 

? If office parties are on company premises and involve alcoholic beverages 
or public invitees, call security at 713-853-5360.  Security will advise you 
as to company guidelines."

Edison Mission Energy, an Edison International company, is purchasing the
rights to the Sunrise Power Project from Texaco Power and Gasification. A
proposed power generation facility to be located in Kern County, Calif., the
project will bring both short- and long-term generation capacity to the
state, which is in dire need of new power generation.

The Sunrise Power Project will be completed in two phases. Phase 1 will
consist of a 320-MW, simple-cycle peaking facility scheduled to be in
service during the summer of 2001. Phase 2 will convert the peaking facility
to a 560-MW, combined-cycle operation with an in-service date of summer
2003.

Final regulatory approvals should be received shortly for Phase I of the
project. Edison Mission Energy plans to seek expedited permitting approval
for the Phase II expansion in line with the fast-track approvals process
recently enacted by the California legislature.

Edison Mission Energy specializes in the development, acquisition,

chance of success.  First, Mission Energy is already a huge player in the 
IPP/Cogen business in Kern County, and is regarded as fairly skilled at 
getting permits/authorizations through the system.  Their existing facilites 
on Texaco's leases currently produce over 1,000 MW of power.  Secondly, this 
project would sit smack dab in the middle of the Midway-Sunset field and is 
easily accessible off the West Side Lateral of Kern/Mojave's system.  As 
such, they are probably a prime candidate for either Phase I or Phase II of 
Kern River's expansion.  Also, realize that Texaco has a substantial amount 
of field area [associated oil] gas, so, depending on the structure of the 
Texaco - Mission Energy sales agreement, Mission probably has access to or 
call on this Texaco production (i.e., they have the perfect physical hedge).

Kern would seem to be the ""pipeline of choice"" here... particularly, when you 
consider the impact of the reduced rates under their proposed expansion.  
Without the direct connection into Kern County, TW would have a difficult 
time competing.   Also, keep an eye out for El Paso moving forward with 
commercial plans for the California leg of All American Pipeline.  A large 
end-use plant like this could be the basis for an ""En-Rate"" type transport

information we have gained on the pipeline
operational start up and background information.  Vector may still be ""iffy"" 
for Dec. 1.  

Fingers Crossed, Alliance, Vector Shoot for Dec. 1
 
Alliance Pipeline informed its shippers yesterday that all debris has been 
cleared from the pipe, all connections are up and running, and that 
commercial service will begin on Dec. 1. Commercial service originally was 
expected to begin on Oct. 1 but was delayed several times because of 
commissioning problems . 

""We've tested all of our connections and we've been flowing volumes [to 
Midwestern LDCs] up to about half [663 MMcf/d] of what the pipeline is 
capable of transporting,"" said Alliance spokesman Jack Crawford. 

""We are asking our shippers today to provide forecasts to us of what they 
expect to do in the first month. The last time we did this the forecasts we 
got suggested that we'd be running at about 1.325 Bcf on the first day."" 

One of the key questions remaining is whether Alliance's main downstream 
supply outlet, the 270-mile Vector Pipeline project, will be ready to go as 
well on Dec. 1. Vector had construction problems because of wet weather and 
also was forced to delay its start-up from Nov. 1.  The pipeline would 
transport 700 MMcf/d of gas initially from Joliet, IL, through Indiana and 
Michigan to Dawn, ON, but would be expanded to 1 Bcf/d next November. 

""The last I heard they were expecting to make [the deadline],"" said Crawford. 
""We actually tested our meter with them over the weekend and it's all up and 
running, but that might be a subsequent event if they have a problem. It's 
been a challenge for them to get going, but it looks like they are all ready 
to go."" 

A Vector spokesman confirmed that commissioning is going smoothly and 
operations appear to be on schedule for Dec. 1 start-up. ""Right now everybody 
still feels that Dec. 1 is doable,"" he said. ""You might want to touch base 
again next week and see how it looks, but right now it looks like we're 
getting things pretty well wrapped up. 

""The last place where we've been completing work has been up in the Milford 
and Highland Townships in Oakland County, MI. That's the area just before we 
go in the portion of the pipeline that we're leasing from Michigan 
Consolidated Gas Co. As of last Friday, they still hadn't reached that area 
with linepack [gas]."" 

Crawford said the Aux Sable liquids plant also is up and running, and 
previous pipeline coordination difficulties have been ironed out. ""They are 
still bringing it up to full scale. They are short both volume and heat 
content at the moment and that's by design. The pipeline is flowing at about 
half volume at the moment, and in addition to that we've been running lean 
test gas."" 

Farther upstream, Alliance still has one lateral, the Peace River Lateral, 
that will be delayed because of the impact of wet summer weather on 
construction. ""It will be up and running perhaps not by Dec. 1 but in a week 
or two. It's an eight and 10-inch line. It's relatively small,"" he said. 

Once the massive new pipeline is running smoothly, the next steps to be taken 
include potential connections with several proposed pipelines in and around 
Chicago, including potentially the Guardian, Horizon and Whitecap Energy 
projects. 

""We also looked at a couple of other receipt connections on the upstream 
side,"" said Crawford. ""We've obviously talked about a potential expansion in 
the future, but as we found out by talking to people it looks like the supply 
additions in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin have not been as brisk as 
we might have thought, probably because of the downturn in the oil price a 
couple of years ago. It's likely that an expansion would be delayed for a 
year or two or even three. 

""The best that I've been able to ascertain from talking to people is that our 
supply deliverability really has not increased very much in the last two to 
three years, and as a consequence at least in the short run the gas on our 
system will end up coming out of other systems."" 

He also mentioned that TransCanada is planning to take some of its capacity 
out of service, including retiring some older compressors and rewheeling 
others, in order to reduce the amount of excess pipeline capacity in the 
Canadian gas market."

Restructuring proceeding.  Essentially, it adopts the Interim Proposal with a 
few modifications.  The CPUC states that they are taking a ""cautious"" 
approach to deregulation in light of recent market events in both electricity 
and gas, and therefore, rejected the more robust reforms outlined in the 
Comprehensive Settlement.  The CS was offered by SoCal Gas and supported by 
many of the settlement parties, including Enron and Transwestern.

The good news is that, with respect to Hector Road, the maximum volume at 
Hector is limited to 50 MMcf/d, similar to the proposal made by the 
Comprehensive Settlement.  I've included the section from the PD that deals 
with this issue for your convenience.  The full document is also attached.

excerpt at at page 50 regarding Hector Road:

(1) Receipt Points/ Intrastate Transmission
As we have already discussed above, we now judge that intrastate transmission 
unbundling is not wise at this time for the SoCalGas system.  However, 
SoCalGas, intrastate transmission system can still be made more accessible 
and understandable to its users.
In R. 98-01-011, the record reflects dissatisfaction among customers and 
shippers with the lack of clarity on how SoCalGas schedules gas shipments 
through its windowing system, and SoCalGas, sole use of the Hector Road 
interconnection as a receipt point. (Exh. 8 in R. 98-01-011, pp. 29-31 
(Southern California Edison Company Market Conditions Report), (Panel Hearing 
Testimony of  Mr. Paul Carpenter, Southern California Edison, Tr. pp. 
931-932, Jan 25, 1999).) Our decision in D. 99-07-015 directed investigation 
into using the Hector Road interconnection, even on an interim basis, and the 
publication of SoCalGas, windowing criteria in tariffs.  SoCalGas filed 
Advice Letter 2837, which detailed its process of basing a maximum amount of 
gas scheduled for shipment through a receipt point on the prior day,s 
nominations, except at the first of the month.  Early in the instant 
proceeding, the ALJ held in abeyance active consideration of the windowing 
procedure tariff SoCalGas filed, pending the resolution we reach today.  
(Prehearing Conference of September 1, 1999, p. 34.)
We are approving on an interim basis the replacement of the current windowing 
process with a system under which SoCalGas will establish receipt point 
capacities, subject to daily revision, on the basis of the physical maximums 
for each receipt point under the operating conditions expected for that day.  
Customers and shippers will know the daily maximums because they will be 
posted on SoCalGas, GasSelect system daily prior to the nomination 
deadlines.  If, in the aggregate, customers nominate more than the physical 
capacity at any receipt point, gas will be scheduled based on the upstream 
pipeline,s capacity rights system.  For Wheeler Ridge, at which more than one 
upstream pipeline delivers gas, the maximum daily physical capacity would be 
allocated between upstream sources pro rata on the basis of the prior day,s 
scheduled deliveries from each source.
This system eliminates the mystery in how pro-rations are made, provides 
continuity in capacity rights between the interstate and intrastate systems 
and provides flexibility for customers in nominating at the most 
cost-effective receipt point on any given day.  We recognize that it does not 
provide for long-term planning, but the alternative under the CS of paid-for 
firm receipt point rights for the term of the settlement has the disadvantage 
of locking customers into a receipt point that may lose value over the term.  
In this period of gas price volatility, we believe that the more flexible 
plan is the right one.
Thus, we direct SoCalGas to withdraw Advice Letter 2837 and file a new advice 
letter within 10 business days implementing the proposed receipt point 
physical capacity system.  This may be the same as the exemplary tariff filed 
with the IS or updated as necessary pursuant to subsequent proceedings.  This 
tariff revision will be effective within 30 days after the filing unless 
rejected by the Energy Division.
In R.98-01-011, PG&E and Edison particularly complained about the 
restrictions at Wheeler Ridge. (Exh. 15 in R. 98-01-11, pp. 7-9 (PG&E 
Rebuttal to Market Conditions Report), and Exh.8 in R. 98-01-011, pp. 29-31, 
(Southern California Edison, Market Conditions Report).) One response in the 
IS to these complaints is the establishment of a formal receipt point at 
Hector Road for all customers, subject to Wheeler Ridge access fees and 
surcharges.  Its capacity will be 50 MMcfd or greater as long as there are 
nominations of that volume and Mojave Pipeline Company delivers that much in 
response to those nominations.  This provision should allow greater 
flexibility for shippers and customers as well as leveling the playing field 
between SoCalGas and others at this interconnection.  We will support 
SoCalGas, application to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for 
approval of Hector Road as a formal delivery point by Mojave.
El Paso Natural Gas Company objected strongly to the provision in the IS for 
automatically expanding of Wheeler Ridge capacity  While this was not an 
option specifically mentioned in D.99-07-015, we do not choose to stand on 
that technicality to exclude it from consideration here.  Once a proceeding 
is open to settlement, the dynamics of settlement talks may bring in matters 
outside the delineated scope, as they have done here with regard to Wheeler 
Ridge expansion and, for instance, pooling.  Both proposals respond to 
concerns raised in R.98-01-011, (see citations in text above as well as Panel 
Hearing Testimony of Mr. Benjamin C. Campbell, PG&E, Tr. pp. 267-268, Jan 19, 
1999)) and neither was specifically excluded from further consideration in 
D.99-07-015.  We therefore view them as within the scope of this proceeding.  
To the extent that other receipt points are also viewed as constrained, we 
welcome evidence to that effect in a future proceeding, as well as proposals 
for criteria to determine when expansion should be applied for.  by 100MMcfd 
if a certain number of curtailments occurred, and for automatically allowing 
the expenses of that expansion to be rolled into rates.  We do not wish to 
approve automatic rate increases for all ratepayers for a facility for which 
only some may have use, but we believe that developing criteria for expansion 
of receipt points is useful.  Hector Road may not entirely alleviate the 
problem of constraints on northern gas flowing to the south.
Therefore, we approve that portion of Section III of the IS that sets forth 
criteria for expansion, but provide that upon the meeting of that criteria, 
SoCalGas shall submit an application for an expansion of the receipt point 
capacity.  That application shall be processed in the regular way, with the 
issues of need in the context of the entire system and foreseeable market 
conditions considered.  Moreover,  rolled-in or incremental rates, allocation 
of cost among classes and consequent rate design will remain open for 
decision in that proceeding.
Thus, the modification to the IS that we make is in the first sentence of the 
first full paragraph on page 8.  The words &apply to8 should be inserted 
after &SoCalGas will8.  We specifically disapprove the IS language in the 
middle on page 8 beginning with the words &This Settlement8 through the end 
of the paragraph, and the concomitant language in Appendix A setting the cost 
at $12 million in 1999 dollars."

Gas Daily

No quick fix for soaring California gas prices
In the past year, gas prices in most regions have doubled and in some cases 
tripled.  But no
region has seen the breadth of the price blowout now under way in the West.
While Henry Hub futures on the NYMEX appear to be leading the way for higher 
winter
prices nationally, most industry professionals are watching in amazement at 
the fundamentals-driven
price surge centered in the Pacific Northwest and California.

The cost of gas in Southern California has been skyrocketing.  Prices last 
week started
trading in the $7-$7.50 range and by Wednesday were trading $14-$18.
The cost of gas entering into the Northwest region of California via the N.W. 
Sumas,
PG&E Citygate, and Malin interconnections also soared to incredible heights, 
some pricing
nearing $20/mmBtu.

The most obvious cause of the dramatic escalation is scarcity of gas.  The 
bullish fundamentals
in California include heavier-than-normal heating loads due to uncommonly 
cold temperatures,
planned and unplanned nuclear plant outages that substantially increased 
demand
for gas-generated power, depletion of storage in Southern California and 
transmission constraints on regional pipelines.

Improving deliverability into Southern California is key to bringing the 
market back into
balance, said one trader, noting constraint-causing problems that have 
plagued pipelines serving
the region, including Kern River Gas Transmission, El Paso Natural Gas and 
Transwestern
Pipeline.

Those problems had come to a head in part because of high summer prices that 
helped
drain storage in Southern California and discouraged refill before the 
winter, he said.  Now,
unseasonably cold weather has hit the region, amplifying market needs to meet 
heating loads
and produce power. Add growing and competing markets in the desert Southwest 
and Northern
California and you have a crisis.

&It shows that when you get all the stars aligned, there is not enough gas to 
meet demand,8
he said.  At most, only 15%-20% of California,s supply of gas comes from 
in-state producers, with
the other 80%-85% coming from out-of-state, said Bill Woods with the 
California Energy
Commission.  Roughly 60% comes from the Southwest, 15%-20% comes from Canada, 
and the rest is
Rocky Mountain supply.

&At the moment, there is a lot of gas being purchased out of Canada.  But 
because of
imposed restrictions and other flow transmission problems, prices are 
soaring,8 he said.
At the moment, a lot of the new gas production in the Southern California 
area is mainly a
byproduct of oil exploration and production * so any new natural gas 
production will be
associated with what the demand for oil is, he said.
A majority of the &dry gas8 producers are located in the northern part of the 
state, which
until recently, was primarily a captive market of Pacific Gas & Electric.  
But new production
efforts are under way, he said.

&I definitely think that there needs to be some additional action taken to 
enhance our own
in-state production efforts, but there are a lot of bureaucratic hurdles to 
contend with before a
company can just go in and start drilling,8 he said.
&Hopefully, once the cold weather comes off, and our electricity loads start 
moderating,
I think pricing will adjust respectively. But until then, I guess we have no 
choice but to
deal with it.8"

Southwest Gas Corporation and Sempra.  The provided timelines provide an 
example of the various factors which impact the turn-around time of a 
Shipper's request for service and the actual activation of a new or amended 
transportation service.

Kevin Hyatt has received a flow chart of all the processes of acquiring an 
executed contract from the point of contract negotiation to actual executing 
by shipper - a 10 step process.  Our group can certainly discuss options to 
expedite this process. 

Sempra

6/9  Sempra negotiates right to call upon TW Permian to Needles capacity.
  Sempra understands they need to submit formal request for transportation 
  for new service.
6/12  Stephanie Katz indicates she want the remaining 1,500 Dth/d of Needles 
  capacity.  Has not yet provided TW request for the ""call"" capacity.
6/20  Stephanie and TK negotiate rate for the 1,500.  Does not provide TW
  request for Transportation.
6/21  Sempra provides request for transportation for the 23,000 Dth/d of 
  capacity, but specifically asks TW to WAIT to process untill they
  determine their supply side receipt point allocation.  CS attempts to
  relay to Sempra the ""alternate rights"" which the discount letter will 
  contain as a heads-up.  Stephanie thinks she may want other
  flexibility (California Border alternates) and tells me to WAIT untill
  she thinks about it.
6/26  CS calls Sempra to remind them time is ticking.  Sempra finally 
remembers
  to lock up supply side of deal. Promises to call me TOMORROW.
6/27  Sempra leaves a message at 4:30 P.M with receipt point allocations. 
6/28   CS asks Stephanie if she plans to negotiate with Jeff for additional
   alternates like she had considered, she says no.  Now that TW finally 
  has received a complete request for transporation Contract Admin
  generates the contract with a 2-hour period.
    CS immediately routes mutually agreed upon discount letter to officers
   for approval.
6/29  Request made as to reason for delay of contract tendering to Sempra. 



Southwest Gas Corporation

5/25  Receive SWG request for transportation service.  CS begins to draft
  discount letter with SWG, specifically confirms all provisions of contract
  with account manager.
5/31  Contract received from Contract Administration.
6/5  CS received all Officer approvals for discount letter except Bill Cordes.
6/6  CS hunts down Bill Cordes for final officer approval.  Receives Approval.

  CS faxes Larry Black on 6/6 Transwestern's OFFICER APPROVED 
  contract and discount letter .
  CS leaves Larry Black a voice-mail indicating contract is out.
  CS leaves Lorraine message indicating contract was sent.

6/9  Lorraine receives ""follow-up"" changes from May Kay to discount letter.
  Refaxes Larry Black revised letter .
6/12  CS receives another ""follow-up"" change from May Kay to discount letter.
  Refaxes Larry Black another revised letter.
6/13  Larry Black calls me indicating there are accidentally two #2 
paragraphs on the
  letter.  I renumber the paragraghs and refax letter.

being subject to a contractual OFO upon extending its contract term. However, 
citing ""the current OFO situation on the pipeline system,"" Northwest said 
last week the policy change is under review and has been suspended until

El Paso reported Thursday an injection unit at its Washington Ranch storage

Factors Leading to Higher Natural Gas Prices this Winter

? Demand for natural gas has increased mainly due to consumption in the power 
generation market and strength of the manufacturing sector in a booming 
economy.

? Natural gas production and drilling has fallen off since 1998 due to low 
prices that reached far below $2 per MMBtu.  In 2000, deliverability 
utilization will be over 95 percent.

? While drilling activity has risen sharply (as much as 50% from last year), 
the production from this increased drilling activity typically is not 
available for several months.  According to the AGA, supply production 
continues to run 16% below last year's levels.

? The past three winters have been ""warmer than normal"" winters in the 
Midwest and much of the United States and Canada, artificially masking the 
usual consumption of natural gas under ""normal"" weather situations. 

? Very warm weather during this summer has caused a significant demand 
increase for natural gas in the electricity generation sector thereby 
competing for gas storage injections in the marketplace and driving prices 
upward.

? U.S. storage inventory levels are lower than historical average levels from 
the past six years, according to the AGA.  The cost of storage inventory at 
this summer's strong prices could eliminate the price advantage traditionally 
experienced in the winter.

? Other heating fuels like propane and heating oil are also showing 
significantly higher prices and potentially lower stocks this winter than 
last."

Projecting that linepack would slip below its minimum target level through 
Thursday, Pacific Gas & Electric issued a systemwide Stage 3 OFO, effective 
today until further notice. The order carries penalties of $5/Dth for 
negative daily imbalances exceeding a 3% tolerance. 

As a result of warmer area weather and banking on its system, Northwest said 
it is operationally feasible to loosen conditions of its entitlement for 
delivery points north of Kemmerer (WY) Station. A Declared Stage II (8% 
tolerance) Overrun Entitlement will take effect today; through Tuesday the 
pipeline was in a Stage I (3%) Entitlement. A shipper is subject to penalties 
for overtakes north of Kemmerer that exceed an amount 8% greater than its 
confirmed nominations. 

El Paso will take the B turbine at Cornudas Station in West Texas down for 
maintenance today and Thursday, reducing South Mainline capacity there by 60 
MMcf/d. However, Cornudas capacity has not been fully utilized recently, the 
pipeline said, so this reduction should not affect current markets. 

The Kinder Morgan pipeline group (NGPL, Kinder Morgan Interstate, 
Trailblazer, Canyon Creek, KN Wattenburg and TransColorado) reminded shippers 
it has a new 24-hour hotline phone number for information and questions about 
point confirmations and related issues: (713) 369-9683. The old hotline will 
stay in service through Dec. 31, but callers will hear a recording giving the

Bilas draft cautious toward SoCal competition
Mindful of the current chaos over energy markets in the state, California 
Public Utilities
Commissioner Richard Bilas has recommended the adoption of a much more 
moderate
approach to promoting competition on Southern California Gas, (SoCal) system.
In his draft decision, Bilas advised the commission to reject the unbundling 
of intrastate
transmission and instead approve the first settlement filed in the case, the 
less far-reaching
Interim Settlement (IS), submitted in December 1999. SoCal, San Diego Gas and 
Electric and
other parties filed two more settlements after the IS, reaching a 
comprehensive agreement in
April this year.

But since then, gas and power prices skyrocketed in the state, prompting a 
consumer
backlash and giving competition a bad name.  The draft language notes that 
the first interim
settlement was supported by more customer groups than the later agreements.
Recent events &lead us to conclude that the centerpiece of this 
investigation, the unbundling
of intrastate transmission and the implementation of a system of firm, 
tradable intrastate transmission rights, should be delayed,8 according to the 
draft order.  &This unbundling is the basis of the [comprehensive settlement] 
and we cannot approve it. We do not, however, wish to commit to paralysis 
until 2006, as the [post-interim settlement] would have us do. Accordingly, 
we believe Californians are better served at this juncture by the adoption, 
with modifications, of the IS.8

The biggest change to the IS in the draft is the rejection of an automatic 
capacity expansion
by SoCal at Wheeler Ridge, Calif., with rolled-in rates if certain criteria 
are met.  El Paso
Energy had objected to the provision in the IS that would have allowed SoCal 
to automatically
expand capacity at Wheeler Ridge by 100 million cfd if a certain number of 
curtailments oc-curred.  
El Paso objected to forcing all shippers to pay for the expansion at Wheeler 
when only certain customers would benefit.  
The draft says SoCal can file a separate application for the Wheeler Ridge 
expansion, but approval would be conditioned on a traditional hearing process.

The draft decision would also:
 End SoCal,s current &windowing8 process, which limits shippers, ability to 
change nominations
for deliveries between receipt points on the system. It is replaced with an 
announced
daily calculation of capacity available at each receipt point;
 Establish Hector Road as a formal receipt point for nominations;
 Institute an operational flow order (OFO) procedure. Provides a forum for 
more changes
in OFO procedures if excessive OFOs are made;
 Set up &pools8 of gas on the SoCal transmission system that are intended to 
increase the
liquidity of gas trading;
 Make changes to balancing rules, while retaining the current 10% monthly 
imbalance
tolerance;
 Make SoCal,s own gas acquisition unit subject to the same balancing rules 
and penalties
as all other shippers;
 Allow some limited imbalances trading, as well as the right to assign and 
reassign unbundled
storage contract in a secondary market, with a SoCal electronic bulletin 
board set up
for it;
 Unbundle from core transportation rates the storage capacity cost exceeding 
that required
for core minimum reliability; and
 Provide for rate recovery of up to $3.5 million in implementation costs.

In addition, the draft would unbundle core interstate transportation from 
rates, eliminate
core contribution to noncore interstate transition cost surcharges, eliminate 
the core subscription
option as well as the caps for core aggregation programs.  The threshold for 
participating in
core aggregation is reduced, and billing options are offered to core 
aggregators.

Bilas, draft also warned that the commission may come back in two years to 
open another
investigation into gas competition, taking into account any changes in market 
conditions.
Bilas gave a little more insight into his decision in the text of the draft.
&The cost of gas as a commodity has vastly increased at the border, showing a 
differential
between the basin and border prices that is more than the cost of transport 
and related services;
we question whether there will be an opportunity for discounting by marketers 
if more competition is allowed,8 
Bilas wrote in the draft decision.  &With half the state already committed to 
a
restructured competitive natural gas industry, it suddenly seems as if the 
benefits of such re-
structuring to enhance competition are speculative, particularly at this 
time.  With one leg in the
water, the current has switched direction and it will be difficult, if not 
foolhardy, to reach our
goals by forging ahead.

&We choose to take a cautious approach again,8 the draft continues. &Rather 
than proceeding
to unbundle transmission in Southern California now, we approve, with 
modifications, the settle-
ment suggesting smaller steps towards a competitive market. Additionally, we 
unbundle core
interstate transmission and once again urge the Legislature to pass consumer 
protection legisla-
tion aimed at unregulated marketers while we facilitate growth in core 
aggregation programs.8
The CPUC would not rule out the unbundling of intrastate transmission and 
other restruc-
turing in the future &but believe that at this point in time the certain 
benefits do not outweigh
the costs to most ratepayers.8

All drafts must be filed 30 days before the meetings at which they will be 
discussed. The
draft decision is currently on the agenda for the CPUC,s Dec. 21 meeting."

Louis for the first time.  MRT (a Reliant pipeline)
has been the only pipeline into this market.  


NGPL Plans Lateral to Serve Illinois Power in St. Louis

Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America (NGPL) announced plans to build a new 
47-mile, 24-inch diameter pipeline lateral into St. Louis to serve Illinois 
Power's gas distribution system. The $35 million project, which is anchored 
by a contract with Illinois Power affiliate Dynegy Marketing and Trade, will 
add at least 300,000 Dth/d of gas transportation capacity to the St. Louis 
market. 

""The pipeline project and related agreements ideally demonstrate our ongoing 
strategy to expand our natural gas pipeline services into growing markets 
currently not connected to NGPL and to increase throughput on our system by 
adding electric load to our extensive pipeline network,"" said Richard D. 
Kinder, CEO of Kinder Morgan Inc., the parent company of NGPL. 

The new lateral will extend from Centralia, IL, to a point on Illinois 
Power's gas distribution system in the East St. Louis market. The project is 
scheduled for completion in June of 2002. 

NGPL and Dynegy entered into a number of long-term, gas transportation and 
storage contracts, including a 10-year agreement effective June 1, 2002, 
which will provide Dynegy with 90,000 Dth/d of gas via the new pipeline. In 
addition, NGPL and Dynegy entered into various other firm transportation 
agreements totaling another 98,000 Dth/d of gas sourced from NGPL's Gulf 
Coast and Amarillo lines beginning as early as Dec. 1, 2000. 

The NGPL project effectively creates a new supplier for a geographical area 
that until now has been served by just one natural gas transportation company 
[Mississippi River Transmission], according to Larry F. Altenbaumer, 
president of Illinois Power. ""This new connection to Illinois Power's system 
will help open competitive opportunities to natural gas customers in the 
metro east area of St. Louis. It not only provides for a new delivery point 
to service customers directly, but also to fuel electric generation in the 
area. 

""The 10-year agreement to provide firm transportation service to Dynegy 
provides us a solid anchor customer for the pipeline project,"" said Deb 
Macdonald, president of NGPL. NGPL intends to solicit expressions of interest 
from other shippers in December and January. The results of the open season 
will determine the final scope of the project. 

""With Dynegy as our anchor customer, we will build the new lateral into the 
St. Louis market regardless of whether we receive other expressions of 
interest,"" said Macdonald. ""We anticipate a strong response, however, given 
the size of the market and the potential for additional gas-fired power 
generation."" 

Interested shippers should contact Mark Menis, NGPL's director of business 
development, at (630) 691-3347."

To prosper in the new energy economy, Enron COO Jeffrey K. Skilling says oil 
and gas companies need to trash their traditional business models and instead 
reshape themselves to resemble Toyota when it captured the imagination and 
pocketbook of U.S. consumers 30 years ago. 

In a somewhat back-to-the-future treatise on how Enron expects to continue 
its monumental success, Skilling told Arthur Andersen Energy Conference 
attendees to define themselves not by their industry, but rather by their 
skills base. Toyota changed the U.S. auto industry by outsourcing its 
production, offering customers exactly what they wanted cheaper and faster. 
The energy industry has to do the same thing into the future, he told the 
Houston audience. 

""In 1982, the energy industry was a very rigid industry,"" he said, pointing 
to a similar business model that had been used by General Motors and Ford 
Motor Co. Those companies did every bit of the manufacturing process, keeping 
all of its pieces within the corporate structure. Then Toyota turned things 
upside down. 

When a customer wanted a different radio, Toyota relied on outside producers. 
It didn't stop the production line to please the customer. And it was able to 
do it faster. Enron has used the same model to shape its achievements, 
packaging components for customers to save time and money. Other energy 
companies are now adopting that method. 

In many ways, Skilling said Enron views itself as the Toyota of the energy 
industry. ""We don't feel we have to provide all components, but package them 
the way the customer wants them. This is a pervasive trend we are seeing all 
over the industry."" 

Enron, which has had a shareholder return of 1,333% in 10 years (January 1990 
to November 2000), saw the changes required by new technology and 
deregulation and redefined its core competencies, which grew from its 
pipeline business. Skilling said to remain successful, the Houston-based 
corporation plans to continue to morph. 

""It all hinges on one good idea Enron had in the 1980s, that vertically 
integrated structures had dominated our industry and the structures were 
starting to break up. In the energy industry, the reason was deregulation. 
Fundamentally, this is a better business structure for two reasons: you can 
be supplied with cheaper cost components and it allows you to change much 
more quickly."" 

Instead of bigger energy companies, Skilling said he expects to see many 
smaller companies, ""maybe thousands tied together electronically and 
vertically."" The transformation and interaction costs are ""collapsing across 
the economy."" As an example of interaction costs, Skilling used bank tellers. 
In 1985, it cost a bank $1.50 a transaction. To bank on the Internet today, 
it costs a bank less than a penny. 

This drop in interaction costs is a major reason Enron finds the bandwidth 
market so attractive. In 1995, the length of time to provision bandwidth was 
six to eight months. Today, it's two to three months. And next year, Skilling 
predicts it will take one second. 

""We will have bandwidth on demand by next year,"" he said, and added that 
Enron plans to be the leader in the field. 

Similarly, long-term gas contracts in 1982 took two to three years to 
execute. In 1989, they took nine months. Three years ago, they took two weeks 
to execute. Today, using EnronOnline and other similar Internet trading 
systems, it takes less than one second. 

""All of the sudden the world has changed. We have the same manufacture cost, 
but interactive costs collapse. I think that because of this, we'll see the 
collapse and demise of integrated energy companies around the world,"" 
Skilling said. 

To survive, Skilling advised companies to ""virtually reintegrate"" what they 
need. ""If you have an old vertically integrated mind set, it's tough. Give it 
up. I know there are still power producers who are buying gas reserves. I 
don't get it. It makes no sense whatsoever. You can get it online at the 
lowest cost. If your business strategy is dependent on this, it will be a 
very hard row to hoe."" 

Each stage of production will become increasingly competitive in the next 10 
years, predicted the Enron president. ""You're not just competing against 
three people in West Texas, but thousands around the world."" 

Opportunities exist, he said, for those companies that ""go with the flow and 
find ways to compete. Create low cost, dependable market interfaces...provide 
packaged turnkey solutions for customers through complex structures, 
differentiation and customization."" 

The only threat is from the old way of doing business, he said. ""But there is 
tremendous opportunity to do things for customer you've never been able to 
do."" He suggested a ""new"" energy model based on brainpower, networking, 
offering real options to customers, moving quickly and being entrepreneurial. 

""At Enron, this has been the whole premise: to be able to change by 
responding and reacting to the environment. By getting components together 
and packaging them for the customer."""
,11/30/2000,,kevin.hyatt@enron.com,sharris1@enron.com,market.team@enron.com,California Gas Prices - Market Intelligence,"Below are some notes taken while conversing with several TW customers on the 
various reasons prices have risen so dramatically out West.

El Paso line 1103 is still out of service from the August 2000 explosion.  
The remaining 2 lines are still operating at reduced flow levels taking 
200-300,000/d capacity off the market.

Storage levels in California were low to begin with.  With several coal and 
nuclear generation plants off-line (unplanned outages), the gas-burning 
generators have been running all out.

Northwest Pipeline has instituted several OFO's this month requiring shippers 
not to overpull the pipeline.  Penalty gas was selling for $22.00/MMBtu.

Beginning in November, SoCal Gas instituted its 5-day balancing requirement.  
This was not an unplanned event in the marketplace, however, it seems several 
entities were caught short early in the month and still haven't caught up.

LDC's east of California have experienced some dramatic weather but not 
severe.  They have been impacted more by firm demand to California knocking 
off IT and Alternate Firm supply destined for points east of California.  
SouthWest Gas has several alternate supply contracts with these LDC's and is 
collecting 150% of the market price from these LDC's by using SWG's full 
requirements contract on El Paso.

In addition, we now believe SoCal Gas is playing some storage games with the 
interstate pipes.  SoCal lowered their window on us for tomorrow to 580,000 
down from 750,000 due to ""lower projected gas demand"".  Sempra, Reliant, 
Dynegy, and Texaco are calling foul.  The thought is SoCal demand may be 
falling but instead of taking excess gas to replenish storage, SoCal is 
preventing higher-priced gas from reaching storage."

At the bottom 
of this synopsis, the web site address  will 
direct you to the full report released today if you would like further 
information.

EIA: Gas Takes Bigger Share Long-Term

A higher rate of economic growth will lead to a greater expansion in natural 
gas use than previously forecast over the next 20 years --- to 34.7 Tcf/ year 
in 2020, up from 31.5 Tcf --- and a 10% increase in projected prices --- from 
$2.81/Mcf to $3.13, according to the Energy Information Administration's 
latest report. 

EIA's Annual Energy Outlook 2001 (AEO2001) released today projects U.S. 
economic growth at an average rate of 3% a year over the next 20 years, up 
from its previous estimate of 2.1% per year. The economic growth will boost 
overall U.S. energy demand from 96 quadrillion Btu in 1999 to 127 quads in 
2020, up from the 121 energy quads projected by EIA one year ago (see Daily 
GPI, Nov. 10, 1999). The increase in the projection for natural gas demand by 
2020 of slightly over 3 Tcf (loosely equal to 3 quads) is responsible for 
about half the change in energy projections. 

EIA says the 62% increase in gas demand from 21.4 Tcf in 1999 to 34.7 Tcf in 
2020, will be spurred by a tripling of gas use for power generation. During 
the next 20 years 89% of new power generation units will be fueled by natural 
gas. Gas prices are expected to decline within two years from current highs. 
""In the longer term, technology improvements in the exploration and 
production of oil and natural gas are expected to moderate price increases 
even as demand for these fuels grows."" 

EIA projects world oil prices will reach $22.41/barrel (in 1999 dollars) in 
2020, up just slightly from the $22.04 in last year's forecast. 

The federal bean counters see a 1.8% average annual increase in power demand 
over the next 20 years, compared to the 1.3% they predicted last year. Prices 
will decline from the current 6.7 cents per kWh, but not as much as predicted 
last year due to the higher projected gas prices. Instead of 5.8 cents per 
kWh in 2020, EIA's AEO2001 sees electric rates holding at 6.0 cents per kWh. 

Power to be provided by nuclear generation jumped 34% from the forecast last 
year ""due to lower estimated costs for extending the life of current nuclear 
plants and higher projected natural gas prices, although total nuclear 
generation still declines as some existing plants retire."" 

Coal will still be the primary fuel for power generation, but its share will 
dwindle from 51% to 44% of the generating total.

 NGI's Daily Gas Price Index 
published : November 30, 2000

EIA Rolls Out Long List of New Gas-Fired Power 
Between 2000 and 2004, a total of 145,417 MW of nonutility generation is 
expected to be added to the U.S. power grid and 83% of that total will be 
gas-fired power generation, according to a new survey by the Energy 
Information Administration. 

The EIA's Inventory of Nonutility Electric Power Plants in the United States 
find that a total of 799 new gas-fired units, totaling 120,645 MW in 
nameplate capacity, are scheduled to be added by the end of 2004.  The 
Southeastern Electric Reliability Council is expected to receive the largest 
portion of new nonutility generation with an additional 252 units totaling 
36,636 MW.  SERC is followed by ERCOT with 109 new units totaling 21,775 MW, 
ECAR with an expected 181 additional units totaling 17,733 MW and MAIN with 
140 new units totaling 17,139 MW. 

The largest amount of new nonutility capacity, or about 61,823 MW, is 
expected to be added in 2002.  About 46,551 MW of new capacity is scheduled 
to be in service next year. 

Electric restructuring has led to a boom in nonutility power generation.  The 
EIA report found that total nonutility generation in 1999 reached 167,357 MW, 
which was a 71% increase from the previous year.  However, only 21% of the 
total represented new plants.  In 1999, about 50,000 MW of electric utility 
generation assets were purchased by nonutility generation companies.  At the 
end of 1999, nonutility generation accounted for 19.8% of total electric 
generation in the country.  The totals reported by EIA include all operable 
units, even those that did not run at all in 1999 but are expected to return 
to service. 

Gas-fired power accounted for the largest share of nonutility generation last 
year, and the Pacific Census Division accounted for 31.4% of that gas-fired 
capacity. The Pacific Census Division also accounted for the greatest number 
(1,167) of total nonutility generation and the most nonutility capacity 
(33,254 MW). California was the dominant state in the division with 30,189 
MW. 

Gas-fired (only) generation represented 29.4% (49,353 MW) of total nonutility 
capacity in 1999, and petroleum/natural gas (fuel switchable/combined) 
generation accounted for 24.2% (40,508 MW) of the total. Coal represented 
28.9% (48,501 MW).  Hydroelectric power accounted for 3.6%. Petroleum (only) 
totaled 2.2% and all other sources amounted to 11.5% of total nonutility 
generation. 

The top five states based on existing nameplate capacity are California 
(30,189 MW), Illinois (24,013 MW), New York (17,256 MW), Pennsylvania (12,483 
MW) and Texas (12,376 MW).

Over 70% of you were willing to take the time to respond.  Thank you!  This 
is our highest response to an all Enron employee survey - ever.  

In exchange for your candid feedback, we want to provide you with an overview 
of the results for our company.

We realize that you and your management have been working hard to build on 
our strengths and improve in areas of concern for us.  The results reflect 
your substantial efforts.

As you can see from the chart below, thanks to the increased focus on these 
issues provided by the Vision & Values Task Force and your efforts to improve 
communications, we have made significant progress.  

Question	1999 % Positive	2000 % Positive
Employees are encouraged to challenge the status quo	42%	47%
Decisions are communicated well	41%	50%
Employees feel free to voice opinions openly	46%	55%
Enron does a good job of acting on suggestions of employees	45%	52%
Communication across departmental lines is good	30%	34%

Congratulations on your fine efforts.  Improvements in communications across 
the company should enable better performance from all of us.  However, as you 
know, our goal is to have 60% positive in most of these areas by 2001.  So 
our work is not over and these will continue to be areas of attention. 
(Complete survey results are attached for your review.)
 
We are also pleased to report that employees across Enron expressed 
satisfaction in the following areas:
 
Employee benefits ) 82% 
Supervisors/managers deal fairly with people ) 76%
Supervisors/managers encourage teamwork ) 73%
People are treated with respect and dignity ) 73%

Transwestern Adds Receipt and Delivery Points
Transwestern Pipeline is going through a growth spurt with eight new 
interconnect projects in service or under way, which will add 300 MMcf/d in 
market area deliveries and 285 MMcf/d in new supply receipts. The new or 
expanded connection points will enhance shipper access to both new supplies 
and markets. 
""There is not a direct relationship between the two [delivery and receipt 
interconnects],"" said Jeff Fawcett, a Transwestern representative. ""It is 
kind of coincidental in nature that they came at the same time, but we have 
ongoing activities to connect new supply and create additional opportunities 
for gas to both be received into Transwestern as well as be delivered out of 
Transwestern."" 
Included in the delivery interconnect projects, Transwestern, an Enron unit, 
recently put 100 MMcf/d into service for new access to markets around Las 
Vegas with completion of the Southwest Gas interconnect located in the West 
of Thoreau area. 
Two other delivery interconnects are expected to be in service during the 
second quarter of 2001. Transwestern will add a 120 MMcf/d delivery 
interconnect with Citizens Arizona Gas for deliveries to the Griffith Energy 
Power Plant and a 90 MMcf/d delivery interconnect to a soon to be completed 
Calpine plant, both located near Kingman in the West of Thoreau area. 
On the supply side, Transwestern recently has added an 80 MMcf/d receipt 
interconnect in the East of Thoreau area with Natural Gas Pipeline Co. The 
company also said that it has hooked up a new wellhead supply interconnect 
with Enron Oil & Gas located in the East of Thoreau area. The addition will 
bump current supply from 20 MMcf/d to more than 35 MMcf/d. 
Transwestern also has three receipt projects scheduled for completion early 
next year. The pipeline said it expects to increase receipt capacity by 100 
MMcf/d at its interconnect with Red Cedar Gathering south of La Plata in the 
San Juan area later this month, and to put a new 50 MMcf/d receipt 
interconnect with Red Cedar Gathering in service by March 2001. The company 
also is planning to complete a new 40 MMcf/d receipt interconnect with El 
Paso Field Services in East of Thoreau which is scheduled to be in service 
January 2001. 
Transwestern Pipeline's system consists of approximately 2,700 miles of 
natural gas pipeline with combined east-west delivery capability of 1.7 
Bcf/day. For further information on transportation with Transwestern Pipeline 
Co., contact Fawcett at 713-853-1521."

Pinnacle West buys plant, readies expansion
Pinnacle West Energy, a generation subsidiary of Pinnacle West Capital, has 
bought a 72- MW power station from Sierra Pacific Resources subsidiary Nevada 
Power and plans to add a 500-MW facility at the site.

The purchase of the Harry Allen power station, located 30 miles northeast of 
Las Vegas, totaled $65.2 million, after adjustments for purchased power 
commitments, and is part of Sierra Pacific,s ongoing divestiture program. The 
sale agreement calls for all power generated by the station to be sold under 
contract to Nevada Power through February 2003.

Calling the purchase &a strategic link8 in efforts to increase generation in 
the West, Pinnacle  West said that, as demand grows in the region, it intends 
to add a 500-MW, gas-fired, combined-cycle unit at its new site.

&This is a very important step in our overall growth strategy to remain one 
of the top power producers in the West,8 Pinnacle West Energy President Bill 
Stewart said. &There are tremendous opportunities to expand the capacity at 
this site, and it,s ideally situated to help meet the increasing demand 
through the Southwest.8  Fueled by natural gas or diesel oil, the Harry Allen 
station currently produces electricity for southern Nevada and surrounding 
markets.

In addition to the Nevada project, Pinnacle West has been actively developing 
other generation in the region. The company has set Dec. 19 as the 
groundbreaking for its 2,120-MW Redhawk Power Plant, the largest of its 
current power projects. Located near the Palo Verde nuclear plant, 55 miles 
west of Phoenix, the facility will help meet increasing demands for 
electricity in Arizona and throughout the Southwest, according to Stewart. 
The Redhawk project,s first two units are slated to begin commercial 
operation in the summer of 2002."

El Paso Natural Gas has decided to postpone what it called ""routine"" 
maintenance projects on its system in order to maintain the flow of natural 
gas into the California market to meet the surge in demand there. The higher 
demand has been created by a shortfall in energy imports from the Northwest 
region, which has been gripped by cold weather. 

The pipeline deferred indefinitely two maintenance projects on the South 
Mainline --- at Wenden Station in Arizona and the Wenden A turbine --- that 
were scheduled to take place today and Friday. It also deferred indefinitely 
work on the North Mainline at Hackberry 2 turbine in Arizona, which was to 
have occurred Dec. 10-17. 

If El Paso had gone forward with the maintenance projects, the company said 
throughput would have been cut by about 150 MMcf/d on its South Mainline, by 
50-75 MMcf/d on the Havasu Crossover, and by 80 MMcf/d on its North Mainline. 

The maintenance work at the Wenden Station, which is located on the south end 
of the Havasu Crossing, involved replacing batteries. ""It has been agreed to 
by our operations people that those batteries are still in decent enough 
shape, [so] it's not a concern to continue running like this. And with the 
throughput situation and high gas prices [in California], it's in everybody's 
best interest that we not do this maintenance at this time,"" said Charlie 
Mathis, an administrator for pipeline control at El Paso. 

He estimated the El Paso system presently is running at 85-90% of the 
throughput level it had prior to the explosion near Carlsbad, NM, last 
August. That blast reduced the pipeline's operating capacity by 200 MMcf/d. 

Mathis said about 1.2 Bcf/d presently is being delivered into California over 
El Paso's South Mainline, and 1.5-1.7 Bcf/d is being delivered at Topock, AZ, 
over its North Mainline. 

In addition to the deferred maintenance projects, El Paso took a Waha GE 
turbine off line last Sunday to investigate a vibration problem. That has 
reduced capacity on the South Mainline by about 50 MMcf/d, said Mathis. He 
noted the turbine is scheduled to be back in service Friday. 

To offset the impact of the turbine outage on the market, El Paso decided to 
put off until this weekend work it had planned to do on Line 1100 between the 
Pecos River and the Guadalupe Stations --- a line that was affected by the 
explosion last August. The line will be taken out of service Dec. 8 and 
returned to service on Dec. 9, reducing the capacity of the South Mainline by 
50 MMcf/d each day. 

In the near term, El Paso is scheduled to run a smart pig through Line 3222 
on its North Mainline on Dec. 12, which will reduce capacity out of the San 
Juan Basin by about 50-100 MMcf/d, Mathis said. Pigging also is planned for 
Line 3201, which will cut capacity by about 150 MMcf/d. The reductions will 
affect points upstream of the Bondad Mainline and Gallup."

With today's electricity demand expanding beyond the reach of available 
supply, and nationwide electric deregulation efforts providing inconsistent 
results, distributed power just may be the next big thing, according to Bear 
Stearns analyst Robert Winters. 

With technology-laden, electricity-hungry companies popping up every time you 
turn around, and blackouts and brownouts occurring more frequently as large 
power grids are becoming less reliable, the analyst points towards 
distributed energy services as a possible solution, and maybe the ""next big 
investment opportunity for the coming decade."" In Winters' 250 page report, 
""Distributed Energy Services-The World's Power and Transportation Industries: 
Set for a Revolution-Part 2,"" he examines technologies and companies within 
the distributed energy services sector that might be able to take advantage 
of the current situation. 

""Thanks to major technological advances and energy deregulation, a wave of 
new investment in the power industry has just begun. We believe that this 
coming era in the power industry could resemble the wave of investments which 
flooded into the telecommunications industry following the breakup of AT&T in 
the early 1980's,"" said Winters. 

""Companies and municipalities need to find ways to ensure the availability of 
high quality, reliable power,"" added Winters. According to his research, 
microturbines are the best positioned of the ""new"" technologies that would be 
able to have an immediate impact on electric generation. 

He based his recommendation on the fact that microturbines are small, quiet, 
efficient and very versatile. ""They can be used as a main power source, a 
back-up power source or as an alternative when there is a spike in 
traditional energy prices,"" the analyst said. ""Microturbines can also be used 
in remote locations, including developing countries, that do not have access 
to electricity."" Another attractive feature of microturbines is their fuel 
requirements. The units often use natural gas, but can also use several other 
fuels as well. 

In the study, the analyst also examined fuel cells, flywheel technology, and 
existing reciprocating engines technologies such as diesel engines and 
Stirling engines, which he noted are enjoying a comeback. 

In addition to the report, Winters initiated coverage on two distributed 
energy companies. He labeled Active Power, a company that is pioneering 
flywheel technology, as a ""buy"" and Capstone Turbine Corp., a leading 
manufacturer of microturbines, as ""attractive."" The companies are in addition 
to two fuel cell companies he currently follows. Ballard Power is currently a 
buy, and Plug Power is rated neutral."

conference has been scheduled in Washington D.C. for January 9, 2001.  

Fuel Hedge - With gas prices running at record highs, we hedged 5,000 MMBtu/d 
of fuel for calendar 2002 at $4.50, then unwound it the following day as the 
market dipped allowing us to book a small gain in excess of $100,000.  We 
expect prices to jump again next week with the oncoming cold snap and we'll 
likely reset the hedge at higher numbers.

PNM - TW's response to PNM's request for transport proposal went out this 
week.  They are paying max rates on an East to East contract and indicated to 
us they feel the rates are not currently supported by the market.; TW however 
disagrees.  Our response to them leaves the current rate structure in place 
but has two additional tiers of volumetric incentive pricing.  As their 
volume increases, their rates go down.  In addition, we added a seasonal IT 
rate to the proposal that helps them meet any swing gas demand requirements.

Albuquerque Lateral - ENA is meeting with IPP plant owners in the Albuquerque 
region who would like to see alternative sources of gas supply besides the 
local utility.  If the operators expand the plant from a peaking unit to a 
combined-cycle unit, there is potentially enough load to justify a new 
delivery lateral off TW's mainline.  Part of the deal structure may include a 
volume incentive rate as throughput increases in the lateral.  Next step for 
TW is to build a rate matrix under several different operating scenarios.  
Responses are due to ENA by Friday 12/15.

Black Mesa Project - We continue to evaluate the potential of converting the 
Black Mesa coal slurry line owned by Northern Border into gas service.  The 
big advantage for TW is it will increase our capacity to bring San Juan gas 
to the California border but there is also a positive environmental play for 
Black Mesa and coal slurry along with Mohave and coal pollution affecting the 
Grand Canyon.  This whole project is contingent on several factors, not the 
least of which is working with Mohave Generating Station majority owner AES 
(70%) to convert the plant to gas and working with the Navajo who could lose 
a large export market for their coal.  ENA has agreed to approach AES on this 
project in the near future once their negotiations on the Las Vegas power 
plant are complete.  Legal is checking the existing ROW to see if there are 
limitations on the pipe usage.  

Burlington Claim - We are assembling the volume and revenue impact figures of 
the November train derailment for submission to Burlington's claims 
adjusters.    This will be combined with the total operations costs."

Chemical companies, forced to shut in operations because of high natural gas 
prices, are nevertheless making money --- by selling gas futures contracts. 

Terra Industries and Mississippi Chemical Corp. became the latest companies 
to announce cutbacks related to current natural gas costs. 

Iowa-based Terra Industries said it had sold off a portion of its December 
natural gas purchases, and shutdown 50% of its Verdigis, OK, ammonia 
facility. The company had previously reported that it would not operate its 
Bytheville, AR, and Beaumont, TX, facilities during the month of December as 
well. 

In a similar maneuver, Mississippi Chemical Corp., a producer of nitrogen, 
phosphorus and potassium-based products in Mississippi, Louisiana and New 
Mexico, reported the sale of all of its natural gas futures contracts from 
January forward, in order to take full advantage of the opportunity uncovered 
by soaring natural gas prices. Mississippi Chemical said it expects to 
realize a pre-tax gain of $16 million in its second fiscal quarter ending 
Dec. 31 from the recently sold contracts. 

The problem lies in the fact that escalating natural gas costs are not being 
mimicked by chemical prices. An overabundance on the market has kept chemical 
prices relatively low, while gas prices, a feedstock for some chemicals, 
continue to climb. The difference in the latest shutdowns is that the 
companies involved have openly announced they have sold their gas contracts 
off because it is more profitable than manufacturing their products, said Ron 
Phillips of The Fertilizer Institute. 

Duke Energy's Ken Nyiri, divisional director of strategic planning and 
research, commented on Mississippi Chemical's transactions, ""I guess they 
probably made about a $4/MMBtu margin on the gas, which is significantly more 
than they could make on the ammonia; in fact, they would have lost $30/unit. 
Their ammonia was probably costing them about $205/ton to make (with gas 
bought at $5/MMBtu in November) and the market today is at $205 so basically 
they would break even on their ammonia production costs. By selling the gas 
at around $9/MMBtu they made $4/MMBtu. It was just a question of do they 
convert the gas to ammonia and make nothing on it, or do they sell the gas 
and make $16 million."" 

Michael L. Bennett, executive vice president of Terra, said, ""The natural gas 
price increase since our December requirements were purchased for Verdigris 
permitted us to sell a portion of those purchases and generate higher gross 
profits than could be realized from selling the products manufactured with 
the natural gas. We will evaluate the economics of bringing Verdigris back to 
full production near the end of December when January's natural gas purchase 
commitments must be made."" 

Terra estimates the idled facilities represent 40%, 30%, 77% and 88% of the 
company's North American ammonia, UAN, urea and methanol manufacturing 
capacity, respectively. The production of all four chemicals are heavily 
dependent on natural gas. Phillips said ""The latest data we had in October 
was that of the companies that we survey, which is not the entire ammonia 
market, but a good bit of it, we were looking at operating rates of 76%."" 

Currently, a total of 4-5 million tons/year of ammonia production capacity is 
out of service out of about 20-21 million tons/year of production capacity. 
""Clearly some of these folks have been selling their gas [rather than 
producing ammonia],"" said Nyiri. ""It's the prudent thing to do, I think, in 
this marketplace. Buy your ammonia if you can. At $9 gas, that costs you 
$350/ton to make the ammonia, which is $145 more than the current market is 
willing to pay."" 

A spokeswoman for Mississippi Chemical said the company held on to its 
December gas contracts, and has been operating at varied levels of capacity 
throughout 2000 (see Daily GPI, June 30). ""Depending on what the gas prices 
are, and what our product prices are around the January-February time frame, 
we will make decisions then on our operations rate [capacity],"" said Melinda 
Hood, a Mississippi Chemical spokeswoman. 

Charles O. Dunn, CEO of Mississippi Chemical, said, ""We remain committed to 
the nitrogen business and our customers, but we also have to take advantage 
of opportunities to optimize cash flow during these challenging times. It is 
our belief that the current unprecedented natural gas prices are unlikely to 
be sustained during the intermediate term,"" stated Dunn. ""As a result, we 
felt it was in the company's best interest to sell our futures positions to 
lock in the substantial gain afforded by the recent increase in natural gas 
prices. Going forward, we will continue to determine operating levels for our 
plants based on the relationship between natural gas prices, nitrogen product 
prices and our customers' requirements, as we have been doing for some time."" 

International imports are also hurting U.S. producers. Currently, there is a 
surplus of ammonia in the international market, which is holding ammonia 
prices down. U.S. fertilizer producers can't compete with the international 
market. Gas prices are 46 cents/MMBtu in Russia, 50 cents to $1/MMBtu in 
Argentina and Venezuela, and $1/MMBtu in Trinidad. The U.S. imports 5.5 
million tons of ammonia each year. Fertilizers represent 80% of the demand 
for ammonia in the United States. 

Terra Industries said its facilities would resume production as soon as it 
became economical again --- whether from gas prices declining or nitrogen and 
methanol prices rising, just as long as ""prices reach levels allowing 
positive cash flows."" 

Nyiri said he believes relief is in sight. He pointed out that the ammonia 
market has been sitting around the $205/ton level for the last several 
months, but believes ammonia prices will have to increase entering the next 
planting season. ""I've got my model peaking out around $250/ton in April or 
May and at that time I have gas costs coming down."" At that point, the 1-2 
Bcf/d of demand from the fertilizer production industry should begin 
returning to service."

,12/12/2000,,enron.announcements@enron.com,all.states@enron.com,,Improved Process for Engaging Temporary Workers,"As you are aware, Enron utilizes temporary staffing services to satisfy 
staffing requirements throughout the company.  For the past several months, a 
project team, representing Enron,s temporary staffing users, have researched 
and evaluated alternative Managed Services programs to determine which source 
would best meet our current and future needs in terms of quality, performance 
and cost containment objectives.  The Business Unit Implementation Project 
Team members are: 

Laurie Koenig, Operations Management, EES
Carolyn Vigne, Administration, EE&CC
Linda Martin, Accounting & Accounts Payable, Corporate
Beverly Stephens, Administration, ENA
Norma Hasenjager, Human Resources, ET&S
Peggy McCurley, Administration, Networks
Jane Ellen Weaver, Enron Broadband Services
Paulette Obrecht, Legal, Corporate
George Weber, GSS

In addition, Eric Merten (EBS), Kathy Cook (EE&CC), Carolyn Gilley (ENA), 
Larry Dallman (Corp/AP), and Diane Eckels (GSS) were active members of the 
Selection Project Team.

As a result of the team,s efforts, we are pleased to announce the beginning 
of a strategic alliance with CORESTAFF,s Managed Services Group.  This group 
will function as a vendor-neutral management entity overseeing all staffing 
vendors in the program scope. They will also provide a web based online 
technology tool that will enhance the ordering and reporting capabilities.  
The goal of our alliance with CORESTAFF is to make obtaining a temporary 
worker with the right skills and experience easier while protecting the best 
interests of the organization. 

We plan to implement Phase I of this improvement effective January 2, 2001.  
This Phase I of the implementation will encompass administrative/clerical 
temporary workers at the Houston locations only. If you currently have 
administrative/clerical temporary workers in your department, the enhancement 
will not affect their position. In an effort to preserve relationships, all 
current staffing vendors will be invited to participate in this enhanced 
program.  CORESTAFF shares our commitment to minimize any disruptions in 
service during this transition. 
 
We expect to incorporate the administrative/clerical workers in Omaha, 
Seattle and Portland in Phase II, which is scheduled for February, 2001.  The 
scope and timing of any additional phases will be determined after these two 
phases have been completed.

Realizing the impact that the temporary workforce has in business today, we 
selected CORESTAFF,s Managed Services Group based on their exceptional 
management team, commitment to quality service, and creative solutions to our 
staffing needs.  The relationship promises to offer Enron a cost effective 
and simple means for obtaining temporary employees.

In the coming weeks, Enron and CORESTAFF,s Managed Services Group will be 
communicating to Enron,s administrative/clerical temporary staffing vendors 
about the new process.  

There are many benefits to this new Managed Services program, which are 
outlined on the attached page.  More details on how to utilize CORESTAFF,s 
Managed Services program will be announced soon and meetings will be 
scheduled to demonstrate the reporting system and to meet the Managed 
Services team.

What is Managed Services?

CORESTAFF,s Managed Services program includes:

? Vendor-neutral management model
? Equal distribution of staffing orders to all staffing partners
? Web-based application with online ordering, data capture and customized 
reporting
? Benchmarking and performance measurement for continuous improvement
? Methodologies for accurate skill-matching and fulfillment efficiencies 

Key Benefits

? More vendors working on each order from the outset ) faster access to 
available talent pools
? Standardized mark-ups and fees to manage costs more effectively
? Online access to requisition status for users 
? Robust databases offering managers enhanced tracking and reporting of 
temporary usage and expenditures
? Standard and customized reporting capabilities -- online
? Tenured, experienced Managed Services team on-site to assist users in 
accessing web site, identifying usage trends, preparing specialized reports, 
etc.

retention policy.  The change will go into effect Friday, December 15, 2000.

The greatest impact will be to your ""sent mail,"" which will be retained only 
30 days as compared to the current 365 days.  

As a reminder, you should not use the email system to store important 
documents.
They should be saved to your network directory which is regularly backed up.

However, for 'sent' messages you want to keep longer than 30 days in the 
email system, you should move the messages from the Sent Mail to a specific 
folder where the messages can be kept 365 days.

The scope of the e-mail retention policy includes all forms of electronic 
mail, for example, Lotus Notes Mail, Internet e-mail, Outlook e-mail, and 
voice mail.

Enron supports a work environment in which information is freely exchanged 
and encourages employees, contractors, and agents working on behalf of Enron 
to use its computers and related electronic resources in accomplishing their 
work.  Computers, systems, and networks and the work products they contain 
are Enron property and subject to Enron review and control.  All Enron 
employees, contractors, and agents are responsible for using the computing 
resources provided to them by Enron in an appropriate manner.

posted 10:50 AM (CST) Dec 13, 2000 

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has authorized Transcontinental Gas 
Pipe Line (Transco) to phase in construction of its 700 MMcf/d MarketLink 
project, which would expand its Leidy Line from western Pennsylvania to 
markets in New Jersey and New York.

Phase I of MarketLink would add 166,000 Dth/d of new firm capacity on Transco 
to serve five shippers beginning Nov. 1, 2001. Phase II would add 130,000 
Dth/d to serve two shippers by Nov. 1 2002. FERC denied requests by the state 
of New Jersey and the state's Department of Law and Public Safety to rescind 
and vacate an April certificate approving construction of the entire 
MarketLink project. However, the Commission is requiring Transco to file 
executed contracts fully subscribing the remaining capacity within four 
months of the order. If the contracts are not filed, Transco can not initiate 
eminent domain proceedings with respect to the remaining facilities covered 
by the original certificate.

The Commission also granted Questar a preliminary determination on 
non-environmental grounds, saying its proposed Mainline 104 looping project 
and interconnection with Kern River Pipeline is required by the public. The 
$80.8 million Questar project would add 272,000 Dth/d of capacity. M.L. 104 
would run from coal-seam reserves in the Uinta Basin near Price, UT, to the 
Payson Citygate and the connection with Kern River. The project would loop a 
portion of Questar's M.L. No. 40 and the entire M.L. No. 41. Both lines 
currently are running full."

The introduction of the 1.325 Bcf/d Alliance Pipeline into the North American 
gas market appears to have had less of an impact on gas flows out of western 
Canada than expected, according to representatives of TransCanada PipeLines, 
PG&E Gas Transmission and Alliance. Extremely strong gas demand in the 
Pacific Northwest, California and in the Midwest has produced continued high 
load factors on TransCanada and PG&E GT-NW despite the presence of their huge 
new rival for Western Canadian supply. 

""The contract picture changed significantly on [TransCanada] since the first 
of November and primarily at our Empress, AB, delivery point into the 
TransCanada mainline from the Alberta pipe, but actual physical gas flows [at 
about 6 Bcf/d] have not changed correspondingly,"" said Klaus Exner, director 
of pipeline system operations at TransCanada. ""The big picture overview that 
I would give you is that demand is very high in the Pacific Northwest and 
California and we continue to run at the highest possible load factor down 
that leg of our pipeline system out of Alberta, through British Columbia and 
into the PG&E systems. That hasn't let up at all and we don't foresee that 
letting up."" 

PG&E Gas Transmission Spokeswoman Sandra McDonough said PG&E GT-NW has been 
running full at 2.6 Bcf/d for some time and is delivering 900 MMcf/d to 
non-California load in the Pacific Northwest. ""We're turning back demand 
right now. Every power plant in this region is running full tilt. Tuscarora 
[Gas Transmission], the Nevada pipeline, is full. Our Northwest deliveries 
are fixed. We're delivering as much as we can deliver right now."" 

TransCanada's other major export route out of the Western Canadian 
Sedimentary Basin is the Foothills and Northern Border route into the 
Midwest. It also continues to operate at high load factors. ""We didn't see a 
huge drop-off in physical flows post Nov. 1. We've seen the IT volumes come 
up considerably,"" said Exner. ""The one thing that has changed is the 
volatility of the flows. Customers are making frequent intraday nomination 
changes and we're seeing more up and down and day-to-day variations, 
according to the weather and the markets, than we would have when we had a 
higher firm contract level. The fluctuations are driven purely by the price 
differential between AECO and the Dawn Hub in Ontario, which indicates 
whether or not interruptible flow on the mainline is in the money or not."" 

Alliance Pipeline spokesman Jack Crawford said the system has been running 
flat out at about 1.325 Bcf/d since the valves were opened for commercial 
service Dec. 1. He also said the pipeline soon would be testing to increase 
flows on the system. It has been estimated that Alliance could increase gas 
flows to 1.5 Bcf/d with existing compression. The additional capacity would 
be divided up among existing shippers, Crawford said. ""We haven't cranked up 
the system above the contract capacity yet. We probably won't do that for a 
couple weeks until we get things ironed out. Frankly though, I'm not sure

first six months of this year. You continue to make it happen.  We recognize 
that you work hard every day to accomplish Enron,s business goals, and we are 
pleased that many of you have shared in the company,s financial success 
through Enron stock options. 

As you may know, the current employee stock option program (also known as the 
All Employee Stock Option Program or AESOP) began in 1994 and provided value 
to participants through 2000.  Employees who have participated in this 
program from its inception have realized a 1,119% increase in the value of 
their stock options (assuming a stock price of $70) over the life of the 
program.   

Enron stock options are a valuable part of your total compensation package 
and a contributing factor to your performance and to Enron,s continued 
success.  Therefore, the Enron Executive Committee and the Compensation and 
Management Development Committee of the Enron Board of Directors have decided 
to continue to offer stock options as a part of your compensation package.

On May 1, 2000, the Committee approved an employee stock option program for 
calendar years 2001 - 2005 (EnronOptions ) Your Stock Option Program).  It is 
expected that EnronOptions ) Your Stock Option Program will be granted, 
effective on or about December 29, 2000, for those employees who are eligible 
on that date (please see note below).  The new program, which is subject to 
final approval by Enron,s Board of Directors, is as follows:

? EnronOptions ) Your Stock Option Program will give stock options to 
eligible full-time and part-time regular employees in domestic and 
international companies/locations.
? The grant of non-qualified stock options will equal 25% of annual base 
salary (5% of annual base salary for each year of a 5-year period) on 
December 29, 2000. (Salary calculation and value may vary in some 
international locations.)
? The Board will grant the stock options on December 29, 2000.
? Eligible employees hired in subsequent years will receive a prorated grant 
of stock options.

Why commit your talent and energy to Enron?  EnronOptions ) Your Stock Option 
Program, among other good reasons( that,s why.

In the coming weeks, you will be receiving more details about EnronOptions ) 
Your Stock Option Program.  To provide information and answer your questions, 
we will introduce a special link on the Human Resources web-site, host 
several eSpeak sessions and continue to communicate with you on a regular 
basis.  In the meantime, if you have immediate questions, please contact your 
Human Resources representative. 

Note: In addition to final approval by Enron,s Board of Directors, granting 
of options will be subject to New York Stock Exchange and state and federal 
regulatory requirements.  It is expected that EnronOptions ) Your Stock 
Option Program will be available to most Enron employees; however, some Enron 
companies, employees may not be eligible due to legal, accounting, tax, labor 
or business issues.  As you know, Enron changes to meet the needs of the 
marketplaces we serve.  Given that need to change, we will continue to refine 
the eligibility for EnronOptions ) Your Stock Option Program and will 
communicate more details throughout the year with final eligibility being 
determined on December 29, 2000."
,10/31/2000,,ets.announcement@enron.com,enron.operations@enron.com,,Year-End Performance Feedback - Let's Do It Right!,"The Performance Evaluation Process (PEP) system is now open through Friday, 
Nov. 17, for all employees to solicit and provide performance feedback.  This 
process is powerful . . . if we provide meaningful feedback.

Management, when determining performance ratings, participating in PRC 
meetings, and providing feedback to employees, depends on the comments 
received via PEP.  For the users of PEP information to fully understand the 
employee,s performance and the ratings identified, specific comments are 
needed to explain each rating, including the overall rating.  It's most 
beneficial to describe specifically what the employee did and why their 
action was productive or why it needs improvement.

Comments on areas of strength as well as suggesting areas needing improvement 
are both important.  Just as each of us needs feedback and coaching to 
improve our skills in sports or other pursuits, we also need to know what and 
how we can improve our work skills and behaviors.  We all benefit from 
constructive feedback.

Please actively participate in the year-end PEP process and make your input 
meaningful.

PEP Feedback Tips:
? Provide feedback when requested.
? Rate only those skills and behaviors you have observed this year.
? Provide specific comments with specific examples.
? Indicate performance needs improvement when appropriate.


Some Feedback Examples:


Skill/Behavior	Ineffective
	Feedback	Improved
		Feedback
Communication	""Jack communicates well.""	""Jack was called on to provide written 
updates for the Ajax project and he clearly conveyed pertinent information 
that was easy to read, timely and suited for his audience.  The Accounting & 
Finance management team commented on how his reports saved them time.""
Teamwork	""Sue,s a poor team player.""	""When we got to +crunch, time sending out year-end 
reports, Sue chose to spend a day preparing her goals for next year, instead 
of pitching in and helping check figures and box up reports with everyone 
else.  We missed the shipping deadline and our reports were received a day 
late.  This impacted our customers and caused our team to miss an important 
goal.""
Innovation	""Jennifer comes up with great new ideas.""	""From reading an article on data 
transmitting devices, Jennifer identified a tool she thought could be 
utilized in our remote gas measurement applications.  Now implemented, the 
remote measurement device has saved us significant monies and time.""
Leadership	""Tom often displays inappropriate leadership skills.""	""Although Tom closes 
big deals and contributes significantly to the success of ETS, he lacks the 
ability to gain the support and commitment of others when dealing with 
support groups across departmental lines.  For greater success, he should 
listen more and provide rationale for his ideas and directives.""
Technical	""Bill,s technical skills are weak.""	""On three occasions, Bill misaligned 
columns or overlaid critical data when updating departmental, electronic 
spreadsheets.  These errors caused more than 30 hours of rework and 
approximately 8 hours of overtime to fix the mistakes.""

their other pipelines, like they have
on NGPL.

Shippers Protest KMI's Order 637 Tariff Changes

Kinder Morgan Interstate Gas Transmission (KMI) has attempted an end run 
around FERC's Order 637,
filing wide-ranging operational and rate changes early under expedited tariff 
procedures to avoid the
more rigorous review in store for compliance filings, according to customer 
protests. 

Items in KMI's tariff filing fall into no less than 13 general categories, 
Indicated Shippers said. They include
imbalance provisions, storage balances, small customer service, gas quality, 
point allocations, curtailment 
priorities, right of first refusal, scheduling priorities, incidental 
purchase and sale, capacity release,
unauthorized gas, capacity rights overrun charge, and miscellaneous. 

Indicated Shippers called for summary rejection or maximum suspension of 
KMI's June 5 tariff filing (RP00-316), 
saying ""most of the changes proposed in this case represent an effort by KMI 
to implement elements of 
Order 637 selectively and in a manner designed to minimize the opportunity 
for meaningful review and 
comment by KMI's customers."" Only 12 days are allowed for intervention and 
comment on usually routine 
tariff filings, while the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has allotted 
30 days for comments on 
Order 637 compliance filings. KMI was among the group of pipelines slated to 
make compliance filings June 15. 

KMI said its filing did not constitute its compliance filing, but was aimed 
at changing its tariff to reflect ""the 
current natural gas business climate and evolving business practices.."" It 
did acknowledge, ""A number of the 
changes proposed herein are consistent with and advance the Commission's 
goals in Order No. 637."" 

Indicated Shippers also protested changes that would make decisions regarding 
negative storage imbalances 
and end of season inventory swaps a matter of KMI's discretion without any 
standards on how those decisions 
would be made. The shippers also protested changes to the default methodology 
for point allocations for billing 
purposes, and the injection of KMI discretion into the formula for accepting 
or rejecting predetermined allocation 
agreements with upstream or downstream parties. In addition curtailment 
provisions filed by KMI appear to be 
contrary to Order 637-A's mandate that shippers moving gas within the primary 
path should have primary rights. 

The filing also would give the pipeline the opportunity to bottle up 
significant quantities of coal bed methane gas 
in Wyoming's Powder River Basin by imposing more rigorous standards on 
nitrogen content, according to 
Western Gas Resources. A key change would impose a nitrogen gas quality 
specification of 3% by volume. 
While KMI states the change is necessary to accommodate transfers with 
interconnecting pipelines, six of the 
seven connecting pipelines identified have no nitrogen specifications. Only 
KMI's affiliate, Natural Gas
Pipeline Co. of America, has similar rules, Western Gas said. 

""KMI's proposed nitrogen specification would enable KMI to refuse to accept 
coal bed methane production for 
transportation, thereby foreclosing the availability of one of the principal 
means of downstream pipeline egress 
out of Powder River production areas,"" Western Gas added. Producers would 
have to shut in production while 
they construct costly nitrogen facilities. This could ""create at least a 
temporary gap in the downstream 
movement of coal bed supplies to mid-continent and eastern markets, thus 
frustrating consumer access to 
these significant supplies."""

As you know, EPMI has been buying gas from the West Gas Desk for Harbor Cogen.  We dispatch this plant and buy their electricity.  Over the winter the Gas Desk was selling them (us) gas at Gas Daily Mid-Point plus $.05/MMBtu, based on consumption.  Since they have not operated that much there is not much money at stake.  With higher summer usage and the greater volatility at the border, however, this price is no longer fair for the Gas Desk.  

So, a couple weeks ago, I proposed a price increase to Harbor that would have them paying Gas Daily Mid-Point plus $.15/MMBtu still based on consumption.  They have been calling around and have an alternative deal, I think with Amoco that would have them paying Gas Daily Mid Point plus $.10/MMBtu based on scheduled volumes, not consumption.  We have to decide this week if we want to keep selling them gas or let them go to Amoco.

I hate to give up business, but it seems like we should unless we get a fair price.

Attached is a summary of a new structure that I think would retain the deal.  It changes the volume from scheduled versus consumption, and has them paying index plus $.10/MMBtu.  Schedules would be due by 8:30 and the volumes could not change over weekends.  I would suggest that it is better to keep this deal if I can get them to agree to the attached structure.  Please look it over and see what you think.  I will call later today to discuss.

Tana tells me you are looking for some guidance as to which Enron entity 
should be used for booking trading transactions with various counterparties.  
There are a couple of general rules that apply to ""normal"" trading 
circumstances and I'll spell them out below, but remember that these are not 
hard and fast rules and may go straight out the window when circumstances 
vary (even just a little bit) from ""normal.""  For example, abnormal 
situations exist where the trading transaction is in connection with another 
transaction with an Enron company (e.g. a financing or equity investment), 
the counterparty has a legally justifiable desire to trade with a certain 
Enron company, the product being traded is only traded by a particular Enron 
company or the counterparty is in a jurisdiction outside the country where we 
are trading (except as spelled out below).  Having said all that, the 
following rules (generally tax driven) can be used as general guidelines:

1. If there is no master agreement in place between the counterparty and an 
Enron company, the trade should be entered into on behalf of the Enron 
company based in the country where the Enron trader is when the trade is 
concluded and, if there is any hope of further trading with the counterparty, 
Credit and Legal should be notified to negotiate a master agreement.  Of 
course, if the counterparty is outside the country where we are trading, 
Legal should be consulted ahead of time (there are some countries where 
derivatives are actually illegal, special procedures must be followed or 
can't be done by us from the U.S.).

2. If there is a master agreement between the counterparty and either ENA or 
Enron Canada, and the Enron trader is in the U.S. or Canada, the trade should 
be entered into by the trader on behalf of the Enron company that is party to 
the master agreement.  If the trader is outside of the U.S. or Canada, other 
rules may apply.  

3. If there is a master agreement between the counterparty and ECT 
International (usually only European counterparties), and the Enron trader is 
in the U.S. or the U.K., the trade should be entered into by the trader on 
behalf of ECT International.  Note that there are special considerations if 
the trader is in the U.K. based on U.K. regulatory issues (the trade is 
actually ""arranged"" by Enron Europe Finance and Trading Ltd. on behalf of ECT 
International).  If such a master exists but the trader is not in the U.S. or 
U.K., the trade should be handed off to a trader located in one of those two 
countries for final negotiation and execution.  It would be a good idea to 
consult with Legal or Tax if this comes up for more specific advice.  

These general rules relate to which Enron entity should be the legal 
counterparty to the transactions.  This doesn't determine where within the 
Enron family the actual risk should ultimately reside.  If we want the risk 
to be in an Enron company other than the Enron counterparty for contractual 
purposes, an intercompany transaction should be booked (probably through RMT) 
to get the risk in the right place."

Dear Tana Jones:

The New York Mercantile Exchange is excited and we want to tell you why.
NYMEX is about to launch enymexsm  and its prospects are invigorating.

Over-the-counter (OTC) participants will now be able to execute transactions
on the same platform as NYMEX futures.  The Exchange plans to use its proven
clearing infrastructure to introduce complete counter-party risk management,
and create net margining with Exchange futures markets by calculating a
consolidated clearing position.  Subsequent enymexsm functionality will also
provide an internet-based interface to the established Exchange futures
market by routing futures orders to the trading floor and the NYMEX ACCESSc
electronic trading system, depending on the session.

Attached please find information announcing the first slate of products to
be offered for listing on enymexsm .

Since we value your business as a forerunner in this industry, we are
enclosing for your review the sale registration form, which consists of the
enymexsm System User Agreement.  Please review, sign and return to Robert A.
Dagistino, Director of Customer Service, New York Mercantile Exchange, One
North End Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10282.  Any questions can be answered via
email at rdagistino@nymex.com or via telephone at 212-299-2429.

The signatory must be an executive officer or partner of the firm.  We are
also attaching two ""click-on screens"" that users will view when they first
log on to the system.

Please note that since the enymexsm products will be cleared you will also
need to obtain authorization from a clearing member for your account.

A NYMEX team, consisting of members of our Board, local traders and staff,
will be visiting each one of you in person.  They will discuss with you how
to utilize the benefits of NYMEX to achieve precision in many of your
customized transactions.

We look forward to receiving your registration and participation in what is
intended to be the premier, global exchange for forward trading and clearing
contracts focusing on energy and metals products.

Sincerely,

 <<...OLE_Obj...>>
Neal Wolkoff,
Executive Vice President

Re:
--	Amendments to NYMEX Division Position Limit and Reporting Rules
--	Amendments to Large Trader Reporting Requirements for Light Sweet
        Crude Oil and the Addition of Brent Crude Oil

The Board of Directors of the New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc. has approved various amendments to NYMEX Division Chapter 9 rules which, in general, move away from hard position limits ""in any one month and all months combined"" to position accountability standards. These amendments shall be effective as of the open of trading on Friday, June 15, 2001.

The amendments to any one month, all months combined and option quadrants limits as cited in Rule 9.26, position accountability will provide for the ability for any participant to exceed the prescribed levels. (As a note: the levels advocated for any one month and all months combined are the levels currently in place for all months combined under the existing rule structure. The currently defined any one month limits, which are lower than the all months limits, are being deleted. Additionally, the gross side of market rules are deleted.) Any market participant exceeding the defined position accountability levels will be subject to being contacted by the Exchange when the Exchange deems it necessary, and will be required to supply relevant information as to its position and the status of its account. If the participant refuses to do so, or if the Exchange believes the position, by its size, is a threat to the orderly operation of the market, a market participant can be direct!
ed!
 either to not increase or to decrease its position.

The existing current delivery month on expiration limits as defined in existing Rule 9.27 will be unchanged and subject to hedge/swap exemptions as they are today. The only caveat to this is that certain cash-settled enymexsm contracts will operate with some level of position accountability in the current delivery month.

Further, the large trader reporting levels cited in Rule 9.34 for Light Sweet Crude Oil futures has been amended from 300 to 350 contracts to coincide with existing CFTC standards. The soon to be traded Brent Crude Oil futures' reporting level has been added at the same level of 350 contracts.

Lastly, the any one month/all months position accountability level for the Brent Crude Oil contract of 20,000 has been added.

All amended rules can be found on the New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc. website @ http://www.nymex.com/refernce/notices/2001/ntm_191r.htm."

TO:
All NYMEX Division and COMEX Division Clearing Members

FROM:
Neal L. Wolkoff, Executive Vice President

RE:
Implementation of Amendments on Use of Letters of Credit, Certain Securities and Deliverable Warehouse Receipts as Margin  for NYMEX and COMEX Transactions

DATE:
June 1, 2001
=============================
1. Implementation of Rule Amendments. As previously announced in Notice to Members #01-147 (May 4, 2001), this Notice is to remind NYMEX and COMEX Clearing Members of rule amendments that become effective today, June 1, 2001, that expand the types of non-cash assets that customers may deposit with their Clearing Members for margin purposes.

2. Exchange Form for Pass-Through Letters of Credit. Clearing Members are further advised that a form has been prepared by the Exchange that will serve as the authorized  uniform form for irrevocable letters of credit for use on a pass-through basis at the Exchange.  This form may be obtained from the Exchange's Clearing Department.

3. Exchange Form for Pass-Through Letters of Credit: Specification of Joint Beneficiary. The Pass-Through Letter of Credit differs from the Standard Letter of Credit in that the Pass-Through Letter of Credit provides for Joint Beneficiaries.  In this regard, a Pass-Through Letter of Credit to be used as margin on the NYMEX Division should specify NYMEX as one of the Joint Beneficiaries.  By comparison, a Pass-Through Letter of Credit to be used as margin on the COMEX Division should specify the COMEX Clearing Association as one of the Joint Beneficiaries.

4. Restriction on Issuers of Letters of Credit. Please note that, under  applicable NYMEX and COMEX rules, a Clearing Member that is a bank subsidiary or is an affiliate of a bank may not deposit with the applicable Clearing House a letter of credit issued or confirmed by such bank, bank parent or affiliate bank.




As to the actual rule amendments, which are attached below, these rule changes permit the use of letters of credit, certain securities and deliverable warehouse receipts by customers to meet their margin requirements. The rule changes provide for consistent treatment in the use of such assets for both NYMEX and COMEX Divisions.

Letters of Credit.  As a result of the rule changes, letters of credit (LCs) now will be allowed for customer margin on both divisions.

Use of Letters of Credit on Pass-Through Basis.  In addition, the rule changes allow letters of credit to be used on a ""pass-through"" basis on both divisions.  In other words, Clearing Members on both divisions will be able to pledge to the applicable clearinghouse certain LCs posted by customers. It should be noted that while securities and deliverable warehouse receipts, as detailed below, may be used by customers for margin purposes, such assets may not be used on a pass-through basis by a Clearing Member to meet its margin obligations with the clearinghouse.

Securities. Customers also will be able to deposit with their Clearing Members certain types of securities as margin. The types of acceptable securities are the kinds of securities that have been accepted for some time on the COMEX Division.  Specifically, the rule changes will permit customers to deposit the following types of securities as margin with Clearing Members on either division:

securities listed for trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. or the American Stock Exchange, Inc., or which are traded in the over-the-counter market approved for margin by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Board except that such securities must be free from liens and encumbrances; can represent no more than 5% of the issued and outstanding shares of any one issuer; and will be valued for purposes of margin at 75% of their market value.

Deliverable Warehouse Receipts. On both divisions, deliverable warehouse receipts for any of the commodities traded on the Exchange will be accepted as customer margin provided that such receipts will be valued as margin at no more than 75% of the value of the commodity.

If you have any questions concerning this change, please contact Bernard Purta, Senior Vice President, Regulatory Affairs and Operations, at (212) 299- 2380; Arthur McCoy, Vice President, Financial Surveillance Section, NYMEX Compliance Department, at (212) 299-2928; or Charles Bebel, Vice President, Clearing Department, at (212) 299-2130.


AMENDMENTS TO NYMEX RULE 4.01 (""CUSTOMER'S MARGINS""), NYMEX RULE 9.05 (""MARGINS"") AND TO COMEX CLEARING ASSOCIATION RULE 48 (""DEPOSIT OF SECURITIES AND LETTERS OF CREDIT AS ORIGINAL MARGIN"")

(Asterisks indicate additions; brackets indicate deletions.)

Rule 4.01. CUSTOMER'S MARGINS

(A) Initial margin at least equal to the level set for customers shall be required of all customers. In no case shall a customer's initial margin be less than a specified amount per contract, or a specified percentage of the market value at which any commodity is bought or sold, such customer's margin to be determined and announced by the Board of Directors or its designee.

 (B) Once the required initial margin has been deposited for each individual transaction, such trade and such margin shall, for the purposes of this rule, lose their individual identity and be commingled with all other trades and margins in the same commodity for the same customer account.

 (C) When the margin (Net Liquidating Value plus Non-Cash Deposits) in a customer's account declines below the maintenance margin requirement applicable to the open positions carried in such account, the Member Firm carrying said account is required to collect (call) from the customer such funds, which when deposited, will restore it to the then prevailing initial margin requirement.

 (D) A Member Firm shall not accept orders for new trades on behalf of an undermargined customer account other than those which reduce its initial margin requirement unless such Member Firm has been given assurances by said customer that funds sufficient to restore the account to its then prevailing initial margin requirement are forthcoming and will be received in a reasonable amount of time not to exceed one business day for Floor Members and three business days for all other customers.

(E)(1) A Member Firm may accept deposits from its customers in one or more of the following forms as margin to cover open NYMEX Division positions:

 (a) United States Currency; or any currency freely convertible to United States currency; provided that if foreign currency is deposited, its value shall be calculated so that at the current rate of exchange the U.S. dollar equivalent of the foreign currency satisfies the customer's margin obligation.

 (b) securities issued by the Department of the Treasury of the United States maturing within ten (10) years of the date of the deposit and guaranteed as to principal and interest by the United States Government. Such securities shall be valued at ninety five percent (95%) of par value.

*(c) securities which are listed for trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. or the American Stock Exchange, Inc., or which are traded in the over-the-counter market approved for margin by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Board provided that such securities; (i) are free from liens and encumbrances; (ii) represent no more than 5% of the issued and outstanding shares of any one issuer; and (iii) are valued at 75% of the market value thereof;

(d) a letter of credit in favor of a clearing member carrying an account, or in the case of any letter or credit to be used on a pass-through basis with the Clearing House a letter of credit in favor of the Exchange.  All letters of credit shall be issued in such form as may be prescribed by the Exchange and by a depository which has been approved by the Exchange for issuance and confirmation of letters of credit drawn in favor of the Clearing Members or in favor of the Exchange, as applicable.

(e) deliverable warehouse receipts for commodities traded on the Exchange provided that such receipts will be valued as margin at no more than 75% of the value of the commodity.*

[(c)] *(f)* The net liquidating value in a customer's account over the initial margin requirements for the positions carried for such account.

(2) A Member Firm may accept deposits from its customers in one or more of the following forms as margin to cover open COMEX Division positions:

(a) United States currency, checks payable in United States currency, or currency freely convertible to United States currency; provided that if foreign currency is deposited, its value shall be calculated so that at the current rate of exchange the U.S. dollar equivalent of the foreign currency satisfies the customer's margin obligations;

(b) the net liquidating value in a customer's account over the initial margin requirements for the positions carried for such account;

(c) securities issued or guaranteed by the United States, provided that such securities shall be valued at the lower of the par or market value thereof;

(d) securities which are listed for trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. or the American Stock Exchange, Inc., or which are traded in the over-the-counter market approved for margin by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Board provided that such securities; (i) are free from liens and encumbrances; (ii) represent no more than 5% of the issued and outstanding shares of any one issuer; and (iii) are valued at 75% of the market value thereof;

(e) *deliverable* warehouse receipts *for commodities traded on the Exchange provided that such receipts will be valued as margin at no more than 75% of the value of the commodity*; [provided that such warehouse receipts shall be valued in accordance with the following:

(i) if the warehouse receipt is for a deliverable grade of the commodity underlying either the futures contract sold or the futures contract which is the subject of the call options sold, not more than 90% of the value of the commodity may be considered as margin; and;

(ii) if the warehouse receipt is for a deliverable grade of the futures contract purchased or the put options sold, not more than 75% of the value of the commodity may be considered as margin; and;

(iii) if the warehouse receipt is for either: (A) deliverable grade of a commodity other than the commodity underlying the futures contract or option to be margined; or (B) a form of silver or gold not deliverable under a futures contract, then not more than 75% of the value of the warehouse receipt may be considered as margin.]

(f) physical commodities (but not forward contracts therefor) if the carrying member is in possession and control of negotiable documents covering such commodities, provided, however, that the value of such commodities shall be based upon the contract market price for the grade of such commodity or if the commodity is not of a grade deliverable on a contract market, then at the price for the grade of such commodity on the spot market;

(g) a letter of credit in favor of a clearing member carrying an account*, or in the case of any letter or credit to be used on a pass-through basis with the Clearing House a letter of credit in favor of the Exchange.  All letters of credit shall be* issued in such form as may be prescribed by the Exchange and by a depository which has been approved by the Exchange for issuance and confirmation of letters of credit drawn in favor of the Clearing Members *or in favor of the Exchange, as applicable.*

 (3) Calls issued by Member Firms for additional margin from customers may only be met by: deposits conforming to the requirements of Rule 4.01(E)(1) for open NYMEX Division positions, or conforming to the requirements of Rule 4.01(E)(2) for open COMEX Division positions, or, for open positions on either division of the Exchange, favorable market movements which, when taken into consideration and combined with any other monies available, enable the customer's margin to equal or exceed the then prevailing initial margin requirement.

 (F) Withdrawals of margin from a customer's account may only be permitted by a Member Firm carrying such account if the remaining funds in such account are equal to or in excess of the then prevailing initial margin required of the applicable open positions at the time of said withdrawal request.

(G) The customer's response to a margin call issued by a Member Firm must be timely and complete. A Member Firm may call, at any time, for margins above and beyond the minimums required by the Exchange. A Member Firm may liquidate any or all positions maintained by a customer for failure to meet a margin call. The customer will be liable for any loss or deficiency resulting therefrom.

 (H) The margin requirements established by the Board or its designee may vary for different commodities and may be changed from time to time by the Board or its designee, and in the discretion of the Board or its designee, may be made applicable to all open trades as well as new trades.

 (I) Arbitrage

(1) For the purposes of Exchange margin requirements, an arbitrage position is a purchase or sale of an Exchange futures contract in one delivery month which futures contract is offset by a futures contract to sell or to purchase a similar quantity of a related commodity in the same or different delivery month which offsetting futures contract is executed on or subject to the rules of a different exchange. In order to qualify as an arbitrage position, each contract long and short must be carried by the same member firm for the same account.

(2) The Board of Directors, by resolution, may identify those futures contracts, that are executable on and/or subject to the rules of a different exchange, which shall be deemed to qualify as part of an arbitrage position.

(3) The Board of Directors or its designee may set levels of margin for arbitrage positions at a rate less than applicable to outright positions; provided, however, that except for interdivision straddles, no such rate shall be lower than the rates established for clearing members' margins.


Rule 9.05. MARGINS

*	*	*	*
(E) Clearing Members may meet original margin calls by depositing:

(1) Cash (U.S. Currency);

(2) Original Margin Certificates issued by an original margin depository, in form acceptable to the Clearing House, for delivery to the order of the Clearing House, representing securities issued by the Department of Treasury of the United States of America maturing within ten (10) years from the date of the deposit and guaranteed as to principal and interest by the United States Government; such securities shall be valued at ninety five percent (95%) of the par value; or

(3) Subject to a maximum limit of 50% of the Clearing Member's total original margin obligations, Irrevocable Letters of Credit payable to the order of the Clearing House *including such Letters of Credit that are deposited with the Clearing Member in accordance with Exchange procedures by a customer*, in form acceptable to the Clearing House, issued by or confirmed by an original margin depository and having an expiration date of not less than three (3) or more than eighteen (18) months from the date of issuance; provided, however, that such Letter of Credit may not be used to meet original margin obligations during the fifteen calendar days prior to the expiration date thereof (if the fifteenth day prior to the expiration of the Letter of Credit is not a business day, the period during which such Letter of Credit may not be used to meet original margin obligations shall begin on the business day immediately preceding that day); and, provided further, that on the business d!
ay!
!
 preceding the fifteenth calendar day prior to the expiration of the Letter of Credit, the Clearing House shall issue a call for original margin to be deposited in a form and manner acceptable to the Clearing House for positions held open as of the close of business on that day and margined by the Letter of Credit. The Clearing House shall have the unqualified right to call on any Letter of Credit at any time prior to expiration.

CCA Rule 48. DEPOSIT OF SECURITIES AND LETTERS OF CREDIT A ORIGINAL MARGIN

(b) Irrevocable Letters of Credit.

(i)	The Corporation will accept as original margin for the full face amount thereof a letter of credit in favor of the Corporation issued by any institution selected by the depositor *including such Letters of Credit in favor of the Corporation that are deposited with the Clearing Member in accordance with Exchange procedures by a customer*, provided that

RE:
Reminder on Use of Money Market Funds as Original Margin Deposits on the NYMEX Division

DATE:
May 31, 2001
=============================This Notice is a reminder regarding certain rule changes and related policy guidelines that will go into effect on June 1, 2001 for the NYMEX Division.  The rule changes going into effect on June 1, 2001 on the NYMEX Division allow shares of certain money market mutual funds to be acceptable for purposes of original margin deposits.

Corresponding rule changes for the COMEX Division  have also been approved by the NYMEX Board of Directors and filed with the CFTC; the changes for the COMEX Division will be implemented at a later date.

	Rule Amendments
The amendments generally require that in order to be used for such purpose, a money market fund must be approved by the NYMEX Board and also must comply with CFTC Regulation ? 1.25.  For purposes of original margin, the Exchange's Clearing House will value such money market fund shares at 95% of their market value.  In addition, a Clearing Member's participation in any approved fund or any group of approved funds offered by the same issuer shall be limited to the greater of $250,000 or 25% of the Clearing Member's total original margin obligations. Finally, no more than 25% of the total assets of an approved money market mutual fund may be used to meet original margin obligations at the Exchange.

Exchange Policy on Money Market Funds
The NYMEX Board of Directors also recently adopted three additional guidelines that will be applicable to such funds. First, until further notice from the Exchange, the Board has determined to limit the number of money market funds available for this purpose to ten. Second, the Board will require that henceforth each fund applying for such status must have a minimum value of $5 billion.  Finally, each fund further must provide for same day payment if notification is made by 3:00 p.m. on that day.

If you have any questions concerning this change, please contact Bernard Purta, Senior Vice President, Regulatory Affairs and Operations, at (212) 299- 2380; Arthur McCoy, Vice President, Financial Surveillance Section, NYMEX Compliance Department, at (212) 299-2928; or Joseph Sanguedolce, Director, Financial Surveillance Section, NYMEX Compliance Department, at (212) 299-2855.

Re:
Proposed Give-Up Rules



	Attached please find proposed COMEX Rule 4.86A, ""Give Up Rules.""  Generally, this Rule seeks to outline the responsibilities for both clearing members and floor brokers with respect to the handling of give-up trades.  The recommendation for this Rule was approved by the Compliance Review Committee, the COMEX Governors Committee at its most recent meeting, as well as the NYMEX Board of Directors.  Additionally, a replicate version of this Rule has recently been approved for the NYMEX Division.

		Proposed Rule 4.86A affects a ""Special Matter"" under the terms of the COMEX By-Laws.  Accordingly, COMEX Division Members have ten (10) days to submit a petition signed by owners of at least 155 COMEX Division Memberships requesting a vote of the COMEX Division Members to disapprove the amendments, pursuant to the procedures set forth under COMEX By-Law 205(D).  If a petition is not received, or if the amendment is not disapproved, it will be submitted to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.  Implementation of the Rule is tentatively planned for August 1, 2001.

	If you have any questions concerning these procedures, please contact Thomas F. LaSala, Vice President, Compliance, at (212) 299-2897.




Rule 4.86A	Give-Up Trades

In the absence of a give-up agreement whose terms and conditions govern the responsibilities/obligations of executing brokers, customers and clearing members, the following rules shall define the respective responsibilities/obligations of those parties to an order.  The ""executing broker"", as used in this rule, is the registered billing entity, member firm or floor broker to whom the order is transmitted.

I.	Responsibilities/Obligations of Clearing Members

A.	Limits Placed by Clearing Member - A clearing member may, in its discretion, place trading limits on the trades it will accept for give-up for a customer's account from an executing broker, provided however, that the executing broker receives prior written or electronic notice from the clearing member of the limits.  Notice must be received by the executing broker in a timely manner.  A copy of such notice shall be retained by the clearing member.

B.	Trade Rejection.  A clearing member may reject (""DK"") a trade only if:  (1) the trade exceeds the trading limits established under Section I(A) of this rule for that customer and it has been communicated to the executing broker as described in Section I(A); or (2) the trade is an error for which the executing broker is responsible.  If a clearing member has a basis for rejecting a trade, and chooses to do so in accordance with the provisions of Rule 2.21(B), it must notify the executing broker promptly.

C.	Billing.  The clearing member will pay all floor brokerage fees incurred for all transactions executed by the executing broker for the customer and subsequently accepted by the clearing member by means of the ATOM system.  Floor brokerage fees will be agreed upon in advance among the clearing member, customer and the executing broker.

II.	Responsibilities/Obligations of Executing Members

A. 	Customer Order Placement.  An executing broker will be responsible for determining that all orders are placed or authorized by the customer.  Once an order has been accepted, a broker or his clerk must:  (1) confirm the terms of the order with the customer; (2) accurately execute the order according to its terms; (3) confirm the execution of the order to the customer as soon as practicable; and (4) transmit such executed order to the clearing member as soon as practicable in accordance with Exchange Rules.

B.	Use of Other Persons.  Unless otherwise agreed in writing, the executing broker is allowed to use the services of another broker in connection with his/her obligations under these rules.  The executing broker remains responsible to the customer and clearing member under these rules.

C.	Executing Broker Responsibility for Verifying Clearing Member Authorization.  Prior to a broker accepting and executing an initial order for any new customer account, the executing broker must confirm with the clearing member by telephonic, electronic or written means, that:  1) the customer has a valid account with the clearing member; 2) the account number; 3) the brokerage rate; 4) the customer is authorized by the clearing member to place orders with the executing broker for that account; and 5) a listing or summary of persons authorized to place orders for that account.  The executing broker must retain a copy of the authorization or the specifics of the telephonic confirmation, which includes:  opposite party, date, time, and any other relevant information.  The falsification of such information shall be the basis for disciplinary action.

D.	Rejection of Customer Order.  Where an executing broker has confirmed clearing member authorization to execute orders on behalf of a customer in accordance with Rule 4.86A, the broker may, in his discretion, reject an order that the customer transmits to the broker for execution.  The broker shall promptly notify the customer and the clearing member(s) of any such rejection."

RE:
Revised Implementation Date for New NYMEX Rule 9.11A (""Give-Up Trades"")

DATE:
May 16, 2001
=============================Previously, in Notice to Members #01-154, the Exchange stated that new NYMEX Rule 9.11A
(""Give-Up Trades"") would go into effect on June 1, 2001.  The Exchange is revising the implementation timeframe in order to provide Floor Members and Member Firms with additional time to obtain necessary records and become compliant with the requirements.  Accordingly, please be advised that this rule now will go into effect beginning on the trade date of August 1, 2001.	Further, it is anticipated that a similar rule will be implemented for the COMEX Division following final review and approval by the COMEX Governors Committee.

!	In the absence of an applicable give-up agreement, new Rule 9.11A will define the respective responsibilities/obligations to an order of executing brokers, customers and Clearing Members.

!	The term ""executing broker"" as used in Rule 9.11A refers to the registered billing entity, Member Firm or Floor Broker to whom the order is transmitted.

!	Rule 9.11 will provide that, in the absence of an applicable give-up agreement, a Clearing Member may reject a trade only if: (1) the trade exceeds trading limits established by the Clearing Member for that customer that have been communicated to the executing broker as provided by the rule or (2) the trade is an error for which the executing broker is responsible.

!	The new rule also places affirmative obligations on executing brokers to confirm Clearing Member authorization for an account.  For example, prior to an executing broker accepting and executing an initial order for any new customer account, such executing broker must confirm with the Clearing Member by telephonic, electronic or written means, that:
(a)	the customer has a valid account with the Clearing Member;
(b)	the account number;
(c)	the brokerage rate;
(d)	the customer is authorized by the Clearing Member to place orders with the executing broker for that account; and
(e)	a listing or summary of persons authorized to place orders for that account.
Moreover, the executing broker must retain a copy of the authorization or the specifics of the telephonic confirmation, which includes: opposite party, date, time, and any other relevant information.  The Compliance Department will conduct periodic audits of such records, and falsification of such information shall be the basis for disciplinary action.

If you have any questions concerning this new rule, please contact Bernard Purta, Senior Vice President, Regulatory Affairs and Operations, at (212) 299- 2380; Thomas LaSala, Vice President, NYMEX Compliance Department, at (212) 299-2897; or Arthur McCoy, Vice President, Financial Surveillance Section, NYMEX Compliance Department, at (212) 299-2928,

Rule 9.11A	Give-Up Trades

In the absence of a give-up agreement whose terms and conditions govern the responsibilities/obligations of executing brokers, customers and Clearing Members, the following rules shall define the respective responsibilities/obligations of those parties to an order.

Notice must be received by the executing broker in a timely manner.  A copy of such notice shall be retained by the Clearing Member.

(2).	Trade Rejection.  A Clearing Member may reject (""DK"") a trade only if:  (1) the trade exceeds the trading limits established under Section I(A) of this rule for that customer and it has been communicated to the executing broker as described in Subsection (A); or (2) the trade is an error for which the executing broker is responsible.  If a Clearing Member has a basis for rejecting a trade, and chooses to do so in accordance with the provisions of Rule 2.21(B), it must notify the executing broker promptly.

(3).	Billing.  A Clearing Member will pay all floor brokerage fees incurred for all transactions executed by the executing broker for the customer and subsequently accepted by the Clearing Member by means of the ATOM system.

4.	Rejection of Customer Order.  Where an executing broker has confirmed Clearing Member authorization to execute orders on behalf of a customer in accordance with this Rule 9.11A, the broker may, in the broker's discretion, reject an order that the customer transmits to the broker for execution.

,04/07/2000,,office.chairman@enron.com,all.worldwide@enron.com,,Enron Net Works,"It is becoming increasingly clear that the development of eCommerce will have 
a significant and continuing impact on the conduct of business in a broad 
array of industries.  Through EnronOnLine, Enron has quickly become a major 
catalyst for the transition to the web in the gas and electric industries.  
EnronOnLine has been an enormous success since its launch.  Since launch, we 
have completed 67,043 transactions on line, with a total dollar value of over 
$25 billion.  EnronOnLine is now the largest eCommerce site in the world.

We believe that the competitive success of EnronOnLine is due to one very 
specific reason.  In addition to providing a web-based platform for 
transactions, Enron acts as principal to provide direct liquidity to the 
site.  We stand ready at all times, in any market conditions, to buy and sell 
at the posted price.  This converts a &bulletin board8 (the more typical 
eCommerce concept) into a true market.  There are very few, if any, 
competitors that can provide this capability.

We are increasingly convinced that this competitive advantage can be 
dramatically expanded to other products and other geographies.  If we are 
correct, this could provide an enormous new opportunity for growth for Enron.

Accordingly, we are initiating a major new effort to capture this 
opportunity.  Effective today we are creating a new business, Enron Net 
Works, to pursue new market development opportunities in eCommerce across a 
broad range of industries.  It is likely that this business will ultimately 
be our fifth business segment, joining transmission & distribution, 
wholesale, retail and broadband services.

Included in this business will be our entire IT and technology group along 
with significant talent and resources in market making and finance.  
Initially, North America will provide primary direct support for staff 
services and back office, however, over time we will be requesting support 
services from virtually all Enron units to ensure continued growth and 
success.  To facilitate the combining of commercial capabilities with these 
new eCommerce platforms, Enron Net Works will work closely with the merchant 
functions of North America, Europe, South America, CALME, Asia and Broadband.

Enron Net Works will be headed by Greg Whalley, Chief Executive Officer; Mike 
McConnell, Chief Operating Officer; and Jeff McMahon, Chief Commercial 
Officer.  These individuals will comprise the Office of the Chairman for 
Enron Net Works and remain on the Executive Committee of Enron Corp.  
Replacing Greg Whalley as President and Chief Operating Officer of Enron 
North America is Dave Delainey, who will also join Enron,s Executive 
Committee.

Global Technology will remain intact but will now be a part of Enron Net 
Works.  It will maintain all of the same businesses and services as it did as 
an Enron global function.  Philippe Bibi will remain the Chief Technology 
Officer for all of Enron Corp. and continues to be responsible for the 
development of worldwide technology standards and platforms.

EnronOnLine, headed by Louise Kitchen, will also remain intact and will now 
be a part of Enron Net Works.  The success of EnronOnLine enables us to 
utilize this site as a model as we explore other markets. In addition, the 
following individuals are included in Enron Net Works along with their 
current eCommerce initiatives: Harry Arora, Public Financial Securities; Jay 
Fitzgerald, New Markets Identification; Bruce Garner, Metals; and Greg Piper, 
Pulp and Paper.

Over the next several weeks we will complete staffing and organizational 
design and will provide full details on this exciting new business 
opportunity."

we some of the less-experienced credit folks, when we receive a worksheet 
from them where the counterparty is a limited partnership, it may be 
advisable to ask them the following questions:

1. Should the GP be designated as a Specified Entity?  The alternative may be 
to require the GP to sign a Guaranty and then they would become a credit 
support provider.  By making the GP a Specified Entity, they get picked up in 
the cross default, bankruptcy and credit event upon merger provisions.

2. Should there be an additional termination event or event of default that 
gets triggered if the GP fails to be the GP of the limited partnership?

3. Whose financials are they expecting to receive, the GP's or the LP's?

4. If there are financial tests, who do they pertain to, the GP or the LP?

5. How does the LP qualify as an ESP?  Particularly with some of the less 
experienced credit folks who have not had to deal with this issue on the 
physical side, maybe this question should always be asked for every 
counterparty just to be safe.

I know that there is a whole bunch of you on the receiving end of this EMail
and we haven't seen or spoken to some in quite awhile but know this -- we are
thinking of you and your families!!  Our little (big?) Luke turned 4 months
today so I thought I would share some photos with all of you.  Although we 
have
been guilty of not staying in touch, I hope that the attached photos will 
allow
us to somewhat catch up with you.  It is certainly all about Luke on this end
of the line.  He is happy, healthy and so is Mom and Dad.  Here is hoping that
all is well on your end.  We hope to see everyone soon again some day but 
until
then we wish everyone all the best!

Love,

Todd, Rena, and Luke
