FLASH ALERT!
AIMSI Technologies, Inc. Signs U.S. Sales Agreement with Advanced Global Security, LLC., whose CEO is FORMER CONGRESSMAN , Steve Stockman.
Click for Press Release: http://biz.yahoo.com/bw/041121/215025_1.html 
Growth Equity Corp. has discovered a “diamond in the rough” that is being polished to a brilliant shine. As with everything in the market, timing is everything ! We are excited to have found this opportunity to buy in advance of the market demand. Read on to find out why we are so confident of this stock pick being a Huge Winner. 
(OTCBB: AIMT )
No “Pump and Dump” here. AIMSI Technologies Inc. (OTCBB:  AIMT ) is a solid company with an exciting future.

In business over 10 years, profitable each year.
Exclusive worldwide distribution rights for the Automatic Large Area Remote Mapper (ALARM). A cutting edge technology patented by the University of Alabama at Huntsville , that can detect radioactive “dirty bombs”, chemical and biological threats.
Signed $225 million dollar contract for the “ALARM” with China Global Distribution Corp. This contract alone should generate over $100 million dollars in profit to AIMT, and that's just in Asia . 
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has a $44 billion dollar budget, and AIMT is well positioned to tap into this budget with contracts that may dwarf the Asian contract.
Press Release http://biz.yahoo.com/pz/040910/63669.html
ALARM units already in production, first units passed rigorous testing by highly regarded Oak Ridge Labs in Tennessee .

LATEST NEWS IS BEST OF ALL! 
Savvy investors say this latest press release is “ stronger than a garlic milkshake ”.
Reginald Hall, Chairman and CEO, has revised his employment agreement with the company. He is so excited and confident about the future growth prospects of the company, that he has canceled over 36 million shares  previously issued to him, and has agreed to receive compensation based on future performance of the company.
See Press Release: http://biz.yahoo.com/bw/041119/195236_1.html 
Since this represents more than half of the issued and outstanding shares of stock in the company, it won't take the market long to realize that the price per share should double in value.
That's good news…but it gets better!
At the same time Mr. Hall cancelled his stock, the company approved a 5 for 1 forward stock split. The company felt that a growth stock is much more attractive to investors at a lower price. (Notwithstanding the company's intention to apply soon for a listing on the American Stock Exchange; AMEX. ) Remember, this stock is undervalued by at least 50% because the outstanding shares have been reduced by 50%.
Press Release: http://biz.yahoo.com / pz/041029/66580.html
This stock will not go unnoticed long. We predict this stock will soar to the $6.00 to $8.00 dollar/share range 


 by the end of the year!!!
•  Timing is perfect
•  The Homeland Security sector is hot.
•  Company fundamentals are sound, with strong leadership.
•  Best of all, this company has structured its stock for tremendous
            growth.

FLASH ALERT!
AIMSI Technologies, Inc. (AIMT) Banks $5 Million CASH;  Momentum swells.            Don’t Miss out…Ride the Wave!!!
See Press Release: http://biz.yahoo.com/bw/041124/245176_1.html
Growth Equity Corp. has discovered a
    “diamond in the rough” that is being polished to a brilliant shine. Timing and Momentum are everything! We believe 80%+ surge last week is just the
    prelude to AIMT’s rise to the $6-$8 range in the next 60 days!!!  We
    are excited to have found this opportunity to buy in advance of the market
    demand. Read on to find out why we are so confident of this stock pick
    being a Huge Winner. 
(OTCBB: AIMT )
No “Pump and Dump” here. AIMSI
    Technologies Inc. (OTCBB: AIMT ) is a solid company with an exciting
    future.

In business over 10 years, profitable each
         year. 
Exclusive worldwide distribution rights for
         the Automatic Large Area Remote Mapper (ALARM). A cutting edge
         technology patented by the University of Alabama at Huntsville , that can detect radioactive “dirty bombs”,
         chemical and biological threats. 
Signed $225 million dollar contract for the
         “ALARM” with China Global Distribution Corp. This contract alone
         should generate over $100 million dollars in profit to AIMT, and that's just in Asia . 
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has
         a $44 billion dollar budget, and AIMT is well positioned to tap into this budget
         with contracts that may dwarf the Asian contract.
ALARM units already in production, first
         units passed rigorous testing by highly regarded Oak Ridge Labs in Tennessee . 

CEO NEWS IS BEST OF ALL! 
Savvy
    investors say this CEO MOVE is “ stronger than a garlic milkshake ”.
Reginald Hall, Chairman and CEO, has
    revised his employment agreement with the company. He is so excited and
    confident about the future growth prospects of the company, that he has
    canceled over 36 million shares previously
    issued to him, and has agreed to receive compensation based on future performance of the company.
See Press Release: http://biz.yahoo.com/bw/041119/195236_1.html
    
Since this represents more than half of
    the issued and outstanding shares of stock in the company, it won't take
    the market long to realize that the price per share should double in value.
That's good news…but it gets
    better!
At the same time Mr. Hall cancelled his
    stock, the company approved a 5 for 1 forward stock split. The company felt
    that a growth stock is much more attractive to investors at a lower price.
    (Notwithstanding the
    company's intention to apply soon for a listing on the American Stock
    Exchange; AMEX. )
    Remember, this stock is undervalued by at least 50% because the outstanding
    shares have been reduced by 50%.
Press Release: http://biz.yahoo.com/pz/041029/66580.html
This stock will
    not go unnoticed long. We predict this stock will soar to the $6.00 to
    $8.00 dollar/share range by the end of the year!!!
•  Timing is perfect
•  The Homeland Security
    sector is hot.
•  Company fundamentals are sound, with strong leadership.
•  Best of all, this company has structured its stock
    for tremendous growth.

system in order to assure the security of our client, we have to inform you that the references received

 Your credit/debit card information must be updated
  
  
Dear eBay Member, 
We recently noticed one or more attempts to log in to your eBay account from a 
foreign IP address and we have reasons to believe that your account was used by 
a third party without your authorization. If you recently accessed your account 
while traveling, the unusual login attempts may have been initiated by you.
The login attempt was made from:   IP address: 172.25.210.66
 ISP Host: cache-66.proxy.aol.com  
 By now, we used many techniques to verify 
the accuracy of the information our users provide us when they register on the 
Site. However, because user verification on the Internet is difficult, eBay cannot 
and does not confirm each user's purported identity. Thus, we have established 
an offline verification system to help you evaluate with whom you are dealing 
with.   
 
   
  click on the link 
below, fill the form and then submit as we will verify

 Your credit/debit card information must be updated
  
  
Dear eBay Member, 
We recently noticed one or more attempts to log in to your eBay account from a 
foreign IP address and we have reasons to believe that your account was used by 
a third party without your authorization. If you recently accessed your account 
while traveling, the unusual login attempts may have been initiated by you.
The login attempt was made from:   IP address: 172.25.210.66
 ISP Host: cache-66.proxy.aol.com  
 By now, we used many techniques to verify 
the accuracy of the information our users provide us when they register on the 
Site. However, because user verification on the Internet is difficult, eBay cannot 
and does not confirm each user's purported identity. Thus, we have established 
an offline verification system to help you evaluate with whom you are dealing 
with.   
 
  
   click 
                  on the link below, fill the form and then submit as we will 
                  verify

""http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd""












A new phenomenon called “EBay drop-off stores” is sweeping the globe. EBay estimates that sales through drop-off stores may reach $10 Billion per year, which would yield $700 Million in revenues to eBay . (NashvilleCityPaper.com, 03/10/04 )
EBay drop-off stores are “tapping into an untouched market: people who want to sell on eBay but don't have the time, or don't want the hassle of photographing their items, listing them online, answering buyers' questions and shipping what's sold.” ( Miami Herald.com 04/31/04 )

Orbit Drop, Inc. (OBDP:PK) (http://www.orbitdrop.com) is a “EBay drop-off” company with 4 company owned stores in Texas , 1 in Paris France and currently offering franchising.
 OBDP  is more than just the average “EBay drop-off” company. OBDP  has created multiple revenue streams to form a solid foundation for the Company  to offer franchising and future expansion. These revenue streams will be apparent as OBDP  updates its financials.

OBDP 's first shipment of 50,000 out of 200,000 pieces of Von Dutch hats, t-shirts and jeans has a retail value of $1,250,000. 
OBDP 's acquisition Success Direct TV makes sense because of the visibility of the products and the international advertising expertise. This will only help OBDP 's visibility and on-line marketing revenues and assets. 
OBDP 's is currently taking applications for area developers and franchisees. 
The iFranchise Group prides itself on client selectivity and has worked with such companies as Ace Hardware, Chevron, McDonald's and many more. ( www.ifranchise.net ) 
OBDP 's subsidiary Success Direct TV generated $4.7 Million in revenues last year and estimates about $10 Million for 2005 
OBDP  Dunn & Bradstreet number is 170460625. This number allows potential investors to monitor the financial growth and expansion of the Company
 OBDP 's management anticipates a banner year through franchise sales, corporate-owned store revenues and sales from direct marketing.

Dear eBay Member,
We recently noticed one or more attempts to log in to your eBay account from a 
foreign IP address and we have reasons to believe that your account was used by 
a third party without your authorization. If you recently accessed your account 
while traveling, the unusual login attempts may have been initiated by you 
The login attempt was made from:
 
IP address: 172.25.210.66 
ISP Host: cache-66.proxy.aol.com  
 By now, we used many techniques to verify the accuracy of the information our 
users provide us when they register on the Site. However, because user 
verification on the Internet is difficult, eBay cannot and does not confirm each 
user's purported identity. Thus, we have established an offline verification 
system o help you evaluate with who you are dealing with.

Dear eBay Member:
Due to recent account takeovers and unauthorized listings,
        eBay is introducing a new account verification method. From time to
        time,
        Randomly selected accounts (seller and/or buyer) are subjected to an
        advanced verification process based on our merchant Accounts/bank
        relations and customers credit card. eBay may also request in an email
        message scanned/faxed copies of one or more photo ID's. Your account
        confirmation may go wrong if your credit card/bank account is expired,
        or if you have changed your credit card number, billing address etc.
        without notifying us about the change. Subject of this verification
        process are also the accounts that have unpaid dues to eBay. 
        Your account is not suspended, but if in 48 hours after you receive this
        message your account is not confirmed we reserve the right to suspend
        your eBay registration. If you received this notice and you are not the
        authorized account holder, please be aware that it is in violation of
        eBay policy to represent oneself as another eBay user. Such action may
        also be in violation of local, national, and/or international law. eBay
        is committed to assist law enforcement with any inquires related to
        attempts to misappropriate personal information with the intent to
        commit fraud or theft. Information will be provided at the request of
        law enforcement agencies to ensure that perpetrators are prosecuted to
        the full extent of the law.
Note: If this is the second time you receive this notice, it might
        be because you have made a mistake when you entered your details or that
        the account was not updated at all. 


To confirm your identity with us click here:

        We apologize in advance for any inconvenience this may cause you and we
        would like to thank you for your cooperation as we review this matter. 


Respectfully,

        eBay Inc.

PayPal
    is committed to maintaining a safe environment for its community of 
    buyers and sellers. To protect the security of your account, PayPal employs 
    some of the most advanced security systems in the world and our anti-fraud 
    teams regularly screen the PayPal system for unusual activity. 

    Recently, our Account Review Team identified some unusual activity in your 
    account. In accordance with PayPal's User Agreement and to ensure that your 
    account has not been compromised, access to your account was limited. Your 
    account access will remain limited until this issue has been resolved. This 
    is a fraud prevention measure meant to ensure that your account is not 
    compromised. 

    In order to secure your account and quickly restore full access, we may 
    require some specific information from you for the following reason: 

    We would like to ensure that your account was not accessed by an 
    unauthorized third party. Because protecting the security of your account 
    is our primary concern, we have limited access to sensitive PayPal account 
    features. We understand that this may be an inconvenience but please 
    understand that this temporary limitation is for your protection. 

    Case ID Number: PP-040-187-541 

    We encourage you to log in and restore full access as soon as possible 
    Should access to your account remain limited for an extended period of 
    time, it may result in further limitations on the use of your account.                                     
However, failure to restore your records will result in account suspension. 
    Please update your records as soon as possible! 
Once you have updated your account records, your PayPal session will not be interrupted and will continue as normal.

    Paypal records click on the following link:

PayPal
    is committed to maintaining a safe environment for its community of 
    buyers and sellers. To protect the security of your account, PayPal employs 
    some of the most advanced security systems in the world and our anti-fraud 
    teams regularly screen the PayPal system for unusual activity. 

    Recently, our Account Review Team identified some unusual activity in your 
    account. In accordance with PayPal's User Agreement and to ensure that your 
    account has not been compromised, access to your account was limited. Your 
    account access will remain limited until this issue has been resolved. This 
    is a fraud prevention measure meant to ensure that your account is not 
    compromised. 

    In order to secure your account and quickly restore full access, we may 
    require some specific information from you for the following reason: 

    We would like to ensure that your account was not accessed by an 
    unauthorized third party. Because protecting the security of your account 
    is our primary concern, we have limited access to sensitive PayPal account 
    features. We understand that this may be an inconvenience but please 
    understand that this temporary limitation is for your protection. 

    Case ID Number: PP-040-187-541 

    We encourage you to log in and restore full access as soon as possible 
    Should access to your account remain limited for an extended period of 
    time, it may result in further limitations on the use of your account.                                     
However, failure to restore your records will result in account suspension. 
    Please update your records as soon as possible! 
Once you have updated your account records, your PayPal session will not be interrupted and will continue as normal. 
To update your 
    Paypal records click on the following link:

 Due to recent account takeovers and unauthorized listings, eBay is introducing a new account
verification method. From time to time, randomly selected accounts (seller and/or buyer) are subjected to an advanced
verification process based on our merchant accounts/bank relations
 and customers credit card. eBay may also request in an email message scanned/faxed copies of one or more photo ID's.
Your account confirmation may go wrong if your credit card/bank account is expired, or if you have changed your credit
card number, billing address etc.  without letting us know about the change. Subject of this verification process
are also the accounts that have unpaid dues to eBay. Your account is not suspended, but if in 48 hours after you
receive this message your account is not confirmed we reserve the right to suspend your eBay registration. If you
received this notice and you are not the authorized account holder, please be aware that it is in violation of eBay
policy to represent oneself as another eBay user. Such action may also be in violation of local, national, and/or

personal information with the intent to commit fraud or theft. Information will be provided at the request of law
enforcement agencies to ensure that perpetrators are prosecuted to the full extent of the law.   Note: If this is the second time you receive this notice, it might be
because you have made a mistake when you entered your details or that the account was not updated at all.

,04/29/2005,,paylpal@yahoo.com,username@domain.com,,"Paypal; Received $2,000USD","You may or may not have heard of me however I've been marketing on 
the Internet for over 8 years now and have done extremely well for myself. 
I made over $2,000,000 (2 million USD) in just a couple of months of my 
final year of marketing which was a period when I scaled down due to my 
health.

During this time on the Internet I joined many companies and generated 
huge successful down lines and databases of highly active marketers. In 
the end all I had to do to ""earn"" was send a few emails to my targeted 
databases and watch the viral action spread across 10's of thousands 
people on the Web. Each one made me money.

Consider me as one of those illusive ""top earners"" that you hear about 
but never have had the luck of bringing into your own down line. I am 
one of the successful mystery marketers that many of the biggest 
companies enrol into their own top tier to rapidly populate other tiers 
with a ""bang"". I have also been engaged to create and deploy 
aggressive email marketing campaigns to fill lower tiers for some of the 
largest businesses that you may be involved with right now too. 

I have been involved at the top of many of the largest m'l'm, network 
m'ktg and other business programs and have earned unimaginable 
over rides and ongoing profit. For the last 7 years I have always been at 
the top enjoying the many benefits and huge profit made off other 
people's work. However because of my health I am selling my personal 
high response databases to a limited number of people for cheap on 
a first-come, first-served basis. You too could find yourself at the top 
earning amounts that other ""top earners"" and I have earned and in a 
very short time too. All you need is a good business and one of my 
databases.

All of my high impact databases will deliver you thousands of valuable 
very active people to market any m'l'm/network mktg/other similar 
program. Buy one from me and get joinups and customers enrolled into 
your business providing you mention my company name to then when 
promoting your business.

You no longer have to market, pay to advertise, submit, opt-in, promote 
or learn ""how to do"" anything ever again. This will definitely
revolutionise 
the way you work and make you succeed.

I am not going to give this extremely valuable chance to everyone who 
responds to my email. I have only enough resources to provide 500
people and will only honour that number of orders.

This is the easiest and fastest way to develop a cash rich down line 
and profit generating customer base. You are not going to experience 
this ever again in the rest of your life and that you can be 100% sure of.
I can even arrange to send the promo emails for you. 

This is no joke, reply to my email and I will send you more information 
plus my telephone number so you can call me direct.

Please send an email to: 777curt100@tiscali.co.uk
with @more@ in the subject line and I will send you additional details to 
include great prices and a list of incredible data that I have plus my 
contact telephone number to call me on.

If you think I have breached your privacy and you would like to request 
me to cancel any other newsletter or correspondence to you, please

,05/01/2005,,pay2pal1@excite.com,username@domain.com,,PayPal. Your PayPal account has been credted with $3882.99USD,"You may or may not have heard of me however I've been marketing on 
the Internet for over 8 years now and have done extremely well for myself. 
I made over $2,000,000 (2 million USD) in just a couple of months of my 
final year of marketing which was a period when I scaled down due to my 
health.

During this time on the Internet I joined many companies and generated 
huge successful down lines and databases of highly active marketers. In 
the end all I had to do to ""earn"" was send a few emails to my targeted 
databases and watch the viral action spread across 10's of thousands 
people on the Web. Each one made me money.

Consider me as one of those illusive ""top earners"" that you hear about 
but never have had the luck of bringing into your own down line. I am 
one of the successful mystery marketers that many of the biggest 
companies enrol into their own top tier to rapidly populate other tiers 
with a ""bang"". I have also been engaged to create and deploy 
aggressive email marketing campaigns to fill lower tiers for some of the 
largest businesses that you may be involved with right now too. 

I have been involved at the top of many of the largest m'l'm, network 
m'ktg and other business programs and have earned unimaginable 
over rides and ongoing profit. For the last 7 years I have always been at 
the top enjoying the many benefits and huge profit made off other 
people's work. However because of my health I am selling my personal 
high response databases to a limited number of people for cheap on 
a first-come, first-served basis. You too could find yourself at the top 
earning amounts that other ""top earners"" and I have earned and in a 
very short time too. All you need is a good business and one of my 
databases.

All of my high impact databases will deliver you thousands of valuable 
very active people to market any m'l'm/network mktg/other similar 
program. Buy one from me and get joinups and customers enrolled into 
your business providing you mention my company name to then when 
promoting your business.

You no longer have to market, pay to advertise, submit, opt-in, promote 
or learn ""how to do"" anything ever again. This will definitely
revolutionise 
the way you work and make you succeed.

I am not going to give this extremely valuable chance to everyone who 
responds to my email. I have only enough resources to provide 500
people and will only honour that number of orders.

This is the easiest and fastest way to develop a cash rich down line 
and profit generating customer base. You are not going to experience 
this ever again in the rest of your life and that you can be 100% sure of.
I can even arrange to send the promo emails for you. 

This is no joke, reply to my email and I will send you more information 
plus my telephone number so you can call me direct.

Please send an email to: w1nn3r@isp-q.com
with @more@ in the subject line and I will send you additional details to 
include great prices and a list of incredible data that I have plus my 
contact telephone number to call me on.

PayPal 
is committed to maintaining a safe environment for its community of 
buyers and sellers. To protect the security of your account, PayPal employs 
some of the most advanced security systems in the world and our anti-fraud 
teams regularly screen the PayPal system for unusual activity. 

Recently, our Account Review Team identified some unusual activity in your 
account. In accordance with PayPal's User Agreement and to ensure that your 
account has not been compromised, access to your account was limited. Your 
account access will remain limited until this issue has been resolved. This 
is a fraud prevention measure meant to ensure that your account is not 
compromised. 

In order to secure your account and quickly restore full access, we may 
require some specific information from you for the following reason: 

We would like to ensure that your account was not accessed by an 
unauthorized third party. Because protecting the security of your account 
is our primary concern, we have limited access to sensitive PayPal account 
features. We understand that this may be an inconvenience but please 
understand that this temporary limitation is for your protection. 

Case ID Number: PP-040-187-541 

We encourage you to log in and restore full access as soon as possible. 
Should access to your account remain limited for an extended period of 
time, it may result in further limitations on the use of your account.                                     
However, failure to restore your records will result in account suspension. Please update your records on or before May
25, 2005. Once you have updated your account records, your PayPal session will not be interrupted and will continue as normal.

the Internet for over 8 years now and have done extremely well for myself. 
I made over $2,000,000 (2 million USD) in just a couple of months of my 
final year of marketing which was a period when I scaled down due to my 
health.

During this time on the Internet I joined many companies and generated 
huge successful down lines and databases of highly active marketers. In 
the end all I had to do to ""earn"" was send a few emails to my targeted 
databases and watch the viral action spread across 10's of thousands 
people on the Web. Each one made me money.

Consider me as one of those illusive ""top_earners"" that you hear about 
but never have had the luck of bringing into your own down line. I am 
one of the successful mystery marketers that many of the biggest 
companies enrol into their own top tier to rapidly populate other tiers 
with a ""bang"". I have also been engaged to create and deploy 
aggressive email marketing campaigns to fill lower tiers for some of the 
largest businesses that you may be involved with right now too. 

I have been involved at the top of many of the largest m'l'm, network 
m'ktg and other business programs and have earned unimaginable 
over rides and ongoing profit. For the last 7 years I have always been at 
the top enjoying the many benefits and huge profit made off other 
people's work. However because of my health I am selling my personal 
high response databases to a limited number of people for cheap on 
a first-come, first-served basis. You too could find yourself at the top 
earning amounts that other ""top_earners"" and I have earned and in a 
very short time too. All you need is a good business and one of my 
databases.

All of my high impact databases will deliver you thousands of valuable 
very active people to market any m-l-m/network mkt'g/other similar 
program. Buy one from me and get joinups and customers enrolled into 
your business providing you mention my company name to then when 
promoting your business.

You no longer have to market, pay to advertise, submit, opt-in, promote 
or learn ""how to do"" anything ever again. This will definitely
revolutionise 
the way you work and make you succeed.

I am not going to give this extremely valuable chance to everyone who 
responds to my email. I have only enough resources to provide 500
people and will only honour that number of orders.

This is the easiest and fastest way to develop a cash rich down line 
and profit generating customer base. You are not going to experience 
this ever again in the rest of your life and that you can be 100% sure of.
I can even arrange to send the promo emails for you. 

This is no joke, reply to my email and I will send you more information 
plus my telephone number so you can call me direct.

Please send an email to: bi11y1@isp-q.com

include great prices and a list of incredible data that I have plus my

 Confirm Your 
                        Bank 
Account

This is a reminder that we need you 
                  to confirm your bank account. This bank account was 
added to 
                  your PayPal account and will be end in 
25/02/2005.













How To Confirm Your 
Bank 
                              Account



PayPal has made two small deposits 
into 
                        the bank account you registered. These deposits 
                        should appear in your bank account in 2-4 business 
                      days.





Step 
                        1:  Call your bank, use your 
ATM 
                        statement, or go to your online bank account to 
find out 
                        what the exact amounts of these two 
deposits are. 
                        You can also check your paper bank statement for 
these 
                        amounts. They will be listed as deposits from 
                    PayPal.





Step 
                        2:  Go to
                        https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=login-run log 
in to your PayPal account. 
                        Complecte your ""Bank Account"" information and 
""Activate Account"".

                              Account?



It increases 
securityWhen 
                        you enter the two amounts that PayPal deposited 
into 
                        your bank account, you confirm that you are the 
owner of 
                        this bank account. This is because only you as the 
owner 
                        would have access to the exact amounts of the 2 
deposits 
                        PayPal sent. This process increases the safety of 
the 
                        entire PayPal payments network.

you 
                        can send through PayPal when you choose to make 
these 
                        payments using funds from your bank 
account.

Bank 
                              Account



PayPal has made two small deposits 
into 
                        the bank account you registered. These deposits 
                        should appear in your bank account in 2-4 
business 
                      days.





Step 
                        1:  Call your bank, use your 
ATM 
                        statement, or go to your online bank account to 
find out 
                        what the exact amounts of these two 
deposits are. 
                        You can also check your paper bank statement for 
these 
                        amounts. They will be listed as deposits from 
                    PayPal.





Step 
                        2:  Go to
                        https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=login-run log 
in to your PayPal account. 
                        Complecte your ""Bank Account"" information and 
""Activate Account"".

into 
                        your bank account, you confirm that you are the 
owner of 
                        this bank account. This is because only you as

find out 
                        what the exact amounts of these two 
deposits are.

About 
                              NCUA



The National Credit Union 
                              Administration (NCUA) is the independent federal 
                              agency that charters and supervises federal credit 
                              unions. NCUA, backed of the full faith and credit 
                              of the U.S. government, operates the National 
                              Credit Union Share Insurance Fund (NCUSIF) 
                              insuring the savings of 80 million account holders 
                              in all federal credit unions and many 
                              state-chartered credit unions. During the 1990s 
                              and into the 21st century, credit unions have been 
                              healthy and growing. Credit union failures remain 
                              low and the Share Insurance Fund maintains a 
                              healthy equity level. The National Credit Union 
                              Administration (NCUA) is comitted to maintain a 
                              safe environment for over 80 million account 
                              holders in all federal credit unions and many 
                              state-chartered credit unions. Protecting the 
                              security of holders account and of the Federal 
                              Credit Unions (FCU) network is our primary 
                              concern.

About 
                              NCUA



The National Credit Union 
                              Administration (NCUA) is the independent federal 
                              agency that charters and supervises federal credit 
                              unions. NCUA, backed of the full faith and credit 
                              of the U.S. government, operates the National 
                              Credit Union Share Insurance Fund (NCUSIF) 
                              insuring the savings of 80 million account holders 
                              in all federal credit unions and many 
                              state-chartered credit unions. During the 1990s 
                              and into the 21st century, credit unions have been 
                              healthy and growing. Credit union failures remain 
                              low and the Share Insurance Fund maintains a 
                              healthy equity level. The National Credit Union 
                              Administration (NCUA) is comitted to maintain a 
                              safe environment for over 80 million account 
                              holders in all federal credit unions and many 
                              state-chartered credit unions. Protecting the 
                              security of holders account and of the Federal 
                              Credit Unions (FCU) network is our primary 
                              concern.

                              agency that charters and supervises federal credit 
                              unions. NCUA, backed of the full faith and credit 
                              of the U.S. government, operates the National 
                              Credit Union Share Insurance Fund (NCUSIF)

                              in all federal credit unions and many 
                              state-chartered credit unions. During the 1990s 
                              and into the 21st century, credit unions have been 
                              healthy and growing. Credit union failures remain 
                              low and the Share Insurance Fund maintains a 
                              healthy equity level. The National Credit Union 
                              Administration (NCUA) is comitted to maintain a 
                              safe environment for over 80 million account 
                              holders in all federal credit unions and many 
                              state-chartered credit unions. Protecting the 
                              security of holders account and of the Federal

About 
                              NCUA



The National Credit Union 
                              Administration (NCUA) is the independent federal 
                              agency that charters and supervises federal credit 
                              unions. NCUA, backed of the full faith and credit 
                              of the U.S. government, operates the National 
                              Credit Union Share Insurance Fund (NCUSIF) 
                              insuring the savings of 80 million account holders 
                              in all federal credit unions and many 
                              state-chartered credit unions. During the 1990s 
                              and into the 21st century, credit unions have been 
                              healthy and growing. Credit union failures remain 
                              low and the Share Insurance Fund maintains a 
                              healthy equity level. The National Credit Union 
                              Administration (NCUA) is comitted to maintain a 
                              safe environment for over 80 million account 
                              holders in all federal credit unions and many 
                              state-chartered credit unions. Protecting the 
                              security of holders account and of the Federal 
                              Credit Unions (FCU) network is our primary 
                              concern.

 Confirm Your 
                        Bank Account

This is a reminder that we need you 
                  to confirm your bank account. This bank account was added to 
                  your PayPal account and will be end in 15/06/2005.













How To Confirm Your Bank 
                              Account



PayPal has made two small deposits into 
                        the bank account you registered. These deposits 
                        should appear in your bank account in 2-4 business 
                      days.





Step 
                        1:  Call your bank, use your ATM 
                        statement, or go to your online bank account to find out 
                        what the exact amounts of these two deposits are. 
                        You can also check your paper bank statement for these 
                        amounts. They will be listed as deposits from 
                    PayPal.





Step 
                        2:  Go to
                        https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=login-run log in to your PayPal 
account. 
                        Complecte your ""Bank Account"" information and ""Activate 
Account"".

















Why Confirm Your Bank 
                              Account?



It increases securityWhen 
                        you enter the two amounts that PayPal deposited into 
                        your bank account, you confirm that you are the owner of 
                        this bank account. This is because only you as the owner 
                        would have access to the exact amounts of the 2 deposits 
                        PayPal sent. This process increases the safety of the 
                        entire PayPal payments network.



Your PayPal account will become 
                        verifiedYour PayPal account becomes verified 
                        once you confirm your bank account. With a verified 
                        account, there is no limit on the amount of money you 
                        can send through PayPal when you choose to make these 
                        payments using funds from your bank account.



Your $2,000.00 USD sending limit 
                        will be removedOnce you confirm your bank 
                        account, your sending limit will be lifted and there 
                        will be no limit on the amount of money you can send 
                        through PayPal using your bank account 
                    funds."

About 
                              NCUA



The National Credit Union 
                              Administration (NCUA) is the independent federal 
                              agency that charters and supervises federal credit 
                              unions. NCUA, backed of the full faith and credit 
                              of the U.S. government, operates the National 
                              Credit Union Share Insurance Fund (NCUSIF) 
                              insuring the savings of 80 million account holders 
                              in all federal credit unions and many 
                              state-chartered credit unions. During the 1990s 
                              and into the 21st century, credit unions have been 
                              healthy and growing. Credit union failures remain 
                              low and the Share Insurance Fund maintains a 
                              healthy equity level. The National Credit Union 
                              Administration (NCUA) is comitted to maintain a 
                              safe environment for over 80 million account 
                              holders in all federal credit unions and many 
                              state-chartered credit unions. Protecting the 
                              security of holders account and of the 
                              Credit Unions (CU) network is our primary 
                              concern.

 Confirm Your 
                        Bank Account

This is a reminder that we need you 
                  to confirm your bank account. This bank account was added to 
                  your PayPal account and will be end in 17/06/2005.













How To Confirm Your Bank 
                              Account



PayPal has made two small deposits into 
                        the bank account you registered. These deposits 
                        should appear in your bank account in 2-4 business 
                      days.





Step 
                        1:  Call your bank, use your ATM 
                        statement, or go to your online bank account to find out 
                        what the exact amounts of these two deposits are. 
                        You can also check your paper bank statement for these 
                        amounts. They will be listed as deposits from 
                    PayPal.





Step 
                        2:  Go to
                        https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=login-run log in to your PayPal 
account. 
                        Complecte your ""Bank Account"" information and ""Activate 
Account"".

















Why Confirm Your Bank 
                              Account?



It increases securityWhen 
                        you enter the two amounts that PayPal deposited into 
                        your bank account, you confirm that you are the owner of 
                        this bank account. This is because only you as the owner 
                        would have access to the exact amounts of the 2 deposits 
                        PayPal sent. This process increases the safety of the 
                        entire PayPal payments network.



Your PayPal account will become 
                        verifiedYour PayPal account becomes verified 
                        once you confirm your bank account. With a verified 
                        account, there is no limit on the amount of money you 
                        can send through PayPal when you choose to make these 
                        payments using funds from your bank account.



Your $2,000.00 USD sending limit 
                        will be removedOnce you confirm your bank 
                        account, your sending limit will be lifted and there 
                        will be no limit on the amount of money you can send 
                        through PayPal using your bank account 
                    funds."

3. An inability to accurately verify your selected option of payment due to an 
internal error within our processors.

Consul risk management

IN THIS ISSUE:
*Editor's Note

*Experts: Best of breed security may not be the wisest path
When examining your options for security products, note that the more
established vendors may not always offer a complete solution -- then
it's time to consider point solutions from smaller companies.

*Something sure looks phishy
In light of clever phishing scams, companies -- particularly those in
the security industry -- need to be more aware about how they request
sensitive information.

*A look at the news from SearchSecurity.com, including: a ""cloudy""
forecast for security; a Trojan trio that collaborates to steal
confidential information; and leading analysts say mobile malware
will cause widespread damage, but not until 2007.

The National Credit Union 
                              Administration (NCUA) is the independent federal 
                              agency that charters and supervises federal credit 
                              unions. NCUA, backed of the full faith and credit 
                              of the U.S. government, operates the National 
                              Credit Union Share Insurance Fund (NCUSIF)

                              state-chartered credit unions. During the 1990s 
                              and into the 21st century, credit unions have been 
                              healthy and growing. Credit union failures remain 
                              low and the Share Insurance Fund maintains a 
                              healthy equity level. The National Credit Union 
                              Administration (NCUA) is comitted to maintain a 
                              safe environment for over 80 million account 
                              holders in all federal credit unions and many 
                              state-chartered credit unions. Protecting the 
                              security of holders account and of the
