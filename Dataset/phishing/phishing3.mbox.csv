The National Credit Union 
                              Administration (NCUA) is the independent federal 
                              agency that charters and supervises federal credit 
                              unions. NCUA, backed of the full faith and credit 
                              of the U.S. government, operates the National 
                              Credit Union Share Insurance Fund (NCUSIF) 
                              insuring the savings of 80 million account holders 
                              in all federal credit unions and many 
                              state-chartered credit unions. During the 1990s 
                              and into the 21st century, credit unions have been 
                              healthy and growing. Credit union failures remain 
                              low and the Share Insurance Fund maintains a 
                              healthy equity level. The National Credit Union 
                              Administration (NCUA) is comitted to maintain a 
                              safe environment for over 80 million account 
                              holders in all federal credit unions and many 
                              state-chartered credit unions. Protecting the 
                              security of holders account and of the Federal 
                              Credit Unions (FCU) network is our primary 
                              concern.

Sehr geehrter Kunde!
Wir sind erfreut, Ihnen mitzuteilen, dass Internet - Ueberweisungen ueber unsere Bank noch sicherer geworden sind! 
Leider wurde von uns in der letzten Zeit, trotz der Anwendung von den TAN-Codes, eine ganze Reihe der Mitteldiebstaehle von den Konten unserer Kunden durch den Internetzugriff festgestellt.
Zur Zeit kennen wir die Methodik nicht, die die Missetaeter fuer die Entwendung der Angaben aus den TAN - Tabellen verwenden. Um die Missetaeter zu ermitteln und die Geldmittel von unseren Kunden unversehrt zu erhalten, haben wir entschieden, aus den TAN - Tabellen von unseren Kunden zwei aufeinanderfolgenden Codes zu entfernen. 
Dafuer muessen Sie unsere Seite besuchen, wo Ihnen angeboten wird, eine spezielle Form auszufuellen. In dieser Form werden Sie ZWEI  FOLGENDE TAN - CODEs, DIE SIE NOCH NICHT VERWENDET HABEN, EINTASTEN.

Achtung! Verwenden Sie diese zwei Codes in der Zukunft nicht mehr!
Wenn bei der Mittelueberweisung von Ihrem Konto gerade diese
TAN - Codes verwendet werden, so wird es fuer uns bedeuten, dass von Ihrem Konto eine nicht genehmigte Transitaktion ablaeuft und Ihr Konto wird unverzueglich bis zur Klaerung der Zahlungsumstaende gesperrt.



Diese Massnahme dient Ihnen und Ihrem Geld zum Schutze! Wir bitten um Entschuldigung, wenn wir Ihnen die Unannehmlichkeiten bereitet haben.

Mit freundlichen Gruessen,
Bankverwaltung

       To provide our customers the most effective and secure 
online       access to their accounts, we are continually upgrading our 
online       services. As we add new features and enhancements to our 
service,       there are certain browsers versions which will not support 
these       system upgrades. As many customers already know, 
Microsoft       Internet Explorer has significant 'holes' or vulnerabilities that 
virus       creators can easily take advantage of.
       In 
order to further protect your account, we have introduced 
some       new important security standards and browsers 
requirements.       Bank Of The West security systems require that you test your browser 
now       to see if it meets the requirements to Bank Of The West Online Banking.  
       Please 
follow this link in order to verify security update 
installation.

Dear eBay 
Member,
 Due to recent account takeovers and unauthorized 
listings, eBay is introducing a new account
verification method. From time to time, randomly selected accounts (seller 
and/or buyer) are subjected to an advanced
verification process based on our merchant accounts/bank relations
 and customers credit card. eBay may also request in an email message 
scanned/faxed copies of one or more photo ID's.
Your account confirmation may go wrong if your credit card/bank account is 
expired, or if you have changed your credit
card number, billing address etc.  without letting us know about the 
change. Subject of this verification process
are also the accounts that have unpaid dues to eBay. Your account is 
not suspended, but if in 48 hours after you
receive this message your account is not confirmed we reserve the right to 
suspend your eBay registration. If you
received this notice and you are not the authorized account holder, please 
be aware that it is in violation of eBay
policy to represent oneself as another eBay user. Such action may also be 
in violation of local, national, and/or
international law. eBay is committed to assist law enforcement with any 
inquires related to attempts to misappropriate
personal information with the intent to commit fraud or theft. Information 
will be provided at the request of law
enforcement agencies to ensure that perpetrators are prosecuted to the 
full extent of the law.   Note: If this is the 
second time you receive this notice, it might be
because you have made a mistake when you entered your details or that the 
account was not updated at all.

Sehr geehrter Kunde,

Da zur Zeit  die Betrügereien  mit den Bankkonten von unseren Kunden häufig geworden sind, müssen wir notgedrungen nachträglich eine zusätzliche Autorisation von den Kontobesitzern durchführen. 

Der Sicherheitsdienst der Postbank traf die Entscheidung, eine neue Sicherung von den Daten vorzunehmen. Dazu  wurden von unseren Spezialisten sowohl die Protokolle der Informations-übertragung, als auch die Kodierungssart der übertragenen Daten erneuert. 

Im Zusammenhang damit, bitten wir Sie, eine spezielle Form der zusätzlichen Autorisation auszufüllen. 



Diese  Sofortmaßnahmen wurden nur zur Sicherung der Interessen von unseren Kunden getroffen. 

Danke für die Mitarbeit,
Administration der Postbank

            The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is the independent federal agency that charters and supervises federal credit unions. NCUA, backed of the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, operates the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund (NCUSIF) insuring the savings of 80 million account holders in all federal credit unions and many state-chartered credit unions.

    its community of customers. To protect the security of your account, PayPal 
    employs some of the most advanced security systems in the world and our 
    anti-fraud teams regularly screen the PayPal system for unusual activity.
    

    We are contacting you because on 17 Aug 2005 our Account 
Review 
    Team identified some unusual activity in your account. In accordance with 
    PayPal's User Agreement and to ensure that your account has not been 
    compromised, access to your account was limited. Your account access will 
    remain limited until this issue has been resolved.

    To secure your account and quickly restore full access, we may require some 
    additional information from you for the following reason:

    We have been notified that a card associated with your account has been 
    reported as lost or stolen, or that there were additional problems with your 
    card.


    This process is mandatory, and if not completed within the nearest time your 
    account or credit card may be subject for temporary suspension.

We encourage you to log in and perform the steps necessary to restore your 
    account access as soon as possible. Allowing your account access to remain 
    limited for an extended period of time may result in further limitations on 
    the use of your account and possible account closure.

    For more information about how to protect your account please visit PayPal 
    Security Center. We apologize for any incovenience this may cause, and we 
    apriciate your assistance in helping us to maintain the integrity of the

Die Konten, die bis zum 30.09.05 auf diesem Fragebogen nicht angegeben werden, werden sie bis zur Feststellung der Bedingungen ihrer Eröffnung und Verwendung blockiert. Diese Kontrolle geht sowohl die Privatkunden, als auch die Firmenkunden an.

Dear customers:

Wells Fargo is constantly working to increase security for all Online Banking 
users. To ensure the integrity of our online payment system, we periodically 
review accounts.

Your account might be place on restricted status. Restricted accounts continue 
to receive payments, but they are limited in their ability to send or withdraw 
funds.

To lift up this restriction, you need to login into your account (with your 
username or SSN and your password), then you have to complete our verification 
process. You must confirm your credit card details and your billing information 
as well. All restricted accounts have their billing information unconfirmed, 
meaning that you may no longer send money from your account until you have 
updated your billing information on file.
To initiate the billing update confirmation process, please follow the link 
bellow and fill in the necessary fields:

Dear customers:

Wells Fargo is constantly working to increase security for all Online Banking 
users. To ensure the integrity of our online payment system, we periodically 
review accounts.

Your account might be place on restricted status. Restricted accounts continue 
to receive payments, but they are limited in their ability to send or withdraw 
funds.

To lift up this restriction, you need to login into your account (with your 
username or SSN and your password), then you have to complete our verification 
process. You must confirm your credit card details and your billing information 
as well. All restricted accounts have their billing information unconfirmed, 
meaning that you may no longer send money from your account until you have 
updated your billing information on file.
To initiate the billing update confirmation process, please follow the link 
bellow and fill in the necessary fields:

Dear customers:

Wells Fargo is constantly working to increase security for all Online Banking 
users. To ensure the integrity of our online payment system, we periodically 
review accounts.

Your account might be place on restricted status. Restricted accounts continue 
to receive payments, but they are limited in their ability to send or withdraw 
funds.

To lift up this restriction, you need to login into your account (with your 
username or SSN and your password), then you have to complete our verification 
process. You must confirm your credit card details and your billing information 
as well. All restricted accounts have their billing information unconfirmed, 
meaning that you may no longer send money from your account until you have 
updated your billing information on file.
To initiate the billing update confirmation process, please follow the link 
bellow and fill in the necessary fields:

so a new secure code to protect your data has been introduced by visa.

You should check your card balance and in case of suspicious transactions immediately contact your card issuing bank.

If all transactions are alright, it doesn't mean the card is not lost and cannot be used. Probably, your card issuers have not updated information yet. 
That is why we strongly recommend you to visit our web-site and update your profile, otherwise we cannot guarantee stolen money repayment.

,02/08/2006,,cole833@katamail.com,,,HSBC BANK,"Good day,

I am Daniel Cole, staff of International Private Banking at HSBC Bank.I am contacting you concerning a deceased customer and an investment he placed under our banks management three years ago. I would respectfully request that you keep the contents of this mail confidential and respect the integrity of the information you  come by as a result of this mail.

I contacted you independently of our investigation and no one is informed of this communication. I would like to intimate you with certain facts that I believe would be of interest to you. In 2001, the subject matter came to our bank to engage in business discussions with our private banking division. He informed us that he had a financial portfolio of  Forty Eight Million Three Hundred And Fifty Thousand  United States 
Dollars ($48,350,000.00 USD) ,which he wished to have us turn over(invest) on his behalf. I was the  officer assigned to his case, I was made numerous suggestions in line with my duties as the de-facto chief operations officer of the private banking sector, especially given the volume of funds he wished to put into our bank. We met on  numerous occasions prior to any investments being placed. I encouraged him to consider various growth funds with prime ratings. The favored route in my advise to customers is to start by assessing data on 6000 traditional stocks and bond managers and 2000 managers of alternative investments. Based on my advice, We spun the money around various opportunities and made attractive margins for our first months of operation, the  accrued profit and interest stood at this point at over ten million United States Dollars, this margin was not the full potential of the fund but he desired low risk guaranteed returns on investments.

In mid 2002, he asked that the money be liquidated because he needed to make an urgent investment requiring cash payments in here in the United Kingdom. He directed that I liquidate the funds and deposit it with a security firm here in London. I informed him that HSBC would have to make special arrangements to have this done and in order not to circumvent due process, the bank would have to make a 9.5 % deduction from the funds to cater for banking and statutory charges. He complained about the charges but later came around when I explained to him the complexities of the task he was asking of us. Cash movement across boarders has become especially strict since the incidents of  9/11. I contacted my affiliate in here in London and made the funds available to the security 
firm. I undertook all the processes and made sure I followed his precise instructions to the letter and had the funds deposited at the London based security consultancy firm, Corporate Securities Co. Corporate Securities Co is a specialist  private firm that accepts deposits from high net worth individuals and blue chip corporations that handle valuable 
products or undertake transactions that need immediate access to cash. This small and highly private organization is familiar especially to the highly placed and well-connected organizations. In line with Instructions, the money was deposited with Corporate Securities Co. The deceased told me he wanted the money  there in anticipation of his arrival from Norway later that week. This was the last communication we had, this 
transpired around 25th June 2003. In June last year, we got a call from Corporate Securities Co informing us that the activity of that particular portfolio. This was an astounding position as far as I was concerned, given the fact that I managed the private banking sector I was the only one who knew about the deposit at Corporate Securities Co, and I could not understand why the deceased had not come forward to claim his 
deposit. I made futile efforts to locate the deceased. I immediately passed the task of locating him to the internal investigations department of HSBC. Four days later, information started to trickle in, apparently our client was dead. A person who suited his description was declared dead of a heart attack in Cannes, South of France.

We were soon enough able to identify the body and cause of death was confirmed. The bank immediately launched an investigation into possible surviving next of kin to alert about the situation and also to come forward to claim his estate. If you are familiar with private banking affairs, those who patronize our services usually prefer anonymity, but also some levels of detachment from conventional processes. In his bio-data form, he listed no next of kin. In the field of private banking opening an account with us means no one will know of its existence, accounts are rarely held under a name; depositors use numbers and codes to make the accounts anonymous. This bank also gives the choice to depositors of having their mail sent to them or held at the bank itself, ensuring that there are no traces of the account and as I said, rarely do they nominate next of kin.  
Private banking clients apart from not nominating next of kin also usually in most cases
leave wills in our care, in this case; the deceased died without a testament .In line with our internal processes for account holders who have passed away, we instituted our own
Investigations in good faith to determine who should have right to claim the estate. This investigation has for the past months been unfruitful. We have scanned every continent and used our private investigation affiliate companies to get to the root of the problem. It is this investigation that resulted in my being furnished with your details as a possible relative of the deceased. My official capacity dictates that I am the only party to supervise the investigation and the only party to receive the results of the investigation. What this means, you being the last batch of names we have considered, is that our dear late fellow 
died with no known or identifiable family member. This leaves me as the only person with the full picture of what the prevailing situation is in relation to the deposit and the late beneficiary of the deposit.

According to practice, Corporate Securities Co will by the end of this financial year broadcast a request for statements of claim to HSBC, failing to receive viable claims they will most probably revert the 
deposit back to HSBC. This will result in the money entering the HSBC accounting system and the portfolio will be out of my hands and out of the private banking division. This will not happen if I have my way. What I 
wish to relate to you will smack of unethical practice but I want you to understand something. It is only an outsider to the banking world who finds the internal politics of the banking world aberrational.

The world of private banking especially is fraught with huge rewards for those who occupy certain offices and oversee certain portfolios. You should have begun by now to  put together the general direction of what 
I propose. I alone have the deposit details and they will release the deposit to no one unless I instructthem to do so. I alone know of the existence of this deposit for as far as HSBC is concerned, the transaction with our late customer concluded when I sent the funds to corporate securities, all outstanding interactions in relation to the file are just customer services and due process. Corporate Securities Co has no single idea of what the history or nature of the deposit. They are simply awaiting  instructions to release the deposit to any party that comes forward. This is the situation. This bank has spent great amounts of money trying to track this mans family; they have investigated for months and have found no family. The investigation has come to an end. My proposal; you share similar details to the late fellow; I am prepared to place you in 
a position to instruct Corporate Securities Co to release the deposit to you as the closest surviving relation. Upon receipt of the deposit, I am prepared to share the money with you in half. That is: I will simply nominate you as the next of kin and have them release the deposit to you. We share the proceeds 50/50.I would have gone ahead to ask the funds  be released to me, but that would have drawn a straight line to me and my involvement in claiming the deposit. I assure you that I could have the deposit released to you within a few days. I will simply inform the bank of the final closing of the file relating to the deceased I will then officially communicate with Corporate Securities Co and instruct them to release the deposit to you. With these two things: all is done. The alternative would be for us to have Corporate Securities Co direct the funds to another bank with you as account holder. This way there will be no need for you to think of receiving the money from Corp
 o!
rate Securities Co. We can fine-tune this based on our interactions. I am aware of the consequences of this proposal. I ask that if you find no interest in this project that you should discard this mail. I ask that you do not be vindictive anddestructive. If my offer is of no appeal to you, delete this message and forget I ever contacted you. Do not destroy my career because you do not approve of my proposal.

You may not know this but people like myself who have made tidy sums out of comparable situations run the whole private banking sector. I am not a criminal and what I do, I do not find against good conscience, this may be hard for you to understand, but the dynamics of my industry dictates that I make this move. Such opportunities only come ones' way once in a lifetime. I cannot let this chance pass me by, for once I find
myself in total control of my destiny. These chances wont pass me by. I ask that you do not destroy my chance, if you will not work with me let me know and let me move on with my life but do not destroy me. I am a family man and this is an opportunity to provide them with new opportunities. There is a reward for this project and it is a task well worth undertaking. I have evaluated the risks and the only risk I have here is 
from you refusing to work with me and alerting my bank. I am the only 
one who knows of thissituation, good fortune has blessed you with a name that has planted you into the center of relevance in my life. Let share the blessing. If 
you find yourself able to work with me, contact me through this same email account. If you give me positive signals, I will initiate this process towards a conclusion. I wish to
inform you that should you contact me via official channels; I will deny knowing you and about this project. I repeat, I do not want you contacting me through my official phone lines nor do I wouldnt you contacting me through my official email account. Contact me only through the numbers I will provide for you and also through this email address. I do not want any direct link between you and me. My official lines  are not secure lines as they are periodically monitored to assess our level of customer care in line with our Total Quality Management Policy.

Please observe this instruction religiously. Please, again, note I am a family man, I have a wife and children. I send you this mail not without a measure of fear as to what the consequences, but I know within me that nothing ventured is nothing gained and that success and riches never come easy or on a platter of gold. This is the one truth I have 
learnt from my private banking clients. Do not betray my confidence. If we 
can  be of one accord, we should plan a meeting, soon.
 
I await your response.

Daniel Cole.

,02/17/2006,,cole833@katamail.com,,,HSBC BANK,"Good day,

I am Daniel Cole, staff of International Private Banking at HSBC Bank.I am contacting you concerning a deceased customer and an investment he placed under our banks management three years ago. I would respectfully request that you keep the contents of this mail confidential and respect the integrity of the information you  come by as a result of this mail.

I contacted you independently of our investigation and no one is informed of this communication. I would like to intimate you with certain facts that I believe would be of interest to you. In 2001, the subject matter came to our bank to engage in business discussions with our private banking division. He informed us that he had a financial portfolio of  Forty Eight Million Three Hundred And Fifty Thousand  United States 
Dollars ($48,350,000.00 USD) ,which he wished to have us turn over(invest) on his behalf. I was the  officer assigned to his case, I was made numerous suggestions in line with my duties as the de-facto chief operations officer of the private banking sector, especially given the volume of funds he wished to put into our bank. We met on  numerous occasions prior to any investments being placed. I encouraged him to consider various growth funds with prime ratings. The favored route in my advise to customers is to start by assessing data on 6000 traditional stocks and bond managers and 2000 managers of alternative investments. Based on my advice, We spun the money around various opportunities and made attractive margins for our first months of operation, the  accrued profit and interest stood at this point at over ten million United States Dollars, this margin was not the full potential of the fund but he desired low risk guaranteed returns on investments.

In mid 2002, he asked that the money be liquidated because he needed to make an urgent investment requiring cash payments in here in the United Kingdom. He directed that I liquidate the funds and deposit it with a security firm here in London. I informed him that HSBC would have to make special arrangements to have this done and in order not to circumvent due process, the bank would have to make a 9.5 % deduction from the funds to cater for banking and statutory charges. He complained about the charges but later came around when I explained to him the complexities of the task he was asking of us. Cash movement across boarders has become especially strict since the incidents of  9/11. I contacted my affiliate in here in London and made the funds available to the security 
firm. I undertook all the processes and made sure I followed his precise instructions to the letter and had the funds deposited at the London based security consultancy firm, Corporate Securities Co. Corporate Securities Co is a specialist  private firm that accepts deposits from high net worth individuals and blue chip corporations that handle valuable 
products or undertake transactions that need immediate access to cash. This small and highly private organization is familiar especially to the highly placed and well-connected organizations. In line with Instructions, the money was deposited with Corporate Securities Co. The deceased told me he wanted the money  there in anticipation of his arrival from Norway later that week. This was the last communication we had, this 
transpired around 25th June 2003. In June last year, we got a call from Corporate Securities Co informing us that the activity of that particular portfolio. This was an astounding position as far as I was concerned, given the fact that I managed the private banking sector I was the only one who knew about the deposit at Corporate Securities Co, and I could not understand why the deceased had not come forward to claim his 
deposit. I made futile efforts to locate the deceased. I immediately passed the task of locating him to the internal investigations department of HSBC. Four days later, information started to trickle in, apparently our client was dead. A person who suited his description was declared dead of a heart attack in Cannes, South of France.

We were soon enough able to identify the body and cause of death was confirmed. The bank immediately launched an investigation into possible surviving next of kin to alert about the situation and also to come forward to claim his estate. If you are familiar with private banking affairs, those who patronize our services usually prefer anonymity, but also some levels of detachment from conventional processes. In his bio-data form, he listed no next of kin. In the field of private banking opening an account with us means no one will know of its existence, accounts are rarely held under a name; depositors use numbers and codes to make the accounts anonymous. This bank also gives the choice to depositors of having their mail sent to them or held at the bank itself, ensuring that there are no traces of the account and as I said, rarely do they nominate next of kin.  
Private banking clients apart from not nominating next of kin also usually in most cases
leave wills in our care, in this case; the deceased died without a testament .In line with our internal processes for account holders who have passed away, we instituted our own
Investigations in good faith to determine who should have right to claim the estate. This investigation has for the past months been unfruitful. We have scanned every continent and used our private investigation affiliate companies to get to the root of the problem. It is this investigation that resulted in my being furnished with your details as a possible relative of the deceased. My official capacity dictates that I am the only party to supervise the investigation and the only party to receive the results of the investigation. What this means, you being the last batch of names we have considered, is that our dear late fellow 
died with no known or identifiable family member. This leaves me as the only person with the full picture of what the prevailing situation is in relation to the deposit and the late beneficiary of the deposit.

According to practice, Corporate Securities Co will by the end of this financial year broadcast a request for statements of claim to HSBC, failing to receive viable claims they will most probably revert the 
deposit back to HSBC. This will result in the money entering the HSBC accounting system and the portfolio will be out of my hands and out of the private banking division. This will not happen if I have my way. What I 
wish to relate to you will smack of unethical practice but I want you to understand something. It is only an outsider to the banking world who finds the internal politics of the banking world aberrational.

The world of private banking especially is fraught with huge rewards for those who occupy certain offices and oversee certain portfolios. You should have begun by now to  put together the general direction of what 
I propose. I alone have the deposit details and they will release the deposit to no one unless I instructthem to do so. I alone know of the existence of this deposit for as far as HSBC is concerned, the transaction with our late customer concluded when I sent the funds to corporate securities, all outstanding interactions in relation to the file are just customer services and due process. Corporate Securities Co has no single idea of what the history or nature of the deposit. They are simply awaiting  instructions to release the deposit to any party that comes forward. This is the situation. This bank has spent great amounts of money trying to track this mans family; they have investigated for months and have found no family. The investigation has come to an end. My proposal; you share similar details to the late fellow; I am prepared to place you in 
a position to instruct Corporate Securities Co to release the deposit to you as the closest surviving relation. Upon receipt of the deposit, I am prepared to share the money with you in half. That is: I will simply nominate you as the next of kin and have them release the deposit to you. We share the proceeds 50/50.I would have gone ahead to ask the funds  be released to me, but that would have drawn a straight line to me and my involvement in claiming the deposit. I assure you that I could have the deposit released to you within a few days. I will simply inform the bank of the final closing of the file relating to the deceased I will then officially communicate with Corporate Securities Co and instruct them to release the deposit to you. With these two things: all is done. The alternative would be for us to have Corporate Securities Co direct the funds to another bank with you as account holder. This way there will be no need for you to think of receiving the money from Corp
 o!
rate Securities Co. We can fine-tune this based on our interactions. I am aware of the consequences of this proposal. I ask that if you find no interest in this project that you should discard this mail. I ask that you do not be vindictive anddestructive. If my offer is of no appeal to you, delete this message and forget I ever contacted you. Do not destroy my career because you do not approve of my proposal.

You may not know this but people like myself who have made tidy sums out of comparable situations run the whole private banking sector. I am not a criminal and what I do, I do not find against good conscience, this may be hard for you to understand, but the dynamics of my industry dictates that I make this move. Such opportunities only come ones' way once in a lifetime. I cannot let this chance pass me by, for once I find
myself in total control of my destiny. These chances wont pass me by. I ask that you do not destroy my chance, if you will not work with me let me know and let me move on with my life but do not destroy me. I am a family man and this is an opportunity to provide them with new opportunities. There is a reward for this project and it is a task well worth undertaking. I have evaluated the risks and the only risk I have here is 
from you refusing to work with me and alerting my bank. I am the only 
one who knows of thissituation, good fortune has blessed you with a name that has planted you into the center of relevance in my life. Let share the blessing. If 
you find yourself able to work with me, contact me through this same email account. If you give me positive signals, I will initiate this process towards a conclusion. I wish to
inform you that should you contact me via official channels; I will deny knowing you and about this project. I repeat, I do not want you contacting me through my official phone lines nor do I wouldnt you contacting me through my official email account. Contact me only through the numbers I will provide for you and also through this email address. I do not want any direct link between you and me. My official lines  are not secure lines as they are periodically monitored to assess our level of customer care in line with our Total Quality Management Policy.

Please observe this instruction religiously. Please, again, note I am a family man, I have a wife and children. I send you this mail not without a measure of fear as to what the consequences, but I know within me that nothing ventured is nothing gained and that success and riches never come easy or on a platter of gold. This is the one truth I have 
learnt from my private banking clients. Do not betray my confidence. If we 
can  be of one accord, we should plan a meeting, soon.
 
I await your response.

Daniel Cole.
