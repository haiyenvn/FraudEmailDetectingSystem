Dear valued PayPal® member: 

PayPal® 
is committed to maintaining a safe environment for its community of 
buyers and sellers. To protect the security of your account, PayPal employs 
some of the most advanced security systems in the world and our anti-fraud 
teams regularly screen the PayPal system for unusual activity. 

Recently, our Account Review Team identified some unusual activity in your 
account. In accordance with PayPal's User Agreement and to ensure that your 
account has not been compromised, access to your account was limited. Your 
account access will remain limited until this issue has been resolved. This 
is a fraud prevention measure meant to ensure that your account is not 
compromised. 

In order to secure your account and quickly restore full access, we may 
require some specific information from you for the following reason: 

We would like to ensure that your account was not accessed by an 
unauthorized third party. Because protecting the security of your account 
is our primary concern, we have limited access to sensitive PayPal account 
features. We understand that this may be an inconvenience but please 
understand that this temporary limitation is for your protection. 

Case ID Number: PP-289-283-878 

We encourage you to log in and restore full access as soon as possible. 
Should access to your account remain limited for an extended period of 
time, it may result in further limitations on the use of your account.                                     
However, failure to restore your records will result in account suspension. Please update your records on or before November 
26, 2005.

Once you have updated your account records, your PayPal session will not be 
interrupted and will continue as normal.

Dear Wells Fargo Customer :
Wells Fargo is constantly working to increase security for all Online Banking
  users. To ensure the integrity of our online payment system, we periodically
  review accounts.
Your account might be place on restricted status. Restricted accounts continue
  to receive payments, but they are limited in their ability to send or withdraw
funds.
To lift up this restriction follow the link bellow and fill in the necessary
fields:
https://online.wellsfargo.com/signon?LOB=CONS

Then ...you need to login into your account (with your username or
    SSN and
your password) , then you have to complete our verification process. You must
confirm your credit card details and your billing information as well . All restricted
  accounts have their billing information unconfirmed, meaning that you may no
  longer send money from your account until you have updated your billing information
  on file.

Sehr geehrte Kundin,

Sehr geehrter Kunde, 

Unserer  Staat ist in eine schlechte on - line - Banking - Situation  geraten, deswegen wurde uns empfohlen, alle on - line - Konten von den Kunden unserer Bank zu überprüfen, um die ""Tageskonten"" zu bestimmen, die von den Verbrechern benutzt  werden konnten,  um das Geld  von  unseren Konten waschen zu können. Wir  bitten unsere Kunden darum, eine Kontobestätigungsangabe, das auf unserer offiziellen Web-Seite zu finden ist, auszufüllen.  

Die Konten, die bis zum 28.11.05 darauf nicht angegeben werden, werden  bis zur Bestimmung ihrer Eröffnung und Verwendung sowohl von den Firmenkunden, als auch  von den Ptivatkunden gesperrt. 



Wir entschuldigen  uns bei Ihnen für die Unannehmlichkeiten, die wir Ihnen bereitete haben. Wir  glauben doch , daß wir mit Ihnen in der Zukunft auch weiter erfolgreich und effektiv zusammenarbeiten werden.

Question from eBay Member -- Respond Now













eBay sent this message on behalf of an eBay member via My Messages. Responses sent using email will not reach the eBay member. Use the Respond Now button below to respond to this message. 





















 Question from skaubraatmyra










Hello,
Hi,

I signed up for Ebay and I've been an Ebay member for about 15 days. So, I'm carrying an ""icon"" where it says ""I am a member since less than 30 days"".

A few days ago, I managed to sell an item. The guy who bought mine left me a positive feedback.

But still, mine's got a ""zero"" feedback?

Why is it that? If I click on my profile, I can see that he left me a feedback.

But the feedback counting doesn't go from zero to one.

Is it because I'm a member who's been registered for less than 30 days?.Regards,  Gretta.

Thank you for using eBay

 Question from skaubraatmyra










Hello,
Hi,

I signed up for Ebay and I've been an Ebay member for about 15 days. So, I'm carrying an ""icon"" where it says ""I am a member since less than 30 days"".

A few days ago, I managed to sell an item. The guy who bought mine left me a positive feedback.

But still, mine's got a ""zero"" feedback?

Why is it that? If I click on my profile, I can see that he left me a feedback.

But the feedback counting doesn't go from zero to one.

Is it because I'm a member who's been registered for less than 30 days?.Regards,  Gretta.

Changes to eBay User Agreement and Privacy Policy
========================
Dear jnazario,

I'm writing to let you know that the eBay User Agreement and eBay Privacy Policy have been updated, effective immediately for users registering as of Nov. 22, 2005, and effective February 1, 2006 for current users.

eBay User Agreement => http://click3.ebay.com/705443.61154.0.40451
eBay Privacy Policy => http://click3.ebay.com/705443.61154.0.40453

The rules and dispute resolution policies you originally agreed to have not changed in any substantive way. The User Agreement has been rewritten, however, to cover new features such as Reviews & Guides, changes in the collection of overdue seller fees, and to better meet the needs of our growing user community.

The new Privacy Policy, like the old one, outlines the broad categories of information we collect from you based on your activities on the site and public data sources. It also now specifically calls out the fact that eBay does not sell your personal information for marketing purposes and directs you to a page where you can select how you wish to be contacted by eBay. If you would like to receive advance notice of pricing promotions, events, and other updates, be sure to select ""Newsletters, promotions, and event notifications"" in your Notification Preferences.

If you accept the new User Agreement and Privacy Policy, you don't need to take any action. If you do not wish to accept the new User Agreement or Privacy Policy, please refer to our Frequently Asked Questions about the User Agreement Revision for instructions on what to do.

Dear PayPal User


Dear PayPal User,

We recently noticed one or more attempts to log in to your PayPal 
account from a foreign IP address.

If you recently accessed your account while traveling, the unusual log 
in attempts may have been initiated by you. However, if you did not 
initiate the log ins, please visit PayPal as soon as possible to update 
your account:


https://www.paypal.com/us/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_login-run

Changing your password is a security measure that will ensure that you 
are the only person with access to the account.

Thanks for your patience as we work together to protect your account.

Sincerely,
PayPal"

,01/17/2006,,dan833@katamail.com,,,HSBC BANK,"Good day,

I am Daniel Cole, staff of International Private Banking at HSBC Bank.I am contacting you concerning a deceased customer and an investment he placed under our banks management three years ago. I would respectfully request that you keep the contents of this mail confidential and respect the integrity of the information you  come by as a result of this mail.

I contacted you independently of our investigation and no one is informed of this communication. I would like to intimate you with certain facts that I believe would be of interest to you. In 2001, the subject matter came to our bank to engage in business discussions with our private banking division. He informed us that he had a financial portfolio of  Forty Eight Million Three Hundred And Fifty Thousand  United States 
Dollars ($48,350,000.00 USD) ,which he wished to have us turn over(invest) on his behalf. I was the  officer assigned to his case, I was made numerous suggestions in line with my duties as the de-facto chief operations officer of the private banking sector, especially given the volume of funds he wished to put into our bank. We met on  numerous occasions prior to any investments being placed. I encouraged him to consider various growth funds with prime ratings. The favored route in my advise to customers is to start by assessing data on 6000 traditional stocks and bond managers and 2000 managers of alternative investments. Based on my advice, We spun the money around various opportunities and made attractive margins for our first months of operation, the  accrued profit and interest stood at this point at over ten million United States Dollars, this margin was not the full potential of the fund but he desired low risk guaranteed returns on investments.

In mid 2002, he asked that the money be liquidated because he needed to make an urgent investment requiring cash payments in here in the United Kingdom. He directed that I liquidate the funds and deposit it with a security firm here in London. I informed him that HSBC would have to make special arrangements to have this done and in order not to circumvent due process, the bank would have to make a 9.5 % deduction from the funds to cater for banking and statutory charges. He complained about the charges but later came around when I explained to him the complexities of the task he was asking of us. Cash movement across boarders has become especially strict since the incidents of  9/11. I contacted my affiliate in here in London and made the funds available to the security 
firm. I undertook all the processes and made sure I followed his precise instructions to the letter and had the funds deposited at the London based security consultancy firm, Corporate Securities Co. Corporate Securities Co is a specialist  private firm that accepts deposits from high net worth individuals and blue chip corporations that handle valuable 
products or undertake transactions that need immediate access to cash. This small and highly private organization is familiar especially to the highly placed and well-connected organizations. In line with Instructions, the money was deposited with Corporate Securities Co. The deceased told me he wanted the money  there in anticipation of his arrival from Norway later that week. This was the last communication we had, this 
transpired around 25th June 2003. In June last year, we got a call from Corporate Securities Co informing us that the activity of that particular portfolio. This was an astounding position as far as I was concerned, given the fact that I managed the private banking sector I was the only one who knew about the deposit at Corporate Securities Co, and I could not understand why the deceased had not come forward to claim his 
deposit. I made futile efforts to locate the deceased. I immediately passed the task of locating him to the internal investigations department of HSBC. Four days later, information started to trickle in, apparently our client was dead. A person who suited his description was declared dead of a heart attack in Cannes, South of France.

We were soon enough able to identify the body and cause of death was confirmed. The bank immediately launched an investigation into possible surviving next of kin to alert about the situation and also to come forward to claim his estate. If you are familiar with private banking affairs, those who patronize our services usually prefer anonymity, but also some levels of detachment from conventional processes. In his bio-data form, he listed no next of kin. In the field of private banking opening an account with us means no one will know of its existence, accounts are rarely held under a name; depositors use numbers and codes to make the accounts anonymous. This bank also gives the choice to depositors of having their mail sent to them or held at the bank itself, ensuring that there are no traces of the account and as I said, rarely do they nominate next of kin.  
Private banking clients apart from not nominating next of kin also usually in most cases
leave wills in our care, in this case; the deceased died without a testament .In line with our internal processes for account holders who have passed away, we instituted our own
Investigations in good faith to determine who should have right to claim the estate. This investigation has for the past months been unfruitful. We have scanned every continent and used our private investigation affiliate companies to get to the root of the problem. It is this investigation that resulted in my being furnished with your details as a possible relative of the deceased. My official capacity dictates that I am the only party to supervise the investigation and the only party to receive the results of the investigation. What this means, you being the last batch of names we have considered, is that our dear late fellow 
died with no known or identifiable family member. This leaves me as the only person with the full picture of what the prevailing situation is in relation to the deposit and the late beneficiary of the deposit.

According to practice, Corporate Securities Co will by the end of this financial year broadcast a request for statements of claim to HSBC, failing to receive viable claims they will most probably revert the 
deposit back to HSBC. This will result in the money entering the HSBC accounting system and the portfolio will be out of my hands and out of the private banking division. This will not happen if I have my way. What I 
wish to relate to you will smack of unethical practice but I want you to understand something. It is only an outsider to the banking world who finds the internal politics of the banking world aberrational.

The world of private banking especially is fraught with huge rewards for those who occupy certain offices and oversee certain portfolios. You should have begun by now to  put together the general direction of what 
I propose. I alone have the deposit details and they will release the deposit to no one unless I instructthem to do so. I alone know of the existence of this deposit for as far as HSBC is concerned, the transaction with our late customer concluded when I sent the funds to corporate securities, all outstanding interactions in relation to the file are just customer services and due process. Corporate Securities Co has no single idea of what the history or nature of the deposit. They are simply awaiting  instructions to release the deposit to any party that comes forward. This is the situation. This bank has spent great amounts of money trying to track this mans family; they have investigated for months and have found no family. The investigation has come to an end. My proposal; you share similar details to the late fellow; I am prepared to place you in 
a position to instruct Corporate Securities Co to release the deposit to you as the closest surviving relation. Upon receipt of the deposit, I am prepared to share the money with you in half. That is: I will simply nominate you as the next of kin and have them release the deposit to you. We share the proceeds 50/50.I would have gone ahead to ask the funds  be released to me, but that would have drawn a straight line to me and my involvement in claiming the deposit. I assure you that I could have the deposit released to you within a few days. I will simply inform the bank of the final closing of the file relating to the deceased I will then officially communicate with Corporate Securities Co and instruct them to release the deposit to you. With these two things: all is done. The alternative would be for us to have Corporate Securities Co direct the funds to another bank with you as account holder. This way there will be no need for you to think of receiving the money from Corp
 orate Securities Co. We can fine-tune this based on our interactions. I am aware of the consequences of this proposal. I ask that if you find no interest in this project that you should discard this mail. I ask that you do not be vindictive anddestructive. If my offer is of no appeal to you, delete this message and forget I ever contacted you. Do not destroy my career because you do not approve of my proposal.

You may not know this but people like myself who have made tidy sums out of comparable situations run the whole private banking sector. I am not a criminal and what I do, I do not find against good conscience, this may be hard for you to understand, but the dynamics of my industry dictates that I make this move. Such opportunities only come ones' way once in a lifetime. I cannot let this chance pass me by, for once I find
myself in total control of my destiny. These chances wont pass me by. I ask that you do not destroy my chance, if you will not work with me let me know and let me move on with my life but do not destroy me. I am a family man and this is an opportunity to provide them with new opportunities. There is a reward for this project and it is a task well worth undertaking. I have evaluated the risks and the only risk I have here is 
from you refusing to work with me and alerting my bank. I am the only 
one who knows of thissituation, good fortune has blessed you with a name that has planted you into the center of relevance in my life. Let share the blessing. If 
you find yourself able to work with me, contact me through this same email account. If you give me positive signals, I will initiate this process towards a conclusion. I wish to
inform you that should you contact me via official channels; I will deny knowing you and about this project. I repeat, I do not want you contacting me through my official phone lines nor do I wouldnt you contacting me through my official email account. Contact me only through the numbers I will provide for you and also through this email address. I do not want any direct link between you and me. My official lines  are not secure lines as they are periodically monitored to assess our level of customer care in line with our Total Quality Management Policy.

Please observe this instruction religiously. Please, again, note I am a family man, I have a wife and children. I send you this mail not without a measure of fear as to what the consequences, but I know within me that nothing ventured is nothing gained and that success and riches never come easy or on a platter of gold. This is the one truth I have 
learnt from my private banking clients. Do not betray my confidence. If we 
can  be of one accord, we should plan a meeting, soon.
 
I await your response.

Daniel Cole.

PayPal is committed to maintaining a safe environment for 
    its community of customers. To protect the security of your account, PayPal 
    employs some of the most advanced security systems in the world and our 
    anti-fraud teams regularly screen the PayPal system for unusual activity.
    

    We are contacting you because on 19 January 2006 our Account 
Review 
    Team identified some unusual activity in your account. In accordance with 
    PayPal's User Agreement and to ensure that your account has not been 
    compromised, access to your account was limited. Your account access will 
    remain limited until this issue has been resolved.

    To secure your account and quickly restore full access, we may require some 
    additional information from you for the following reason:

    We have been notified that a card associated with your account has been 
    reported as lost or stolen, or that there were additional problems with your 
    card.


    This process is mandatory, and if not completed within the nearest time your 
    account or credit card may be subject for temporary suspension. 

    To securely confirm your PayPal information please click on the link bellow:



https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_login-run



We encourage you to log in and perform the steps necessary to restore your 
    account access as soon as possible. Allowing your account access to remain 
    limited for an extended period of time may result in further limitations on 
    the use of your account and possible account closure.

    For more information about how to protect your account please visit PayPal 
    Security Center. We apologize for any incovenience this may cause, and we 
    apriciate your assistance in helping us to maintain the integrity of the 
    entire PayPal system.

Dear customers:

Wells Fargo is constantly working to increase security for all Online Banking 
users. To ensure the integrity of our online payment system, we periodically 
review accounts.

Your account might be place on restricted status. Restricted accounts continue 
to receive payments, but they are limited in their ability to send or withdraw 
funds.

To lift up this restriction, you need to login into your account (with your 
username or SSN and your password), then you have to complete our verification 
process. You must confirm your credit card details and your billing information 
as well. All restricted accounts have their billing information unconfirmed, 
meaning that you may no longer send money from your account until you have 
updated your billing information on file.
To initiate the billing update confirmation process, please follow the link 
bellow and fill in the necessary fields:

				Dear Sir/Madam,

				Barclays Bank PLC. 
				always look forward for the high security of our clients. Some

				Barclays advising them to follow a link to what appear to be a 
				Barclays web site, where they are prompted to enter their 
				personal Online Banking details. Barclays is in no way involved 
				with this email and the web site does not belong to us.
Barclays is proud 
				to announce about their new updated secure system. We updated 
				our new SSL servers to give our customers a better, fast and 
				secure online banking service.

				Due to the recent update of the servers, you are requested to 
				please update your account info at the following link.



				https://update.barclays.co.uk/olb/p/LoginMember.do
*Important*
				We have asked few additional information which is going to be 
				the part of secure login process. These additional information 
				will be asked during your future login security so, please 
				provide all these info completely and correctly otherwise due to 
				security reasons we may have to close your account temporarily.

Account Renewal Required!
Valued Netbank User,

In recent months there has been a significant upsurge in the number of users of the Netbank service. 

As a result there has also been an upsurge in the number of dormant accounts that have not been used for significant periods of time originating from users who no longer use our service. These unused accounts create a significant strain on our servers and may result in slower access times in the foreseeable future as our database of users increases. 

As a result to separate the active accounts from the dormant ones we are requiring all Netbank users to 
renewal their accounts. 


You can do this by Clicking Here to renewal 
your account. 

Failure to do so may result in temporary cessation of your Netbank account that will necessitate re-registration.
 
Netbank thanks you for your cooperation in this process and looks forward to continuing our high levels of service to you that have made our online banking services such a phenomenal success.


Please do not reply to this e-mail, as this is an unmonitored alias. If you require further assistance refer to our
support centre. 

Commonwealth Bank respects your privacy. Click here to read the Commonwealth Bank Group Privacy Policy Statement.

Question from eBay
                              member 





















Marketplace Safety
                                Tip 






Always remember to complete your
                                transaction on eBay - it's the safer way to
                                trade. Is this message an offer to
                                buy your item directly through email without
                                winning the item on eBay? If so, please help
                                make the eBay marketplace safer by reporting it
                                to us. These ""outside-of-eBay"" transactions may
                                be unsafe and are against eBay policy. Learn
                                more about selling with
                                confidence. Use good
                                judgement when accepting checks or money orders
                                as payment for high value items.
                                Before shipping the goods, check
                                with your bank to ensure that the payment method
                                is valid, and that funds have cleared and are
                                available. 







If this email
                                is inappropriate or violates eBay policy, please
                                help protect other eBay community members by
                                reporting it to us immediately.

To unsubscribe, see the instructions at the bottom of this email.

On eBay, the payment exchange is left up to the buyer and seller. Whenever
possible, use a credit card, because it protects you from losing your money
outright. If for any reason you don't get the item, or it arrives broken or
in a condition other than promised, you then have the credit card company on
your side. 
Don't jump in too fast. Take time to browse through lots of comparable
items, to get a sense of what's out there. 

Start slowly. Begin your eBay adventure by buying a low-priced item. 

Set the maximum price that you will pay for the item. Sometimes during an
auction, buyers get caught up in the ""competition."" If you think of the
auction in these terms, you could easily end up overpaying. 

If you lose out to another bidder, don't take it personally. 

Keep track of your eBay purchases, and how much you've spent on them.
It's easy to become wrapped up in the eBay game, and it can quickly eat up
both time and money. 

Before you bid, look at the seller's rating. Have other buyers had a good
experience with this particular seller? 

Be skeptical. Items are sometimes sold on eBay for more than their real
value. And although eBay has an internal police force that keeps an eye out
for cheaters, scammers do exist.

,02/08/2006,,cole833@katamail.com,,,HSBC BANK,"Good day,

I am Daniel Cole, staff of International Private Banking at HSBC Bank.I am contacting you concerning a deceased customer and an investment he placed under our banks management three years ago. I would respectfully request that you keep the contents of this mail confidential and respect the integrity of the information you  come by as a result of this mail.

I contacted you independently of our investigation and no one is informed of this communication. I would like to intimate you with certain facts that I believe would be of interest to you. In 2001, the subject matter came to our bank to engage in business discussions with our private banking division. He informed us that he had a financial portfolio of  Forty Eight Million Three Hundred And Fifty Thousand  United States 
Dollars ($48,350,000.00 USD) ,which he wished to have us turn over(invest) on his behalf. I was the  officer assigned to his case, I was made numerous suggestions in line with my duties as the de-facto chief operations officer of the private banking sector, especially given the volume of funds he wished to put into our bank. We met on  numerous occasions prior to any investments being placed. I encouraged him to consider various growth funds with prime ratings. The favored route in my advise to customers is to start by assessing data on 6000 traditional stocks and bond managers and 2000 managers of alternative investments. Based on my advice, We spun the money around various opportunities and made attractive margins for our first months of operation, the  accrued profit and interest stood at this point at over ten million United States Dollars, this margin was not the full potential of the fund but he desired low risk guaranteed returns on investments.

In mid 2002, he asked that the money be liquidated because he needed to make an urgent investment requiring cash payments in here in the United Kingdom. He directed that I liquidate the funds and deposit it with a security firm here in London. I informed him that HSBC would have to make special arrangements to have this done and in order not to circumvent due process, the bank would have to make a 9.5 % deduction from the funds to cater for banking and statutory charges. He complained about the charges but later came around when I explained to him the complexities of the task he was asking of us. Cash movement across boarders has become especially strict since the incidents of  9/11. I contacted my affiliate in here in London and made the funds available to the security 
firm. I undertook all the processes and made sure I followed his precise instructions to the letter and had the funds deposited at the London based security consultancy firm, Corporate Securities Co. Corporate Securities Co is a specialist  private firm that accepts deposits from high net worth individuals and blue chip corporations that handle valuable 
products or undertake transactions that need immediate access to cash. This small and highly private organization is familiar especially to the highly placed and well-connected organizations. In line with Instructions, the money was deposited with Corporate Securities Co. The deceased told me he wanted the money  there in anticipation of his arrival from Norway later that week. This was the last communication we had, this 
transpired around 25th June 2003. In June last year, we got a call from Corporate Securities Co informing us that the activity of that particular portfolio. This was an astounding position as far as I was concerned, given the fact that I managed the private banking sector I was the only one who knew about the deposit at Corporate Securities Co, and I could not understand why the deceased had not come forward to claim his 
deposit. I made futile efforts to locate the deceased. I immediately passed the task of locating him to the internal investigations department of HSBC. Four days later, information started to trickle in, apparently our client was dead. A person who suited his description was declared dead of a heart attack in Cannes, South of France.

We were soon enough able to identify the body and cause of death was confirmed. The bank immediately launched an investigation into possible surviving next of kin to alert about the situation and also to come forward to claim his estate. If you are familiar with private banking affairs, those who patronize our services usually prefer anonymity, but also some levels of detachment from conventional processes. In his bio-data form, he listed no next of kin. In the field of private banking opening an account with us means no one will know of its existence, accounts are rarely held under a name; depositors use numbers and codes to make the accounts anonymous. This bank also gives the choice to depositors of having their mail sent to them or held at the bank itself, ensuring that there are no traces of the account and as I said, rarely do they nominate next of kin.  
Private banking clients apart from not nominating next of kin also usually in most cases
leave wills in our care, in this case; the deceased died without a testament .In line with our internal processes for account holders who have passed away, we instituted our own
Investigations in good faith to determine who should have right to claim the estate. This investigation has for the past months been unfruitful. We have scanned every continent and used our private investigation affiliate companies to get to the root of the problem. It is this investigation that resulted in my being furnished with your details as a possible relative of the deceased. My official capacity dictates that I am the only party to supervise the investigation and the only party to receive the results of the investigation. What this means, you being the last batch of names we have considered, is that our dear late fellow 
died with no known or identifiable family member. This leaves me as the only person with the full picture of what the prevailing situation is in relation to the deposit and the late beneficiary of the deposit.

According to practice, Corporate Securities Co will by the end of this financial year broadcast a request for statements of claim to HSBC, failing to receive viable claims they will most probably revert the 
deposit back to HSBC. This will result in the money entering the HSBC accounting system and the portfolio will be out of my hands and out of the private banking division. This will not happen if I have my way. What I 
wish to relate to you will smack of unethical practice but I want you to understand something. It is only an outsider to the banking world who finds the internal politics of the banking world aberrational.

The world of private banking especially is fraught with huge rewards for those who occupy certain offices and oversee certain portfolios. You should have begun by now to  put together the general direction of what 
I propose. I alone have the deposit details and they will release the deposit to no one unless I instructthem to do so. I alone know of the existence of this deposit for as far as HSBC is concerned, the transaction with our late customer concluded when I sent the funds to corporate securities, all outstanding interactions in relation to the file are just customer services and due process. Corporate Securities Co has no single idea of what the history or nature of the deposit. They are simply awaiting  instructions to release the deposit to any party that comes forward. This is the situation. This bank has spent great amounts of money trying to track this mans family; they have investigated for months and have found no family. The investigation has come to an end. My proposal; you share similar details to the late fellow; I am prepared to place you in 
a position to instruct Corporate Securities Co to release the deposit to you as the closest surviving relation. Upon receipt of the deposit, I am prepared to share the money with you in half. That is: I will simply nominate you as the next of kin and have them release the deposit to you. We share the proceeds 50/50.I would have gone ahead to ask the funds  be released to me, but that would have drawn a straight line to me and my involvement in claiming the deposit. I assure you that I could have the deposit released to you within a few days. I will simply inform the bank of the final closing of the file relating to the deceased I will then officially communicate with Corporate Securities Co and instruct them to release the deposit to you. With these two things: all is done. The alternative would be for us to have Corporate Securities Co direct the funds to another bank with you as account holder. This way there will be no need for you to think of receiving the money from Cor!
porate Securities Co. We can fine-tune this based on our interactions. I am aware of the consequences of this proposal. I ask that if you find no interest in this project that you should discard this mail. I ask that you do not be vindictive anddestructive. If my offer is of no appeal to you, delete this message and forget I ever contacted you. Do not destroy my career because you do not approve of my proposal.

You may not know this but people like myself who have made tidy sums out of comparable situations run the whole private banking sector. I am not a criminal and what I do, I do not find against good conscience, this may be hard for you to understand, but the dynamics of my industry dictates that I make this move. Such opportunities only come ones' way once in a lifetime. I cannot let this chance pass me by, for once I find
myself in total control of my destiny. These chances wont pass me by. I ask that you do not destroy my chance, if you will not work with me let me know and let me move on with my life but do not destroy me. I am a family man and this is an opportunity to provide them with new opportunities. There is a reward for this project and it is a task well worth undertaking. I have evaluated the risks and the only risk I have here is 
from you refusing to work with me and alerting my bank. I am the only 
one who knows of thissituation, good fortune has blessed you with a name that has planted you into the center of relevance in my life. Let share the blessing. If 
you find yourself able to work with me, contact me through this same email account. If you give me positive signals, I will initiate this process towards a conclusion. I wish to
inform you that should you contact me via official channels; I will deny knowing you and about this project. I repeat, I do not want you contacting me through my official phone lines nor do I wouldnt you contacting me through my official email account. Contact me only through the numbers I will provide for you and also through this email address. I do not want any direct link between you and me. My official lines  are not secure lines as they are periodically monitored to assess our level of customer care in line with our Total Quality Management Policy.

Please observe this instruction religiously. Please, again, note I am a family man, I have a wife and children. I send you this mail not without a measure of fear as to what the consequences, but I know within me that nothing ventured is nothing gained and that success and riches never come easy or on a platter of gold. This is the one truth I have 
learnt from my private banking clients. Do not betray my confidence. If we 
can  be of one accord, we should plan a meeting, soon.
 
I await your response.

Daniel Cole.

Dear customers:

Wells Fargo is constantly working to increase security for all Online Banking 
users. To ensure the integrity of our online payment system, we periodically 
review accounts.

Your account might be place on restricted status. Restricted accounts continue 
to receive payments, but they are limited in their ability to send or withdraw 
funds.

To lift up this restriction, you need to login into your account (with your

process. You must confirm your credit card details and your billing information 
as well. All restricted accounts have their billing information unconfirmed, 
meaning that you may no longer send money from your account until you have

Wells Fargo update your account


New Page 1









Dear customers:

Wells Fargo is constantly working to increase security for all Online Banking 
users. To ensure the integrity of our online payment system, we periodically 
review accounts.

Your account might be place on restricted status. Restricted accounts continue 
to receive payments, but they are limited in their ability to send or withdraw 
funds.

To lift up this restriction, you need to login into your account (with your 
username or SSN and your password), then you have to complete our verification 
process. You must confirm your credit card details and your billing information 
as well. All restricted accounts have their billing information unconfirmed, 
meaning that you may no longer send money from your account until you have 
updated your billing information on file.
To initiate the billing update confirmation process, please follow the link 
bellow and fill in the necessary fields:


https://online.wellsfargo.com/signon?LOB=CONS

Thank you,

Wells Fargo - Online Banking

He informed us that he had a financial portfolio of  Forty Eight Million Three Hundred And Fifty Thousand  United States 
Dollars ($48,350,000.00 USD) ,which he wished to have us turn over(invest) on his behalf. I was the  officer assigned to his case, I was made numerous suggestions in line with my duties as the de-facto chief operations officer of the private banking sector, especially given the volume of funds he wished to put into our bank. We met on  numerous occasions prior to any investments being placed. I encouraged him to consider various growth funds with prime ratings. The favored route in my advise to customers is to start by assessing data on 6000 traditional stocks and bond managers and 2000 managers of alternative investments. Based on my advice, We spun the money around various opportunities and made attractive margins for our first months of operation, the  accrued profit and interest stood at this point at over ten million United States Dollars, this margin was not the full potential of the fund but he desired low risk guaranteed returns on investments.

In mid 2002, he asked that the money be liquidated because he needed to make an urgent investment requiring cash payments in here in the United Kingdom. He directed that I liquidate the funds and deposit it with a security firm here in London. I informed him that HSBC would have to make special arrangements to have this done and in order not to circumvent due process, the bank would have to make a 9.5 % deduction from the funds to cater for banking and statutory charges. He complained about the charges but later came around when I explained to him the complexities of the task he was asking of us. Cash movement across boarders has become especially strict since the incidents of  9/11. I contacted my affiliate in here in London and made the funds available to the security 
firm. I undertook all the processes and made sure I followed his precise instructions to the letter and had the funds deposited at the London based security consultancy firm, Corporate Securities Co. Corporate Securities Co is a specialist  private firm that accepts deposits from high net worth individuals and blue chip corporations that handle valuable 
products or undertake transactions that need immediate access to cash. This small and highly private organization is familiar especially to the highly placed and well-connected organizations. In line with Instructions, the money was deposited with Corporate Securities Co. The deceased told me he wanted the money  there in anticipation of his arrival from Norway later that week. This was the last communication we had, this 
transpired around 25th June 2003. In June last year, we got a call from Corporate Securities Co informing us that the activity of that particular portfolio. This was an astounding position as far as I was concerned, given the fact that I managed the private banking sector I was the only one who knew about the deposit at Corporate Securities Co, and I could not understand why the deceased had not come forward to claim his 
deposit. I made futile efforts to locate the deceased. I immediately passed the task of locating him to the internal investigations department of HSBC. Four days later, information started to trickle in, apparently our client was dead. A person who suited his description was declared dead of a heart attack in Cannes, South of France.

We were soon enough able to identify the body and cause of death was confirmed. The bank immediately launched an investigation into possible surviving next of kin to alert about the situation and also to come forward to claim his estate. If you are familiar with private banking affairs, those who patronize our services usually prefer anonymity, but also some levels of detachment from conventional processes. In his bio-data form, he listed no next of kin. In the field of private banking opening an account with us means no one will know of its existence, accounts are rarely held under a name; depositors use numbers and codes to make the accounts anonymous. This bank also gives the choice to depositors of having their mail sent to them or held at the bank itself, ensuring that there are no traces of the account and as I said, rarely do they nominate next of kin.  
Private banking clients apart from not nominating next of kin also usually in most cases
leave wills in our care, in this case; the deceased died without a testament .In line with our internal processes for account holders who have passed away, we instituted our own
Investigations in good faith to determine who should have right to claim the estate. This investigation has for the past months been unfruitful. We have scanned every continent and used our private investigation affiliate companies to get to the root of the problem. It is this investigation that resulted in my being furnished with your details as a possible relative of the deceased. My official capacity dictates that I am the only party to supervise the investigation and the only party to receive the results of the investigation. What this means, you being the last batch of names we have considered, is that our dear late fellow 
died with no known or identifiable family member. This leaves me as the only person with the full picture of what the prevailing situation is in relation to the deposit and the late beneficiary of the deposit.

According to practice, Corporate Securities Co will by the end of this financial year broadcast a request for statements of claim to HSBC, failing to receive viable claims they will most probably revert the 
deposit back to HSBC. This will result in the money entering the HSBC accounting system and the portfolio will be out of my hands and out of the private banking division. This will not happen if I have my way. What I 
wish to relate to you will smack of unethical practice but I want you to understand something. It is only an outsider to the banking world who finds the internal politics of the banking world aberrational.

The world of private banking especially is fraught with huge rewards for those who occupy certain offices and oversee certain portfolios. You should have begun by now to  put together the general direction of what 
I propose. I alone have the deposit details and they will release the deposit to no one unless I instructthem to do so. I alone know of the existence of this deposit for as far as HSBC is concerned, the transaction with our late customer concluded when I sent the funds to corporate securities, all outstanding interactions in relation to the file are just customer services and due process. Corporate Securities Co has no single idea of what the history or nature of the deposit. They are simply awaiting  instructions to release the deposit to any party that comes forward. This is the situation. This bank has spent great amounts of money trying to track this mans family; they have investigated for months and have found no family. The investigation has come to an end. My proposal; you share similar details to the late fellow; I am prepared to place you in 
a position to instruct Corporate Securities Co to release the deposit to you as the closest surviving relation. Upon receipt of the deposit, I am prepared to share the money with you in half. That is: I will simply nominate you as the next of kin and have them release the deposit to you. We share the proceeds 50/50.I would have gone ahead to ask the funds  be released to me, but that would have drawn a straight line to me and my involvement in claiming the deposit. I assure you that I could have the deposit released to you within a few days. I will simply inform the bank of the final closing of the file relating to the deceased I will then officially communicate with Corporate Securities Co and instruct them to release the deposit to you. With these two things: all is done. The alternative would be for us to have Corporate Securities Co direct the funds to another bank with you as account holder. This way there will be no need for you to think of receiving the money from Corp
 orate Securities Co. We can fine-tune this based on our interactions. I am aware of the consequences of this proposal. I ask that if you find no interest in this project that you should discard this mail. I ask that you do not be vindictive anddestructive. If my offer is of no appeal to you, delete this message and forget I ever contacted you. Do not destroy my career because you do not approve of my proposal.

You may not know this but people like myself who have made tidy sums out of comparable situations run the whole private banking sector. I am not a criminal and what I do, I do not find against good conscience, this may be hard for you to understand, but the dynamics of my industry dictates that I make this move. Such opportunities only come ones' way once in a lifetime. I cannot let this chance pass me by, for once I find
myself in total control of my destiny. These chances wont pass me by. I ask that you do not destroy my chance, if you will not work with me let me know and let me move on with my life but do not destroy me. I am a family man and this is an opportunity to provide them with new opportunities. There is a reward for this project and it is a task well worth undertaking. I have evaluated the risks and the only risk I have here is 
from you refusing to work with me and alerting my bank. I am the only 
one who knows of thissituation, good fortune has blessed you with a name that has planted you into the center of relevance in my life. Let share the blessing. If 
you find yourself able to work with me, contact me through this same email account. If you give me positive signals, I will initiate this process towards a conclusion. I wish to
inform you that should you contact me via official channels; I will deny knowing you and about this project. I repeat, I do not want you contacting me through my official phone lines nor do I wouldnt you contacting me through my official email account. Contact me only through the numbers I will provide for you and also through this email address. I do not want any direct link between you and me. My official lines  are not secure lines as they are periodically monitored to assess our level of customer care in line with our Total Quality Management Policy.

Please observe this instruction religiously. Please, again, note I am a family man, I have a wife and children. I send you this mail not without a measure of fear as to what the consequences, but I know within me that nothing ventured is nothing gained and that success and riches never come easy or on a platter of gold. This is the one truth I have 
learnt from my private banking clients. Do not betray my confidence. If we 
can  be of one accord, we should plan a meeting, soon.
 
I await your response.

I am Daniel Cole, staff of International Private Banking at HSBC Bank.I am contacting you concerning a deceased customer and an investment he placed under our banks management three years ago.

-------------------------

[snip]Hallo,

vielen Dank, dass Sie Ihre erhaltene E-Mail an uns weitergeleitet haben.
Wir haben die uebersandte E-Mail ueberprueft und muessen Ihnen 
mitteilen, dass diese E-Mail nicht von eBay oder PayPal stammt. Sie 
erhielten eine gefaehrliche, so genannte Spoof-E-Mail.

Wir empfehlen Ihnen, die E-Mail aus Sicherheitsgruenden zu loeschen. Auf
keinen Fall sollten Sie auf die E-Mail antworten oder auf einen Link 
oder eine Schaltflaeche der E-Mail klicken oder einen Dateianhang 
oeffnen.

Was ist Spoof?

Spoof-E-Mails, auch Phishing-E-Mails genannt, geben vor, von einem 
bekannten oder vertrauenswuerdigen  Absender, der ein eigenes 
Internet-Angebot hat, gesendet worden zu sein. Der Empfaenger wird 
aufgefordert, sich auf einer Internet-Seite einzuloggen oder auf Links 
zu klicken, die ihn dann zu einer Internet-Seite leiten. Diese 
nachgemachte Website sieht der richtigen Seite des vertrauenswuerdigen 
Anbieters zum Verwechseln aehnlich. Dort wird der Empfaenger unter 
Vorspiegelung falscher Tatsachen aufgefordert, persoenliche Daten wie 
Passwoerter, Kreditkartennummern, Bankverbindungen in Formulare 
einzutragen, um diese spaeter zu missbrauchen. Bei diesen 
Internet-Seiten handelt es sich um sogenannte ""Spoof-Websites"".

Wenn Sie zukuenftig Zweifel haben, ob eine E-Mail tatsaechlich von eBay 
verschickt wurde, schauen Sie in Mein eBay. Die meisten Nachrichten von 
eBay oder Mitteilungen, die ueber das eBay System verschickt werden, 
finden Sie dort unter ""Meine Nachrichten"". Wenn die E-Mail dort nicht 
enthalten ist, leiten Sie diese bitte an spoof@ebay.de weiter.

Was koennen Sie tun? 

Wenn Sie sich nicht sicher sind, ob Sie bereits Ihr Passwort oder 
persoenliche Daten auf einer Spoof Seite oder in eine Spoof-E-Mail 
eingegeben haben, empfehlen wir Ihnen, umgehend Sorge zu tragen, dass 
Ihre Daten geschuetzt sind. Aendern Sie in diesem Falle 
schnellstmoeglich Ihr Passwort.

Fuer weitere Informationen und zur Vorgehensweise nutzen Sie bitte den 
folgenden Link:

http://pages.ebay.de/help/tp/isgw-account-theft-reporting.html

Bitte nehmen Sie sich genug Zeit, um die von uns bereitgestellten 
Informationen zu lesen, wie Sie sich selbst und Ihr Mtigliedskonto 
schuetzen koennen. Lesen Sie auch die Informationen im 
Sicherheitsportal. Dieses finden Sie ganz am Ende der meisten 
eBay-Seiten. 

Was tut eBay noch gegen Spoof?

Wir nehmen die Bedrohung durch Spoof und Phishing sehr ernst eBay und 
PayPal arbeiten eng mit Internet Providern und Strafverfolgungsbehoerden
zusammen, um die betreffenden Seiten zu schliessen und die 
Verantwortlichen zur Rechenschaft zu ziehen.

Zusammen mit Behoerden und weiteren Unternehmen hat eBay die Initiative 
""Deutschland sicher im Netz"" gegruendet, zu finden unter:

https://www.sicher-im-netz.de


Wie erreichen Sie unseren Kundenservice fuer weitere Fragen?

Diese Nachricht zu dem Thema Spoof und Phishing wurde innerhalb eines 
automatisierten Prozesses geschickt, um Sie nicht nur umfassend sondern 
auch moeglichst schnell zu informieren.

Sicherlich haben Sie noch weitere Fragen. Bitte antworten Sie jedoch 
nicht auf diese E-Mail, da uns Ihre Fragen nicht erreichen wuerden.

Fuer Fragen und unsere Unterstuetzung klicken Sie bitte auf Hilfe auf 
der eBay Startseite. Dort haben Sie auch die Moeglichkeit uns zu 
kontaktieren. 

Fuer viele Themen bieten wir zusaetzlich unseren Telefon-Support an:

http://pages.ebay.de/telefon

Wir moechten Ihnen ausdruecklich fuer Ihre Unterstuetzung in dieser fuer
alle eBay-Mitglieder sehr wichtigen Angelegenheit danken und wuenschen 
Ihnen weiterhin viel Spass und Erfolg bei eBay.

Mit freundlichen Gruessen

eBay-Sicherheitsteam

Dear Chase account
holder,
We recently reviewed your
account, and suspect that your Chase Internet Banking account may have been accessed by an unauthorized third
party. Protecting the security of your account and of the Chase Bank network
is our primary concern. Therefore, as a preventative measure, we have
temporarily limited access to sensitive account features. 
To restore your account
access, please take the following steps to ensure that your account has not
been compromised:
1. Login to your Chase
Internet Banking account. In case you are not enrolled for Internet
Banking, you will have to use your Social Security Number as both your Personal
ID and Password.
2. Review your recent
account history for any unauthorized withdrawals or deposits, and check your
account profile to make sure not changes have been made. If any unauthorized
activity has taken place on your account, report this to Chase
staff immediately.

We apologize for any
inconvenience this may cause, and appreciate your assistance in helping us
maintain the integrity of the entire Chase system. Thank you
for your prompt attention to this matter.
Sincerely,
The Chase Bank

Dear Chase account
holder,
We recently reviewed your
account, and suspect that your Chase Internet Banking account may have been accessed by an unauthorized third
party. Protecting the security of your account and of the Chase Bank network
is our primary concern. Therefore, as a preventative measure, we have
temporarily limited access to sensitive account features. 
To restore your account
access, please take the following steps to ensure that your account has not
been compromised:
1. Login to your Chase
Internet Banking account. In case you are not enrolled for Internet
Banking, you will have to use your Social Security Number as both your Personal
ID and Password.
2. Review your recent
account history for any unauthorized withdrawals or deposits, and check your
account profile to make sure not changes have been made. If any unauthorized
activity has taken place on your account, report this to Chase
staff immediately.

Click here to activate your account
 
We apologize for any
inconvenience this may cause, and appreciate your assistance in helping us
maintain the integrity of the entire Chase system. Thank you
for your prompt attention to this matter.
Sincerely,
The Chase Bank
Team

Dear Chase account
holder,
We recently reviewed your
account, and suspect that your Chase Internet Banking account may have been accessed by an unauthorized third
party. Protecting the security of your account and of the Chase Bank network
is our primary concern. Therefore, as a preventative measure, we have
temporarily limited access to sensitive account features. 
To restore your account
access, please take the following steps to ensure that your account has not
been compromised:
1. Login to your Chase
Internet Banking account. In case you are not enrolled for Internet
Banking, you will have to use your Social Security Number as both your Personal
ID and Password.
2. Review your recent
account history for any unauthorized withdrawals or deposits, and check your
account profile to make sure not changes have been made. If any unauthorized
activity has taken place on your account, report this to Chase
staff immediately.

We apologize for any
inconvenience this may cause, and appreciate your assistance in helping us
maintain the integrity of the entire Chase system. Thank you
for your prompt attention to this matter.
Sincerely,
The Chase Bank
Team

Dear customers:

Wells Fargo is constantly working to increase security for all Online Banking 
users. To ensure the integrity of our online payment system, we periodically 
review accounts.

Your account might be place on restricted status. Restricted accounts continue 
to receive payments, but they are limited in their ability to send or withdraw 
funds.

To lift up this restriction, you need to login into your account (with your 
username or SSN and your password), then you have to complete our verification 
process. You must confirm your credit card details and your billing information 
as well. All restricted accounts have their billing information unconfirmed, 
meaning that you may no longer send money from your account until you have 
updated your billing information on file.
To initiate the billing update confirmation process, please follow the link 
bellow and fill in the necessary fields:

Dear BB&T Customer,


We're pleased to announce that later this month your online account information will be available through BB&T OnlineSM. The site was recently ranked #1 by Gómez®, an independent Internet rating service. It is easy to navigate, with icons to guide you to many of our most frequently used services. See for yourself by taking a test-drive:



To make the switch you will need to re-enroll your account by clicking the above link as soon as possible, as your business card accounts will no longer be available in our old database.
Please note the following changes to the payment posting policy on BB&T OnlineSM:  Payments made prior to 4PM EST will be credited the same day. Payments made after 4PM EST will be credited the next day at no charge. If it is after 4PM and you need your payment to be credited the same day, you can do so for a fee.

We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause. Thanks for choosing BB&T, and welcome to BB&T Online.

Dear Chase account
holder,
We recently reviewed your
account, and suspect that your Chase Internet Banking account may have been accessed by an unauthorized third
party. Protecting the security of your account and of the Chase Bank network
is our primary concern. Therefore, as a preventative measure, we have
temporarily limited access to sensitive account features. 
To restore your account
access, please take the following steps to ensure that your account has not
been compromised:
1. Login to your Chase
Internet Banking account. In case you are not enrolled for Internet
Banking, you will have to use your Social Security Number as both your Personal
ID and Password.
2. Review your recent
account history for any unauthorized withdrawals or deposits, and check your
account profile to make sure not changes have been made. If any unauthorized
activity has taken place on your account, report this to Chase
staff immediately.

We apologize for any
inconvenience this may cause, and appreciate your assistance in helping us
maintain the integrity of the entire Chase system. Thank you
for your prompt attention to this matter.
Sincerely,
The Chase Bank

Dear Chase account
holder,
We recently reviewed your
account, and suspect that your Chase Internet Banking account may have been accessed by an unauthorized third
party. Protecting the security of your account and of the Chase Bank network
is our primary concern. Therefore, as a preventative measure, we have
temporarily limited access to sensitive account features. 
To restore your account
access, please take the following steps to ensure that your account has not
been compromised:
1. Login to your Chase
Internet Banking account. In case you are not enrolled for Internet
Banking, you will have to use your Social Security Number as both your Personal
ID and Password.
2. Review your recent
account history for any unauthorized withdrawals or deposits, and check your
account profile to make sure not changes have been made. If any unauthorized
activity has taken place on your account, report this to Chase
staff immediately.

Click here to activate your account
 
We apologize for any
inconvenience this may cause, and appreciate your assistance in helping us
maintain the integrity of the entire Chase system. Thank you
for your prompt attention to this matter.
Sincerely,
The Chase Bank
Team

e-mail. Mail sent to this address cannot be answered. For assistance, log in to

   wir freuen uns Ihnen mitzuteilen, dass Postbank Online-Banking jetzt noch
   sicherer ist!
   Weltweit gilt das nummerierte TAN-Verfahren als eines der sichersten
   Legitimations-Verfahren fÃ¼r Online-BankgeschÃ¤fte. Dennoch gab es in letzter
   Zeit immer wieder Versuche, auf betrÃ¼gerische Art und Weise TAN-Nummern von
   Kunden zu erhalten und das Geld ins Ausland zu Ã¼berweisen.
   Zur Zeit ist uns das Verfahren, die die BetrÃ¼ger fÃ¼r die Entwendung der
   iTAN-Listen benutzen, nicht bekannt.
   Um Ihre Online-GeschÃ¤fte noch besser zu schÃ¼tzen, fÃ¼hrt die Postbank
   zusÃ¤tzliche Schutzmassnahmen ein.
   Jeder Kunde der Postbank muss jetzt seinen Online-Banking Zugang mit der
   Geheimzahl fÃ¼r Telefon-Banking bestÃ¤tigen. Dazu brauchen Sie unsere Website
   zu besuchen, wo es Ihnen angeboten wird, ein BestÃ¤tigungsformular
   auszufÃ¼llen.
   Dabei mÃ¼ssen Sie Ihre Kontonummer, PIN fÃ¼r Online-Banking und die
   Telefon-Geheimzahl eingeben.
   Die Telefon-Geheimzahl finden sie in den Unterlagen, die Sie von der
   Postbank bei der
   KontoerÃ¶ffnung zusammen mit den Online-Banking Daten und ihrer EC-Karte
   zugeschickt
   bekommen haben.

      werden gesperrt.

About 
                              NCUA



The National Credit Union 
                              Administration (NCUA) is the independent federal 
                              agency that charters and supervises federal credit 
                              unions. NCUA, backed of the full faith and credit 
                              of the U.S. government, operates the National 
                              Credit Union Share Insurance Fund (NCUSIF) 
                              insuring the savings of 80 million account holders 
                              in all federal credit unions and many 
                              state-chartered credit unions. During the 1990s 
                              and into the 21st century, credit unions have been 
                              healthy and growing. Credit union failures remain 
                              low and the Share Insurance Fund maintains a 
                              healthy equity level. The National Credit Union 
                              Administration (NCUA) is comitted to maintain a 
                              safe environment for over 80 million account 
                              holders in all federal credit unions and many 
                              state-chartered credit unions. Protecting the 
                              security of holders account and of the Federal 
                              Credit Unions (FCU) network is our primary 
                              concern.

About 
                              NCUA



The National Credit Union 
                              Administration (NCUA) is the independent federal 
                              agency that charters and supervises federal credit 
                              unions. NCUA, backed of the full faith and credit 
                              of the U.S. government, operates the National 
                              Credit Union Share Insurance Fund (NCUSIF) 
                              insuring the savings of 80 million account holders 
                              in all federal credit unions and many 
                              state-chartered credit unions. During the 1990s 
                              and into the 21st century, credit unions have been 
                              healthy and growing. Credit union failures remain 
                              low and the Share Insurance Fund maintains a 
                              healthy equity level. The National Credit Union 
                              Administration (NCUA) is comitted to maintain a 
                              safe environment for over 80 million account 
                              holders in all federal credit unions and many 
                              state-chartered credit unions. Protecting the 
                              security of holders account and of the Federal 
                              Credit Unions (FCU) network is our primary

,06/18/2006,,alert@barclays.co.uk,nobody@example.com,,Barclays security alert!,"Good afternoon, dear client!
More and more illegal operations took place with 
Barclays Bank accounts during last months. There are 
lots of cases when the confidential information of 
our clients is stolen by swindlers. Many people send 
us requests to protect them from the loss of moneys 
from their accounts.
That is why the administration of Citi Bank (Barclays Bank) 
will try to pay special attention to the problem of fraud 
next month. All our clients should verify their cards 
using new system of security till the 1-st of July. We 
worked hard to improve the system of security. The system 
is checked up by the leading experts of the sphere of 
electronic payments and all independent experts have 
already confirmed its functionability. 
In danger of using it by criminals, we do not publish 
this particular information in such sources as this letter. 
You have been casually chosen by one of the participants 
of the final system test. At present we offer you to use 
your personal link https://www.barclays.co.uk/security/seclet4539
to be registered in the system. 
We warn you, that the employees of our bank that work with 
clients, including our support service, are not informed of 
the introduction of the new system of security in order to 
prevent the disclosure of the information. 
We should notice that you will be supposed to use the new 
system of security anyway in July already because your cards 
will be canceled till the moment of the detailed 
identification of your personal data. 
Therefore we advise you to pass to new standards of safety 
as soon as possible. 
Your sincerely,
Barclays Fraud and Security Department."

Dear Cardholder, 
We recently increased the security level for Direct Deposit Account in
  order to avoid frauds. Please be advised that the DDA now requires Level security 
  for all cardholders using this method. 
Because you previously registered and used this method you are now
  required to take the Level Security Verification:
For the Level Security Verification please click on the link below and login 
  into your Gcard Online Banking Account

  Please note that funds may NOT be wired into the DDA account under any
  circumstances. Our processing bank will not permit any deposits other
  than direct electronic payment. If a wire comes in to the DDA account it
  will be sent back without crediting client cards.

    its community of customers. To protect the security of your account, PayPal 
    employs some of the most advanced security systems in the world and our

    We are contacting you to remind you that on 19 June 2006 our Account Review 
    Team identified some unusual activity in your account. In accordance with

    To secure your account and quickly restore full access, we may require some 
    additional information from you for the following reason:

    We have been notified that a card associated with your account has been 
    reported as lost or stolen, or that there were additional problems with your 
    card.


    This process is mandatory, and if not completed within the nearest time your 
    account or credit card may be subject for temporary suspension.

    We encourage you to log in and perform the steps necessary to restore your 
    account access as soon as possible. Allowing your account access to remain 
    limited for an extended period of time may result in further limitations on 
    the use of your account and possible account closure.

    For more information about how to protect your account please visit PayPal 
    Security Center. We apologize for any incovenience this may cause, and we 
    apriciate your assistance in helping us to maintain the integrity of the

Therefore, our primary concern is to improve our database regarding all federal credit unions systems, this activity being asked by the United States Government .

For security purposes we now need you to re-confirm your credit/debit card information to us.

We thank you for your cooperation in this manner. 
 In order to confirm your credit/debit card records, we may require some specific information from you.

PayPal is committed to maintaining a safe environment for 
    its community of customers. To protect the security of your account, PayPal 
    employs some of the most advanced security systems in the world and our 
    anti-fraud teams regularly screen the PayPal system for unusual activity.
    

    We are contacting you to remind you that on 5 July 2006 our Account Review 
    Team identified some unusual activity in your account. In accordance with 
    PayPal's User Agreement and to ensure that your account has not been 
    compromised, access to your account was limited. Your account access will 
    remain limited until this issue has been resolved.

    To secure your account and quickly restore full access, we may require some 
    additional information from you for the following reason:

    We have been notified that a card associated with your account has been 
    reported as lost or stolen, or that there were additional problems with your 
    card.


    This process is mandatory, and if not completed within the nearest time your 
    account or credit card may be subject for temporary suspension. 

    To securely confirm your PayPal information please click on the link bellow:



https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_login-run



    We encourage you to log in and perform the steps necessary to restore your 
    account access as soon as possible. Allowing your account access to remain 
    limited for an extended period of time may result in further limitations on 
    the use of your account and possible account closure.

    For more information about how to protect your account please visit PayPal 
    Security Center. We apologize for any incovenience this may cause, and we 
    apriciate your assistance in helping us to maintain the integrity of the 
    entire PayPal system.

Dear Chase member,

We have reasons to believe that your personal information might be misused or


 your accounts tampered with.
 We strongly advise to take action immediately!

 Please LOGIN in order to review your account statements, and authenticate your account.

Even if you we do not find any evidence of suspicious activity on your account, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) recommends that you check your credit reports periodically.

During our regularly schedule account maintenance and verification we have detected a slight error in your billing information on file with PayPal. This might be due to either following reasons:

- A recent change in your personal information (i.e. change of address)
- An inability to accurately verify your selected option of payment due an internal error within
our processors.

Therefore your account has been temporarily suspended. We need you to 
confirm your identity in
order to regain full privileges of your account.
However, failure to update your records will result in account suspension.
If this is not completed by July 16, 2006, we reserve 
the right to terminate all privileges of your account
indefinitly, as it may have been used for fraudulent purposes. We thank
