,09/01/2015,,,,,Thanks for choosing Stripe,"Hi ,

Thanks for choosing Stripe--we really appreciate it!

One of the primary reasons we can get users up and running so quickly is our rather unique registration process. Whenever you sign up for a Stripe account, we use the information you enter to verify both your website and the person signing up for the account.

That said, it seems we're running into a small issue verifying your identity--unfortunately the systems we use sometimes need a bit more information to retrieve a match. Please Kindly click on Verify  to confirm your Identity, once done, you'll be all set, and we'll be sure to reach out if we ever need any other information about your account!




Thanks for bearing with us on this one.

Best,
Stripe"
