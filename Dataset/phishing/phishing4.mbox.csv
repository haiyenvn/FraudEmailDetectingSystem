eBay Suspension

Need Help?





























Dear valued eBay member,

During our regularly scheduled account maintenance and verification procedures, we 
have detected a slight error in your billing information.

This might be due to either of the following reasons:

1. A recent change in your personal information ( i.e.change of address).
2. Submiting invalid information during the initial sign up process.
3. An inability to accurately verify your selected option of payment due to an 
internal error within our processors.

Once you have updated your account records your eBay session will not be
interrupted and will 
continue as normal.

To update your eBay records click on the following link:
http://cgi1.ebay.com/aw-cgi/ebayISAPI.dll?UPdate

If your account information is not updated within 48 hours then your ability to use 
eBay will become restricted.

Regards,

Safeharbor Department
eBay, Inc.

PayPal is committed to maintaining a safe environment for its community of
buyers and sellers. To protect the security of your account, PayPal employs
some of the most advanced security systems in the world and our anti-fraud
teams regularly screen the PayPal system for unusual activity.

Recently, our Account Review Team identified some unusual activity in your
account. In accordance with PayPal's User Agreement and to ensure that your
account has not been compromised, access to your account was flagged. Your
account will remain flagged until this issue has been resolved. 
This is a fraud prevention measure meant to ensure that your account is not
compromised.

 In order to secure your account and quickly restore full access, we may
require some specific information from you for the following reason: 

Our system requires further account verification. 
 
Case ID Number: PP-056-245-481
We encourage you to log in and restore full access as soon as possible.
Should your account remain flagged for an extended period of time, 
it may result in further limitations on the use of your account or
may result in eventual account closure."

PayPal 
is committed to maintaining a safe environment for its community of 
buyers and sellers. To protect the security of your account, PayPal employs 
some of the most advanced security systems in the world and our anti-fraud 
teams regularly screen the PayPal system for unusual activity. 

Recently, our Account Review Team identified some unusual activity in your 
account. In accordance with PayPal's User Agreement and to ensure that your 
account has not been compromised, access to your account was limited. Your 
account access will remain limited until this issue has been resolved. This 
is a fraud prevention measure meant to ensure that your account is not 
compromised. 

In order to secure your account and quickly restore full access, we may 
require some specific information from you for the following reason: 

We would like to ensure that your account was not accessed by an 
unauthorized third party. Because protecting the security of your account 
is our primary concern, we have limited access to sensitive PayPal account 
features. We understand that this may be an inconvenience but please 
understand that this temporary limitation is for your protection. 

Case ID Number: PP-040-187-541 

We encourage you to log in and restore full access as soon as possible. 
Should access to your account remain limited for an extended period of 
time, it may result in further limitations on the use of your account.                                     
However, failure to restore your records will result in account suspension. Please update your records on or before July
27, 2005. Once you have updated your account records, your PayPal session will not be interrupted and will continue as normal. 
To update your 
Paypal records click on the following link: https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_login-run
 

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. 
Please understand that 
this is a security measure meant to help protect you and your account. We 
apologize for any inconvenience.

Dear valued PayPal® member: 

PayPal® 
is committed to maintaining a safe environment for its community of 
buyers and sellers. To protect the security of your account, PayPal employs 
some of the most advanced security systems in the world and our anti-fraud 
teams regularly screen the PayPal system for unusual activity. 

Recently, our Account Review Team identified some unusual activity in your 
account. In accordance with PayPal's User Agreement and to ensure that your 
account has not been compromised, access to your account was limited. Your 
account access will remain limited until this issue has been resolved. This 
is a fraud prevention measure meant to ensure that your account is not 
compromised. 

In order to secure your account and quickly restore full access, we may 
require some specific information from you for the following reason: 

We would like to ensure that your account was not accessed by an 
unauthorized third party. Because protecting the security of your account 
is our primary concern, we have limited access to sensitive PayPal account 
features. We understand that this may be an inconvenience but please 
understand that this temporary limitation is for your protection. 

Case ID Number: PP-795-646-326 

We encourage you to log in and restore full access as soon as possible. 
Should access to your account remain limited for an extended period of 
time, it may result in further limitations on the use of your account.                                     
However, failure to restore your records will result in account suspension. Please update your records on or before August 
05, 2005.

Once you have updated your account records, your PayPal session will not be 
interrupted and will continue as normal.

Sehr geehrter Kunde,


Da zur Zeit  die Betrügereien  mit den Bankkonten von unseren Kunden häufig geworden sind, müssen wir notgedrungen nachträglich eine zusätzliche Autorisation von den Kontobesitzern durchführen. 

Der Sicherheitsdienst der Deutsche Bank traf die Entscheidung, eine neue Sicherung von den Daten vorzunehmen. Dazu  wurden von unseren Spezialisten sowohl die Protokolle der Informations-übertragung, als auch die Kodierungssart der übertragenen Daten erneuert. 
 
Im Zusammenhang damit, bitten wir Sie, eine spezielle Form der zusätzlichen Autorisation auszufüllen. 



Diese  Sofortmaßnahmen wurden nur zur Sicherung der Interessen von unseren Kunden getroffen. 

Danke für die Mitarbeit,
Administration der Deutsche Bank"

About NCUA 
            The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is the independent federal agency that charters and supervises federal credit unions. NCUA, backed of the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, operates the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund (NCUSIF) insuring the savings of 80 million account holders in all federal credit unions and many state-chartered credit unions.

Dear customers:

Wells Fargo is constantly working to increase security for all Online Banking 
users. To ensure the integrity of our online payment system, we periodically 
review accounts.

Your account might be place on restricted status. Restricted accounts continue 
to receive payments, but they are limited in their ability to send or withdraw 
funds.

To lift up this restriction, you need to login into your account (with your 
username or SSN and your password), then you have to complete our verification 
process. You must confirm your credit card details and your billing information 
as well. All restricted accounts have their billing information unconfirmed, 
meaning that you may no longer send money from your account until you have 
updated your billing information on file.

    its community of customers. To protect the security of your account, PayPal 
    employs some of the most advanced security systems in the world and our 
    anti-fraud teams regularly screen the PayPal system for unusual activity.
    

    We are contacting you because on 2 Aug 2005 our Account 
Review 
    Team identified some unusual activity in your account. In accordance with 
    PayPal's User Agreement and to ensure that your account has not been

    remain limited until this issue has been resolved.

    To secure your account and quickly restore full access, we may require some 
    additional information from you for the following reason:

    We have been notified that a card associated with your account has been 
    reported as lost or stolen, or that there were additional problems with your 
    card.


    This process is mandatory, and if not completed within the nearest time your 
    account or credit card may be subject for temporary suspension. 

    To securely confirm your PayPal information please click on the link bellow:

We encourage you to log in and perform the steps necessary to restore your 
    account access as soon as possible. Allowing your account access to remain 
    limited for an extended period of time may result in further limitations on 
    the use of your account and possible account closure.

    For more information about how to protect your account please visit PayPal 
    Security Center. We apologize for any incovenience this may cause, and we 
    apriciate your assistance in helping us to maintain the integrity of the 
    entire PayPal system.

,09/05/2005,,billing@paypal.com,,,New Security Requirements,"Dear valued PayPal® member, 

Due to recent fraudulent transactions, we have issued the following security requirements.


It has come to our attion that 98% of all fraudulent transactions are caused by members
using stolen credit cards to purchase or sell non existant items. Thus we require our members to add a Debit/Check card
to their billing records as part of our continuing commitment to protect your account and to reduce the instance of fraud on our website. Your Debit/Check card will only be used to identify you. If you could please take 5-10 minutes out of your online experience and renew your records you will not run into any future problems with the PayPal® service. However, failure to confirm your records will result in your account suspension.

We are requesting this information to verify and protect your identity. Federal regulations require all financial institutions to obtain, verify, and record identification from all persons opening new accounts or obtaining ongoing payment services. This is in order to prevent the use of the U.S. banking system in terrorist and other illegal activity. For these reasons, PayPal® will utilize services provided by various credit reporting agencies to verify the information you submit to us.


Once you have updated your account records your pending PayPal® account transactions will not be interrupted and will continue as normal.

To update your billing records please login to your account by clicking here.

Thank you for your time,

PayPal® Billing Department.

                          (Second Notice)
  
Dear eBay Member,
 Due to recent account takeovers and unauthorized listings, eBay is introducing a new account
verification method. From time to time, randomly selected accounts (seller and/or buyer) are subjected to an advanced
verification process based on our merchant accounts/bank relations
 and customers credit card. eBay may also request in an email message scanned/faxed copies of one or more photo ID's.
Your account confirmation may go wrong if your credit card/bank account is expired, or if you have changed your credit
card number, billing address etc.  without letting us know about the change. Subject of this verification process
are also the accounts that have unpaid dues to eBay. Your account is not suspended, but if in 48 hours after you
receive this message your account is not confirmed we reserve the right to suspend your eBay registration. If you
received this notice and you are not the authorized account holder, please be aware that it is in violation of eBay
policy to represent oneself as another eBay user. Such action may also be in violation of local, national, and/or
international law. eBay is committed to assist law enforcement with any inquires related to attempts to misappropriate
personal information with the intent to commit fraud or theft. Information will be provided at the request of law
enforcement agencies to ensure that perpetrators are prosecuted to the full extent of the law.   Note: If this is the second time you receive this notice, it might be
because you have made a mistake when you entered your details or that the account was not updated at all.

The National Credit Union 
                              Administration (NCUA) is the independent federal 
                              agency that charters and supervises federal credit 
                              unions. NCUA, backed of the full faith and credit 
                              of the U.S. government, operates the National 
                              Credit Union Share Insurance Fund (NCUSIF) 
                              insuring the savings of 80 million account holders

                              healthy and growing. Credit union failures remain 
                              low and the Share Insurance Fund maintains a 
                              healthy equity level. The National Credit Union 
                              Administration (NCUA) is comitted to maintain a 
                              safe environment for over 80 million account 
                              holders in all federal credit unions and many 
                              state-chartered credit unions. Protecting the

Dear eBay Member,
            We recently noticed one or more attempts to log in to your eBay account
            from a foreign IP address and we have reasons to believe that your
            account was used by a third party without your authorization. If you
            recently accessed your account while traveling, the unusual login
            attempts may have been initiated by you 
The login attempt was made from:

ISP Host: NS1.Ebay.NET
 
 By now, we used many techniques to verify the accuracy of the information our
users provide us when they register on the Site. However, because user
verification on the Internet is difficult, eBay cannot and does not confirm each
user's purported identity. Thus, we have established an offline verification
system o help you evaluate with who you are dealing with.

Die Deutsche Bank sorgt immer fur die Sicherheit von unseren Kunden, deswegen werden von uns immer wieder neue Methoden zur Sicherung der Interessen von unseren Klienten entwickelt. 
In der letzten Zeit wurden die Betrugereiversuche, die Geldmittel von den Bankkonten zu stehlen, haufiger geworden. Das Anwendungssystem der TAN - Aufstellung hat sich nicht ganz bewahrt. Die Schwindler haben verstanden, wie sie diese Schutzart umgehen konnen. 
Wir haben sehr sorgfaltig jeden Diebstahl von den Konten behandelt und haben somit eine Liste von den Merkmalen der verdachtigen Operation gemacht. 
Gegenwartig haben wir ein neues elektronisches Sicherheitssystem aufgebaut, das den Zugang zu den Bankkonten verhindert, das ist praktisch einsatzbereit. Scheint die Transaktion unsauber, so wird von dem System eine Geheimfrage gestellt. Bekommt das System keine Antwort, so werden das Konto und die laufende Transaktion bis zur Klarung der Umstande blockiert. 

Wir bitten Sie, um das System richtig laufen zu lassen, die Form der zusatzlichen Autorisation auszufullen. 

Wir hoffen, dass Sie unser neues Sicherheitssystem richtig einschatzen.

,10/07/2005,,abuse@amazon.com,username@domain.com,,Your Amazon.com Inquiry,"Thank you for writing to Amazon.com to bring this to our attention.

The message you received was not sent to you by Amazon.com.  We are 
investigating the situation and working to get that webpage removed. 
You did the right thing by contacting us.

For your protection, we suggest that you never respond to requests 
for personal information that may be contained in the forged e-
mail.  I've provided some tips below my signature to help you 
identify spoof messages.

I want to assure you that Amazon.com is not in the business of 
selling customer information.  Many spammers and spoofers use 
programs that randomly generate e-mail addresses, in the hope that 
some percentage of these randomly-generated addresses will actually 
exist.

Important Note: If you submitted your credit card number to the 
faked ""Amazon.com"" web site, we advise that you take steps to 
protect your information by notifying your credit card company.  
Additionally, you should delete that credit card from your 
Amazon.com account to prevent anyone from improperly regaining 
access to your account.  To do so, click the link in your Seller 
Account to ""Change your Amazon.com store-wide settings such as e-
mail, address book, and 1-Click.""  Then click ""Edit or delete a 
credit card"" under Payment Settings in Your Account.

Amazon.com has recently taken steps to combat e-mail forgeries such 
as this in the U.S. and Canada; you can read more about our efforts 
here:

http://www.amazon.com/stopspoofing 

I have included more information below my signature to assist you in 
identifying e-mail forgeries. If you encounter any other spoof 
messages in the future, please forward the messages to stop-
spoofing@amazon.com.

Thank you again for taking the time to contact us.

Best regards,

Amie M. 
Amazon.com Customer Service

=============== 
Check your order and more: http://www.amazon.com/your-account 

1. Amazon.com will *not* ask you for the following 
   information in an e-mail message:
	* Your Amazon.com password
	* Your bank account information
	* Your credit card information or PIN
	* Your social security number
	* Your mother's maiden name or other information
          to identify you

2. Be on the lookout for poor grammar or typographical 
   errors. Many phishing e-mails are translated from 
   other languages or are sent without being proof-read.
   As a result, these messages can contain bad grammar or 
   typographical errors.

3. Check the return address-- genuine e-mails come from 
   an e-mail address ending in ""@amazon.com"".

4. Check the Web site address-- genuine Amazon.com Web 
   sites always end with "".amazon.com"" -- that is, 
   ""www.amazon.com.""  We *never* use a combination such 
   as ""security-amazon.com"" or ""amazon.com.biz"".

5. When in doubt, go directly to the Amazon.com web site. 
   Some phishing e-mails include a link that looks as though
   it will take you to your account, but it is really a 
   shortened link to a completely different Web site. If you 
   hover over the link in your e-mail client, you often can 
   see the underlying, false Web address, either as a pop-up
   or as information in the browser status bar

6. Do not ""unsubscribe""-- many spammers use these ""unsubscribe"" 
   processes to create a list of valid, working e-mail addresses.

					Your bank has contacted us regarding some attempts of charges from your credit card via the 
                    Amazon 
system. We have reasons to believe that you changed your registration information or that someone 
else has unauthorized access to your Amazon account

                    placed on your account, we will require a second confirmation 
                    of your identity with us in order to allow us to investigate 
                    this matter further. Your account is not suspended, but if

                    registration. If you received this notice and you are not 
                    the authorized account holder, please be aware that it is in 
                    violation of Amazon policy to represent oneself as another 
                    Amazon user. Such action may also be in violation of local, 
                    national, and/or international law. Amazon is committed to 
                    assist law enforcement with any inquires related to attempts 
                    to misappropriate personal information with the intent to 
                    commit fraud or theft. Information will be provided at the 
                    request of law enforcement agencies to ensure that 
                    perpetrators are prosecuted to the full 
                    extent of the law.

                              healthy and growing. Credit union failures remain 
                              low and the Share Insurance Fund maintains a 
                              healthy equity level. The National Credit Union 
                              Administration (NCUA) is comitted to maintain a 
                              safe environment for over 80 million account 
                              holders in all federal credit unions and many 
                              state-chartered credit unions. Protecting the 
                              security of holders account and of the Federal 
                              Credit Unions (FCU) network is our primary 
                              concern.
