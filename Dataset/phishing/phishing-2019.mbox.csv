You have the last chance to save your social life - I am not kidding!!

I give you the last 72 hours to make the payment, before I send
the video with your masturbation to all your friends and associates.

The last time you visited a erotic website with young Teens,
you downloaded and installed the software I developed.

My program has turned on your camera and recorded your act of
Masturbation and the video you were masturbating to.
My software also downloaded all your email contact lists
and a list of your Facebook friends.

I have both the 'Info.mp4' with your masturbation
and a file with all your contacts on my hard drive.
You are very perverted!

If you want me to delete both files and keep your secret,
you must send me Bitcoin payment. I give you the last 72 hours.
If you don't know how to send Bitcoins, visit Google.

Send 2000 USD to this Bitcoin address immediately:

35sfKMk8NVUtzGsqpWvfzgjdiS6wz961de
(copy and paste)

1 BTC = 3470 USD right now, so send exactly 0.583427 BTC
to the address above.

Do not try to cheat me!
As soon as you open this Email I will know you opened it.

This Bitcoin address is linked to you only,
so I will know if you sent the correct amount.
When you pay in full, I will remove both files and deactivate my software.

If you don't send the payment, I will send your masturbation video
to ALL YOUR FRIENDS AND ASSOCIATES from your contact list I hacked.

Here are the payment details again:
